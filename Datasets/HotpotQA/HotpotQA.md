**Question:** Which rebellion did Sir John Wedderburn and Charles Edward Stuart fight for that ended with defeat at the Battle of Culloden?
**Answer:** the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745

**Context:**
The "lost portrait" of Charles Edward Stuart is a portrait, painted in late autumn 1745 by Scottish artist Allan Ramsay, of Charles Edward Stuart, also known as the Young Pretender or Bonnie Prince Charlie. Charles Edward Louis John Casimir Sylvester Severino Maria Stuart (31 December 1720 – 31 January 1788), commonly known in Britain during his lifetime as The Young Pretender and The Young Chevalier, and often known in retrospective accounts as Bonnie Prince Charlie, was the second Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England, Scotland, France and Ireland (as Charles III) from the death of his father in 1766. This claim was based on his status as the eldest son of James Francis Edward Stuart, himself the son of James VII and II. Charles is perhaps best known as the instigator of the unsuccessful Jacobite uprising of 1745, in which he led an insurrection to restore his family to the throne of Great Britain. The uprising ended in defeat at the Battle of Culloden, effectively terminating the Jacobite cause. Jacobites supported the Stuart claim because they hoped for religious toleration for Roman Catholics and because they believed in the divine right of kings. Charles's flight from Scotland after the uprising has rendered him a romantic figure of heroic failure in some later representations. In 1759 he was involved in a French plan to invade Britain, which was abandoned after British naval victories. Sir John Wedderburn, 5th Baronet of Blackness was a Perthshire gentleman who joined the 1745 rebellion of Charles Edward Stuart and, captured at the Battle of Culloden, was afterwards convicted of treason. He was hanged, his estates were forfeit to the Crown, and his family was attainted. Sir John Wedderburn of Ballindean, 6th Baronet of Blackness (1729–1803) was a Scottish landowner who made a fortune in the West Indian sugar trade. Born into a family of impoverished Perthshire gentry, his father was executed for treason following the Jacobite uprising of 1745, and the young Wedderburn was forced to flee to the West Indies, where he eventually became the largest landowner in Jamaica. In 1769 he returned to Scotland with a slave, one Joseph Knight, who, inspired by Somersett's Case in England, in which the English courts had held that slavery did not exist under English law, brought suit against Wedderburn for his freedom. Knight won his claim, establishing the principle that Scots law would not uphold the institution of slavery. Wedderburn ended his days as a wealthy country gentleman, having restored his family fortune and recovered the title Baronet of Blackness. "The Skye Boat Song" is a Scottish folk song, which can be played as a waltz, recalling the escape of Prince Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) from Uist to the Isle of Skye after his defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Culloden Tower was built as a parkland ornament or folly in about 1746 on the estate of John Yorke MP, at Richmond, North Yorkshire. It is also known as The Cumberland Temple, in celebration of the victorious Duke of Cumberland's army over the forces of the pretender Prince Charles Edward Stuart at the battle of Culloden in 1746. The Jacobite rising of 1745 (Scottish Gaelic: "Bliadhna Theàrlaich" ] , "The Year of Charles") was the attempt by Charles Edward Stuart to regain the British throne for the exiled House of Stuart. The rising occurred during the War of the Austrian Succession, when most of the British Army was on the European continent. Charles Edward Stuart, commonly known as "Bonnie Prince Charlie" or "the Young Pretender", sailed to Scotland and raised the Jacobite standard at Glenfinnan in the Scottish Highlands, where he was supported by a gathering of Highland clansmen. The march south began with an initial victory at Prestonpans near Edinburgh. The Jacobite army, now in bold spirits, marched onwards to Carlisle, over the border in England. When it reached Derby, some British divisions were recalled from the Continent and the Jacobite army retreated north to Inverness where the last battle on Scottish soil took place on a nearby moor at Culloden. The Battle of Culloden ended with the final defeat of the Jacobite cause. Charles Edward Stuart fled with a price on his head before finally sailing to France. The Battle of Prestonpans was the first significant conflict in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. The battle took place at 4 am on 21 September 1745. The Jacobite army loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart and led by his son Charles Edward Stuart defeated the government army loyal to the Hanoverian George II led by Sir John Cope. The inexperienced government troops were outflanked and broke in the face of a highland charge. The victory was a huge morale boost for the Jacobites, and a heavily mythologised version of the story entered art and legend. The Wedderburn, later Ogilvy-Wedderburn Baronetcy, of Balindean in the County of Perth, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom created in 1803. The baronetcy is a revival of an earlier title held by the family, which had been forfeited in 1746. John Wedderburn was an advocate and Clerk of Bills. On 9 August 1704 he was created a baronet, of Balindean in the County of Perth, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. On the death of the third Baronet in 1723 the title was inherited by Alexander Wedderburn, the fourth Baronet, who was the nephew of the first Baronet. The fifth Baronet was a Jacobite and fought at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, where he was taken prisoner. He was executed for treason in November of the same year, with his title and estates forfeited. However, his descendants continued to claim the title. On 18 August 1803 David Wedderburn, "7th Baronet of Balindean" (but for the attainder), was created a baronet, of Balindean in the County of Perth, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to the heirs male of the fourth Baronet of the 1704 creation. Wedderburn later represented Perth Burghs in the House of Commons and served as Postmaster-General for Scotland. Prince Charlies Cave, is a cave where Charles Edward Stuart was said to have sheltered there for 5 days in 1746, when on the run from the Duke of Cumberland, after the defeat at the Battle of Culloden.

**Question:** What where both Hawker Hurricane and No. 1455 Flight apart of?
**Answer:** Royal Air Force

**Context:**
The Supermarine Seafire was a naval version of the Supermarine Spitfire adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. In concept, it is relatively comparable to the Hawker Sea Hurricane, a navalised version of the Spitfire's stablemate, the Hawker Hurricane. The name Seafire had been derived from the abbreviation of the longer name Sea Spitfire. The Flying Legend Hawker Hurricane Replica is an Italian light-sport aircraft, designed and produced by Flying Legend of Caltagirone and introduced at the AERO Friedrichshafen show in 2011. The aircraft, a 72% scale replica of the British Hawker Hurricane Second World War fighter, is supplied as a kit for amateur construction or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft. The Hawker Typhoon (Tiffy in RAF slang), is a British single-seat fighter-bomber, produced by Hawker Aircraft. It was intended to be a medium–high altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement. The Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) operated the British Hawker Hurricane Mk I fighter aircraft from 1938 to 1941. Between 1938 and 1940, the VVKJ obtained 24 Hurricane Mk I's from early production batches, marking the first foreign sale of the aircraft. Twenty additional aircraft were built by Zmaj under licence in Yugoslavia. When the country was drawn into World War II by the German-led Axis invasion of April 1941, a total of 41 Hurricane Mk I's were in service as fighters. They achieved some successes against "Luftwaffe" aircraft, but all Yugoslav Hurricanes were destroyed or captured during the 11-day invasion. No. 1300 (Meteorological) Flight was formed on 31 July 1943 at RAF Alipore, West Bengal, British India, by re-designating No. 1 Meteorological Flight RAF. The flight, strength of which had been reduced to three Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIs by this time, was disbanded on 30 May 1946 at RAF Kallang, Malaya, as No. 1300 (Meteorological THUM) Flight, THUM standing for Temperature and Humidity. No. 1455 (Fighter) Flight was formed at RAF Tangmere, West Sussex on 7 July 1941, equipped with Turbinlite Douglas Boston and Douglas Havoc aircraft. On operations they co-operated with the Hawker Hurricanes of 1 Squadron and 3 Squadron. The flight was replaced with 534 Squadron on 2 September 1942. The Hawker Tornado was a British single-seat fighter aircraft design of World War II for the Royal Air Force as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane. The planned production of Tornados was cancelled after the engine it was designed to use—the Rolls-Royce Vulture—proved unreliable in service. A parallel airframe with the Napier Sabre continued into production as the Hawker Typhoon. The Sindlinger HH-1 Hawker Hurricane is a ⅝ scale homebuilt design based on the Hawker Hurricane. Designed by Fred Sindlinger for amateur construction, the prototype was built between 1969 and 1972. The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930s–1940s that was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Although overshadowed by the Supermarine Spitfire, the aircraft became renowned during the Battle of Britain, accounting for 60 percent of the RAF air victories in the battle, and served in all the major theatres of the Second World War. The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) is a Royal Air Force flight which provides an aerial display group usually comprising an Avro Lancaster, a Supermarine Spitfire and a Hawker Hurricane. The aircraft are regularly seen at events commemorating the Second World War and upon British State occasions, notably Trooping the Colour, celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday in 2006, as well as the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine Middleton in 2011 and at air displays throughout the United Kingdom and Europe.

**Question:** The Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust promotes the restoration of what navigable canal in England?
**Answer:** Shropshire Union Canal

**Context:**
Navigable aqueducts (sometimes called water bridges) are bridge structures that carry navigable waterway canals over other rivers, valleys, railways or roads. They are primarily distinguished by their size, carrying a larger cross-section of water than most water-supply aqueducts. Although Roman aqueducts were sometimes used for transport, aqueducts were not generally used until the 17th century when the problems of summit level canals had been solved and modern canal systems were developed. The 662-metre long steel Briare aqueduct carrying the Canal latéral à la Loire over the River Loire was built in 1896. It was ranked as the longest navigable aqueduct in the world for more than a century, until the Magdeburg Water Bridge in Germany took the title in the early 21st century. The Droitwich Canals Trust is an English limited company created in 1973 to work towards the restoration of the Droitwich Canal. From 2001 it worked as part of a larger group, the Droitwich Canals Restoration Partnership, and in 2004, following a successful application for a grant of £4.6 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund surrendered its lease on the canal to British Waterways, who then managed the restoration through to the reopening of the canals in 2011. The Cotswold Canals Trust (previously the Stroudwater and Thames and Severn Canal Trust) is an English registered charity that aims to protect and restore the Stroudwater Navigation and the Thames and Severn Canal. The group was founded in 1972, and was initially called the Stroudwater Canal Society. The society became the Stroudwater, Thames and Severn Canal Trust in 1975 as the scope of the project increased, and subsequently became the Cotswold Canals Trust in July 1990. The Ayurvedic Trust (AVT), founded in 1950, is a health-related trust in India. It is headquartered at Coimbatore, the second largest city of Tamil Nadu in India. P.S.G. Venkataswamy Naidu and The Arya Vaidya Pharmacy (Cbe) Ltd were instrumental in establishing this trust. The trust promotes authentic Ayurveda, clinical practices based on Ayurveda theories on health and life, research in Ayurveda and awareness on Ayurveda among common public and global scientific community. The Ayurvedic Trust also runs Ayurveda hospitals including The Arya Vaidya Chikitsalayam and Research Institute, which has treated numerous national and international personalities including the former presidents and prime ministers of India. The Shropshire Union Canal is a navigable canal in England. The Llangollen and Montgomery canals are the modern names of branches of the Shropshire Union ("SU") system and lie partially in Wales. The Shrewsbury & Newport Canals Trust is a waterway society and a registered charity which exists to promote the restoration of the Shrewsbury Canal and the Newport Arm of the Shropshire Union Canal. The trust was created in 2000. The Shrewsbury Canal (or Shrewsbury and Newport Canal) was a canal in Shropshire, England. Authorised in 1793, the main line from Trench to Shrewsbury was fully open by 1797, but it remained isolated from the rest of the canal network until 1835, when the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal built the Newport Branch from Norbury Junction to a new junction with the Shrewsbury Canal at Wappenshall. After ownership passed to a series of railway companies, the canal was officially abandoned in 1944; many sections have disappeared, though some bridges and other structures can still be found. There is an active campaign to preserve the remnants of the canal and to restore the Norbury to Shrewsbury line to navigation. The Stainforth and Keadby Canal is a navigable canal in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, England. It connects the River Don Navigation at Bramwith to the River Trent at Keadby, by way of Stainforth, Thorne and Ealand, near Crowle. It opened in 1802, passed into the control of the River Don Navigation in 1849, and within a year was controlled by the first of several railway companies. It became part of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, an attempt to remove several canals from railway control, in 1895. There were plans to upgrade it to take larger barges and to improve the port facilities at Keadby, but the completion of the New Junction Canal in 1905 made this unnecessary, as Goole could easily be reached and was already a thriving port. A contour canal is an artificially-dug navigable canal which closely follows the contour line of the land it traverses in order to avoid costly engineering works such as boring a tunnel through higher ground, building an embankment over lower ground, or constructing a canal lock (or series of locks) to change the level of the canal. Because of this, these canals are characterised by their meandering course. The Miranda Naturalists' Trust is a charitable trust, that established and maintains the Miranda Shorebird Centre, located at Miranda on the western shore of the Firth of Thames on the North Island of New Zealand. The Miranda Naturalists' Trust (MNT) was formed in 1975 to encourage people to visit the coastline and appreciate its wide range of flora and fauna. The trust promotes education and public awareness of coastal ecology, shorebird research and conservation. Work done by the trust, to increase knowledge of shorebird migration, includes bird banding, research and data exchange. The Shorebird Centre has information displays on waders and a library and helps raise funds for the trust's work through their shop sales and visitor accommodation.

**Question:** Were both the Battle of Stones River and the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River fought in the 19th century?
**Answer:** no

**Context:**
The Battle of Glendale was a battle fought on the Inner Hebridean island of Skye, between the MacDonalds of Sleat and the MacDonalds of Clanranald, against the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan and the MacLeods of Lewis. According to MacLeod tradition preserved in the early 19th century, the battle was fought in about the year 1490; yet it has been recently suggested that the battle more likely took place sometime after 1513. MacLeod tradition records that the battle was the 'most tremendous battle' that the clan ever fought—although the clan was victorious, it never fully recovered from its severe losses. MacLeod tradition relates how the MacDonalds originally had the upper hand during the conflict, but when the MacLeod's sacred Fairy Flag was unfurled the MacLeods gained heart and won the battle. The Battle of Berestechko (Polish: "Bitwa pod Beresteczkiem" ; Ukrainian: Берестецька битва, Битва під Берестечком ) was fought between the Ukrainian Cossacks, led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, aided by their Crimean Tatar allies, and a Polish army under King John II Casimir. It was a battle of a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine that took place in the years 1648–1657 after the expiration of a two-year truce. Fought from 28 to 30 June 1651, the battle took place in the province of Volhynia, on the hilly plain south of the Styr River. The Polish camp was on the river opposite Berestechko and faced south, towards the Cossack army about two kilometers away, whose right flank was against the River Pliashivka (Pliashova) and the Tatar army on their left flank. It was probably the largest European land battle of the 17th century. Register Cliff is a sandstone cliff and featured key navigational landmark prominently listed in the 19th century guidebooks about the Oregon Trail, and a place where many emigrants chiseled the names of their families on the soft stones of the cliff it was one of the key checkpoint landmarks for parties heading west along the Platte River valley west of Fort John, Wyoming which allowed travelers to verify they were on the correct path up to South Pass and not moving into impassable mountain terrainsgeographically, it is on the eastern ascent of the Continental divide leading upward out of the great plains in the east of the U.S. state of Wyoming. It is notable as a historic landmark for 'registering' hundreds of emigrants on the Oregon Trail (thus also the other northern Emigrant Trails that split off farther west such as the California Trail and Mormon Trail) who came to follow custom and inscribed their names on its rocks during the western migrations of the 19th century. An estimated 500,000 emigrants used these trails from 1843–1869, with up to one-tenth dying along the way, usually due to disease. The Umba River is located in northeastern Tanzania in Tanga Region. It rises in Schageiuforest (Shagayu) in the West Usambara Mountains at 2,000 m altitude and flows on the north side of the mountain range to the east. At Lelwa it empties the Mbalamu River, which comes from the extreme north of the Usambara Mountains, and the Mglumi River into the Umba. Just before the Umba flows into the Indian Ocean, it crosses the border to Kenya. The mouth itself marks the most eastern point on the border between Tanzania and Kenya, which was largely made in a straight line to the northwest towards Lake Victoria in the 19th Century. On the upper reaches of the river in the mid-1960s rich deposits of precious stones, including sapphires and Spessartine, were discovered. Also on the river is the Umba River Game Reserve, a wildlife reserve that includes along with the Mkomazi Game Reserve, about 2,600 km². The Battle of Stones River or Second Battle of Murfreesboro, was fought from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863, in Middle Tennessee, as the culmination of the Stones River Campaign in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides. Although the battle itself was inconclusive, the Union Army's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee. Joseph Leonard Follett (February 16, 1843 – April 1, 1907) was an American soldier who fought in the American Civil War. Follett received the country's highest award for bravery during combat, the Medal of Honor, for his action during the Battle of Island Number Ten in New Madrid, Missouri on 3 March 1862 and the Battle of Stones River in Tennessee on 31 December 1862. He was honored with the award on 19 September 1890. The Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, also known as the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on () or the Second Phase Campaign Western Sector (), was a decisive battle in the Korean War, and it took place from November 25 to December 2, 1950, along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley in the northwestern part of North Korea. In response to the successful Chinese First Phase Campaign against the United Nations forces, General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive to evict the Chinese forces from Korea and to end the war. Anticipating this reaction, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai planned a counteroffensive, dubbed the "Second Phase Campaign", against the advancing UN forces. Savage's Station was the wartime name of a supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War. Savage's Station was located in Henrico County, Virginia on what was the Richmond and York River Railroad, however the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, the railroad track's current owner, has no record that an actual train station or station house ever existed on the property. A farmhouse is known to have been located in a copse of trees on a small knoll next to the railroad track and is visible in several period drawings and photographs made during the war. The house served as the nucleus of a large field hospital during and after the battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles. The house also functioned as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862. Although the house survived the battle in 1862, it was burned by Federal cavalry under General Philip H. Sheridan in 1864. The house appears to have never been rebuilt, and no trace of it remains today. However, a smokehouse from the 19th century still existed on the property as late as the 1930s when it was photographed during a survey of local historical structures as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The smokehouse fell into ruin and collapsed sometime prior to the 1980s. A small brick-walled cemetery from the 18th century still sits near the former location of the house not far from the railroad track. The Collins Ferry Historic District encompasses two historic farmsteads, as well as a mill and ferry site on the Staunton River in rural northern Halifax County, Virginia, west of Brookneal. The district covers 768 acre , extending south from the river roughly to Bull Creek Road, and westward from the mouth of Buffalo Creek, which roughly bisects the district. The Collins Farm, which is located at the end of McKeever's Trail, includes one of Halifax County's best-preserved Federal style plantation houses, built c. 1810 and located on a bluff overlooking the creek. The Collins Farm includes 19th century farm outbuildings, the family cemetery, a mill site along the river, and the site where stones for the mill's construction and grinding stones were quarried. The Hubbard Farm is located south and east of the Collins Farm, and is accessed via a private drive that forms part of the historic road leading to Collins Ferry. Hubbard Farm includes a Greek Revival farmhouse built in 1856, and also includes 19th century outbuildings, a family cemetery, and the remains of a slave quarters. The military history of Mexico consists of several millennia of armed conflicts within what is now that nation's territory and includes activities of the Mexican military in peacekeeping and combat related affairs worldwide. Wars between prehispanic peoples marked the beginning of Mexico's military history, the most notable of these fought in the form of a "flower war". After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, indigenous tribes were defeated by Spain, thus beginning a three century era of Spanish dominance. Mexico's struggle for independence began primarily in the 19th century, and was marked by internal conflict of early rulers after defeating the Spanish in 1821. The Mexican–American War in the mid 19th century ended in the defeat of Mexican forces, and the loss of two-fifths of the national territory. In the remainder of the 19th century, a series of conflicts began in Mexico, as the War of the Reform and the defeat of the French during their intervention in Mexico marked events in that era.

Still Kicking: Six Artistic Women of Project Arts & Longevity is a 2006 32-minute documentary film by Pacific Grove filmmaker Greg Young, featuring six Bay Area women role models over 85 years old who remained artistically active. The catalyst for Young's film was Amy Gorman and Frances Kandl's Project Arts & Longevity through which they were exploring the link between longevity and artistic vitality. Along with the film the joint project resulted in a book entitled Aging Artfully. The 1943 Naples post office bombing occurred on October 7, 1943, after the U.S. Fifth Army had captured Naples (October 1) and reached the Volturno River (October 6). The Central Post Office Building, an imposing structure completed in 1936 and located in the center of the city, was looted by the Nazi troops during the occupation and after their retreat was occupied by families made homeless by the bombing and destruction heaped on the city during the insurrection, known as the ""Four days of Naples"", that had taken place a few weeks earlier. On that morning a series of violent explosions ripped through the building and caused heavy damage to the surrounding buildings and the death of more than 100 people, including women, children and members of a 82nd Airborne Division unit.

Before kicking the field goal, teammates saw that O'Brien was so nervous, he tried to take some of the artificial turf off the field to figure out the wind, thinking the field was regular grass. Because of his singular moment kicking the Super Bowl-winning field goal, NFL Films named him the #9 "One-Hit Wonder" of all time.

**Question:** The House of Hanover held the British throne until after Victoria's death, when it was past to the dynasty that ruled which duchy?
**Answer:** Ernestine

**Context:**
The House of Hanover (or the Hanoverians ; German: "Haus Hannover" ) is a German royal dynasty that ruled the Electorate and then the Kingdom of Hanover, and that also provided monarchs of Great Britain and Ireland from 1714 and ruled the United Kingdom until the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. Upon Victoria's death, the British throne passed to her eldest son Edward VII, a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha through his father. The House of Oldenburg is a European dynasty of North German origin. It is one of Europe's most influential royal houses, with branches that rule or have ruled in Denmark, Iceland, Greece, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Schleswig, Holstein, and Oldenburg. The current Queen of Denmark and King of Norway, the former King of Greece, the consorts of Greece and the United Kingdom, as well as the first twelve names in the line of succession to the British throne, are all patrilineal members of the Glücksburg branch of this house. Prince Christian of Hanover (Christian Heinrich Clemens Paul Frank Peter Welf Wilhelm-Ernst Friedrich Franz Prince of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg; born 1 June 1985) is the younger son of Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, and his first wife Chantal Hochuli. He is the second in the line of succession to the former Hanoverian throne, after his elder brother Prince Ernst August. As a descendant of George III of the United Kingdom, Christian is also in the line of succession to the British throne. The Duchy of Bernstadt (German: "Herzogtum Bernstadt" , Polish: "Księstwo bierutowskie" , ) was a Silesian duchy centred on the city of Bernstadt (present-day Bierutów) in Lower Silesia (now in Poland) and formed by separation from the Duchy of Oels (Oleśnica). It was first ruled by the Silesian Piasts dynasty, until its extinction in 1492. In 1495 it and the Duchy of Oels passed to the Dukes of Münsterberg, who came from the House of Poděbrady. In 1647 the Duchy of Bernstadt passed by marriage to the Dukes of Württemberg. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was founded in 1569. It succeeded the Duchy of Florence. The grand duchy was initially ruled by the House of Medici, until their extinction in 1737. The grand duchy passed to the House of Lorraine, and then, to its cadet branch, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. The House of Habsburg Lorraine ruled Tuscany from 1765–1801, and then 1814–1859. The Principality of Calenberg was a dynastic division of the Welf duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg established in 1432. Calenberg was ruled by the House of Hanover from 1635 onwards; the princes received the ninth electoral dignity of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. Their territory became the nucleus of the Electorate of Hanover, ruled in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain from 1714 onwards. The principality received its name from Calenberg Castle, a residence of the Brunswick dukes. Ernest Augustus (5 June 1771 – 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 until his death. He was the fifth son and eighth child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, Ernest seemed unlikely to become a monarch, but none of his four elder brothers had a legitimate son who survived infancy. The Salic Law, which barred succession to or through a female, prevailed in Hanover; therefore, when his elder brother King William IV died in 1837, Ernest succeeded him as King of Hanover. In the United Kingdom the succession to the monarchy was determined by primogeniture and his niece Victoria succeeded to the throne, thus ending the personal union between the British Isles and Hanover that had existed since 1714. The Royal House of Boureh Gnilane Joof (variation : Mbin Boureh Gnilane in Serer) was a royal house founded in the 14th century by Jaraff Boureh Gnilane Joof (var : "Bouré Gnilane Diouf" or "Buré Ñilaan"). He was a member the Serer tribe, from the pre-colonial Kingdom of Sine now part of independent Senegal. It was the first royal house founded by the Joof family during the Guelowar period (1350 - 1969). Boureh Gnilane Joof was a royal prince and a Jaraff (var : "Diaraf"), a with the powers of a Prime Minister. He was neither a Maad a Sinig (king of Sine) nor a Maad Saloum (king of Saloum) but a royal prince who had the title "Jaraff" bestowed upon him by his cousin and brother-in-law - Maad a Sinig Diessanou Faye (king of Sine). His father Maad Patar Kholleh Joof (the conqueror) was the king of Laa and Teigne of Baol (king of Baol). Boureh's brothers were the first from this house to have succeeded to the throne of Sine during the Guelowar period. His name was adopted in his honour to refer to the first royal house founded by the Joof family during this dynastic period. The Joof family of Sine, from this royal house also ruled in the Kingdom of Saloum (the Joof paternal dynasty of Sine and Saloum) The Joof family also ruled in Baol (the Joof paternal dynasty of Baol). From the date of its foundation up to the abolition of the Serer monarchies of Sine and Saloum in 1969, at least ten kings from this house had succeeded to the throne of Sine. As the first royal house of Sine founded by the Joof family in this dynastic period, the Royal House of Boureh Gnilane Joof holds great significance in Senegambian, Joof family and , because all the subsequent royal houses founded by the Joof family (who ruled in three Senegambian kingdoms) branched out from this royal house. Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, gender (for people born before October 2011), legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover that are in "communion with the Church of England". Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ( ; German: "") is a German dynasty that ruled the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which was one of the Ernestine duchies. It is a cadet branch of the Saxon House of Wettin.

The Far West (Chinese and Japanese: 泰西: "tàixī; "rōmaji": taisei " ) is a Chinese and Japanese term that refers to Europe, or more broadly, to the entire Western world. Originally a name for parts of Inner Asia and India, the term Far West as a Chinese exonym for the West was coined by the Italian Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Ricci invented the phrase as an Asian parallel to the Eurocentric notion of the Far East, which positioned Europe as a region on the fringes of a Sinocentric world. The term Far West was also used in Japan and appears in many Japanese publications.

**Question:** Who is younger, Terry Glaze or Hayley Williams?
**Answer:** Hayley Williams

**Context:**
Hayley Williams (born June 3, 1990) is an American professional ice hockey player for the Brampton Thunder of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL). Williams has previously played for the Buffalo Beauts in the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL). Kate McTell (born Ruthy Kate Williams; August 22, 1911 – October 3, 1991) was an American blues musician and nurse from Jefferson County, Georgia. She is known primarily as the former wife of the blues musician Blind Willie McTell, whom she accompanied vocally on several recordings. She may have recorded as Ruby Glaze, but there is some uncertainty about whether she and Glaze were the same person, despite the fact that she claimed to be Glaze. Terrence Lee Glaze (born November 29, 1964, Columbus), known as Terry Lee, is a Texas-raised singer and guitarist who is most known for his work in American heavy metal bands Lord Tracy and Pantera. "The Only Exception" is a song by American rock band Paramore. It was released by Fueled by Ramen in February 2010 as the third single from the band's third studio album, "Brand New Eyes" (2009). The song was written by band members Hayley Williams and Josh Farro; Paramore is also credited as being co-producers to the song. The song was generally well received by music critics; praise of the song was mainly about Williams' vocal performance. Music critics reviewing the song noted that "The Only Exception" was a different musical theme for the band. I Am the Night is the third studio album by heavy metal band Pantera, released in 1985 through Metal Magic Records. The album was made available only on vinyl and cassette, with any subsequent CD releases being bootlegs transferred from the vinyl or tape originals. Some of Pantera's faster and heavier influences are more apparent on "I Am the Night", especially on the title track, "Valhalla" and "Down Below" (which was re-recorded for their next album "Power Metal"). Guitar solos took on character, hinting at Dimebag Darrell's later style. It was also the last album to feature lead singer Terry Glaze. The band made their second music video for the track "Hot and Heavy". Andrew Glaze (April 21, 1920 – February 7, 2016) was an American poet, playwright and novelist. Much of Glaze's poetry reflects his coming of age in the South, and his eventual return there. He also lived and wrote in New York City for 31 years. In New York City he became part of a circle of poets that included Oscar Williams, Norman Rosten, John Ciardi and William Packard. Pantera was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas. The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers – drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell – along with lead vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing Tommy D. Bradford, who was the unofficial original. Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released four albums during the 1980s. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Phil Anselmo in late 1986 and released "Power Metal" in 1988. With its fifth album, 1990's "Cowboys from Hell", Pantera introduced a groove metal sound. Pantera's sixth album, 1992's "Vulgar Display of Power", exhibited an even heavier sound. " Far Beyond Driven" (1994) debuted at number one on the "Billboard" 200. Hayley Nichole Williams (born December 27, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter and musician. She serves as the lead vocalist, primary songwriter and occasional keyboardist of the rock band Paramore. The band was formed in 2004 by Josh Farro, Zac Farro, Jeremy Davis and Williams. The band consists of Hayley Williams, Zac Farro and Taylor York. The band has five studio albums: "All We Know Is Falling" (2005), "Riot! " (2007), "Brand New Eyes" (2009), "Paramore" (2013) and "After Laughter" (2017). American rock band Paramore have recorded songs for five studio albums, a box set, an extended play and two soundtrack albums. In 2002, at age 13, vocalist Hayley Williams moved to Franklin, Tennessee, where she met brothers Josh Farro and Zac Farro. The band was officially formed by Josh Farro (lead guitar and backing vocals), Zac Farro (drums), Jeremy Davis (bass guitar) and Williams (lead vocals) in 2004, with the later addition of Williams' neighbor Jason Bynum (rhythm guitar). In 2005, Paramore signed with the New York City-based Fueled by Ramen and released their debut album entitled "All We Know Is Falling" that year. Three singles were released to promote the album. "Stay the Night" is a song by Russian-German electronic dance music producer Zedd, from the deluxe edition (2013) of his debut studio album, "Clarity " (2012). It features vocals from Hayley Williams, the lead singer of American rock group Paramore. The song was written by Zedd, Williams, Benjamin Eli Hanna, and Carah Faye. "Stay the Night" was released to digital retailers on September 10, 2013, by Interscope Records as the lead single off the deluxe edition of "Clarity", and the fourth overall single from the album.

**Question:** Of four Harry S. Truman Supreme Court candidates, who was the 53rd United States Secretary of the Treasury and the 13th Chief Justice of the United States?
**Answer:** Fred M. Vinson

**Context:**
The Chief Justice is the presiding member of a supreme court in any of many countries with a justice system based on English common law, such as the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Supreme Court of Singapore, the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of Japan, the Supreme Court of India, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Supreme Court of Nepal, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, the Supreme Court of Ireland, the Supreme Court of New Zealand, the High Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of the United States, and provincial or state supreme courts. Enrique Medina Fernando (July 25, 1915 – October 13, 2004) was the 13th Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines. A noted constitutionalist and law professor, he served in the Supreme Court for 18 years, including 6 years as Chief Justice. The Supreme Court is composed of the Chief Justice, twenty Justices. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. S/he is appointed from among the justices having at least three years as a Supreme Court justice. Justices of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President of Nepal on the recommendation of the Judicial Council. The Chief Justice and the justices of the Supreme Court have to be confirmed by the Parliamentary Hearing Committee before they can be appointed by the President. The administrative head of the Supreme Court is the Chief Registrar. In addition to the Chief Registrar, one Registrar and four Joint-Registrar are appointed to led different departments of the Supreme Court and offer administrative assistance to the Court. Officers of the Supreme Court are appointed by Government of Nepal under the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission. During his two terms in office, President Harry S. Truman appointed four members of the Supreme Court of the United States: Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, Associate Justice Harold Burton, Associate Justice Tom C. Clark, and Associate Justice Sherman Minton. The Jay Court refers to the Supreme Court of the United States from 1789 to 1795, when John Jay served as the first Chief Justice of the United States. Jay served as Chief Justice until his resignation, at which point John Rutledge took office as a recess appointment. The Supreme Court was established in Article III of the United States Constitution, but the workings of the federal court system were largely laid out by the Judiciary Act of 1789, which set the size of the Supreme Court at six seats. The court had its first public session in February 1790, but did not decide its first case until 1791. The court met first in New York City, but moved with the rest of the federal government to Philadelphia in 1791. In addition to their duties as a court, each justice spent much of his time riding circuit outside of the capital. The court decided relatively few cases, and perhaps the most important legacy of the court was its refusal to issue an advisory opinion sought by President George Washington, establishing a precedent that the court only hears cases and controversies. The relative unimportance of the Supreme Court at this time is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that Jay, the sitting Chief Justice, traveled to the United Kingdom in 1794 to negotiate the Jay Treaty for the Washington Administration. The Rehnquist Court refers to the Supreme Court of the United States from 1986 to 2005, when William Rehnquist served as Chief Justice of the United States. Rehnquist succeeded Warren Burger as Chief Justice after the latter's retirement, and Rehnquist served as Chief Justice until his death in 2005, at which point John Roberts was nominated and confirmed as Rehnquist's replacement. The Rehnquist Court is generally considered to be more conservative than the preceding Burger Court and Warren Court. According to Jeffrey Rosen, Rehnquist combined an amiable nature with great organizational skill, and he "led a Court that put the brakes on some of the excesses of the Earl Warren era while keeping pace with the sentiments of a majority of the country." Biographer John Jenkins argued that Rehnquist politicized the Supreme Court and moved the court and the country to the right. Through its rulings, the Rehnquist Court often promoted a policy of New Federalism in which more power was given to the states at the expense of the federal government. The Rehnquist Court was also notable for its stability, as the same nine justices served together from 1994 to 2005, the longest such stretch in Supreme Court history. Thomas Royal Phillips (born October 23, 1949) is an attorney with the Baker Botts firm in Austin, Texas, who was from 1988 to 2004 the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas. With nearly seventeen years of service, Phillips is the third-longest tenured Chief Justice in Texas history. He was appointed by Governor Bill Clements to fill a vacancy in the office in November 1987, becoming the youngest Chief Justice since Texas became a state. Phillips took office less than a month after CBS' "60 Minutes" ran a highly publicized story, entitled "Justice for Sale? ," which won widespread attention for its blistering critique of Texas' choice to elect judges by political party without campaign contribution limits. The broadcast alleged improperly close ties between several of the justices and their largest donors, who were amongst the state's most successful personal-injury trial lawyers. In campaigns that received national attention in 1988, Phillips and two other candidates running as Republicans won election to the Court by imposing voluntary limits on the size of campaign contributions. By winning, they joined Railroad Commissioner Ken Hance as the first Republican elected to statewide office since Reconstruction. Phillips, after serving the two years remaining on the term of his predecessor, Chief Justice John L. Hill, was elected to a full term in 1990. In each race he defeated one of his Democratic colleagues on the Court, Ted Z. Robertson in 1988 and Oscar H. Mauzy in 1990, who defended Texas' partisan judicial election system and declined to impose campaign contribution caps. Throughout his tenure, Phillips vigorously advocated a non-partisan appointment-retention election method of choosing Texas judges. While he was ultimately unsuccessful in this effort, like other Texas chief justices before and since, both the Legislature and the Supreme Court imposed restrictions on the amount, timing and source of campaign contributions to judges during his tenure. The Taft Court refers to the Supreme Court of the United States from 1921 to 1930, when William Howard Taft served as Chief Justice of the United States. Taft succeeded Edward Douglass White as Chief Justice after the latter's death, and Taft served as Chief Justice until his resignation, at which point Charles Evans Hughes was nominated and confirmed as Taft's replacement. Taft is the only person to serve as both President of the United States and Chief Justice. The Taft Court continued the Lochner era and largely reflected the conservatism of the 1920s. The Taft Court is also notable for being the first court able to exert some control over its own docket, as the Judiciary Act of 1925 instituted the requirement that almost all cases receive a writ of certiorari from four justices before appearing before the Supreme Court. Frederick "Fred" Moore Vinson (January 22, 1890 – September 8, 1953) was an American Democratic politician who served the United States in all three branches of government. The most prominent member of the Vinson political family, he was the 53rd United States Secretary of the Treasury and the 13th Chief Justice of the United States. Priyasath Dep PC is a Sri Lankan judge and lawyer and the 45th Chief Justice of Sri Lanka . He was a sitting judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Prior to his appointment as Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka he was serving as Solicitor General of Sri Lanka. On February 27th 2017 he was nominated by the Constitutional Council as the 45th Chief Justice of Sri Lanka

**Question:** The hip hop group Strange Fruit Project relates its name to what song by a famous female jazz musician and singer known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills?
**Answer:** "Strange Fruit"

**Context:**
Arturo O'Farrill (born June 22, 1960) is a jazz musician, the son of Latin jazz musician, arranger and bandleader Chico O'Farrill, and current pianist, composer, and director for the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra. He is best known for his contributions to contemporary Latin jazz (more specifically Afro-Cuban jazz), having received two Grammy Awards and four Grammy nominations for his work in the genre, though he has also trained in other musical forms such as free jazz and even experimented briefly with hip hop. Larry Darnell Griffin Jr., professionally known as Symbolyc One or S1, is an American record producer from Waco, Texas. He founded the group Strange Fruit Project and is signed to Kanye West's Very GOOD Beats as a producer. Strange Fruit is a 1944 bestselling novel debut by American author Lillian Smith that dealt with the then-forbidden and controversial theme of interracial romance. The title was originally "Jordan is so Chilly", with Smith later changing the title to "Strange Fruit". In her autobiography, singer Billie Holiday wrote that Smith chose to name the book after her song "Strange Fruit", which was about the lynching and racism against African-Americans, although Smith maintained that the book's title referred to the "damaged, twisted people (both black and white) who are the products or results of our racist culture." The Dream Merchant Vol. 2 is the second compilation album from producer 9th Wonder, formerly of Little Brother. It was released on October 9, 2007 through Sixhole Records. The album has guest appearances by his former group, Little Brother, his fellow Justus League members, Sean Price, Big Dho, L.E.G.A.C.Y., Chaundon, Skyzoo, Keisha Shontelle, Big Treal, The A.L.L.I.E.S., Jozeemo, Tyler Woods, Joe Scudda, Buckshot, Sean Boog, D.O.X., O-Dash, Buddy Klein & Median, also outside performers (including some who 9th worked with) including Torae, Mos Def, Memphis Bleek, Jean Grae, Royce Da 5'9, Vandalyzm, Naledge (½ of Kidz In The Hall), Saigon, Camp Lo, Ness (of Da Band), Strange Fruit Project & Natural Born Spittas. The album is also marks the debut of then-unknown MC, Rapsody. Strange Fruit Project is an underground hip hop group from Waco, Texas, which consists of producer and emcee Symbolyc One (also known as S1, born Larry D. Griffin Jr.), his cousin emcee Myth (short for Mythological, born Kevin Gaither) and emcee Myone (pronounced "My Own", born Anthony Ligawa, originally from Indiana). The trio officially debuted in 2004, with a pair of underground releases, "Soul Travelin" and "From Divine". Their biggest exposure came with the release of their acclaimed 2006 album "The Healing". The group's name is derived from the Billie Holiday civil rights song "Strange Fruit". Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959), professionally known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed "Lady Day" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. There were other jazz singers with comparable talent, but Holiday had a voice that captured the attention of her audience. "Forbidden Fruit" is a song by American hip hop recording artist J. Cole. The song was sent to radio stations in August 2013, as the third official single from Cole's second studio album, "Born Sinner" (2013). "Forbidden Fruit" was produced by Cole himself and features a guest appearance from frequent collaborator and fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, who contributes vocals to the song's hook. The song features a sample of American jazz musician Ronnie Foster's "Mystic Brew", most recognized from its use on hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest's "Electric Relaxation". The song was met with mixed reviews from music critics. "Forbidden Fruit" would peak at number 46 on the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. We Are Smug is a collaborative studio album recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Darren Hayes and producer and songwriter Robert Conley under the pseudonym We Are Smug. Originally intended as an anonymous secret side project for Hayes to experiment with new sounds, the album was given away for free for a limited period via digital download as a gift to fans on Hayes' birthday on 8 May 2009 but all free links have since been removed. Hayes has recently said he intends to commercially release the album with a bonus song at some point in the future. The album is an eclectic and experimental vehicle where Hayes adopted various personas and experimented with vocal delivery and genre in a way he had never done as a mainstream artist. It is unique as a recording because Hayes shares vocal duties with Conley, sometimes swapping out the lead for backing vocals. Hayes takes the lead on about half the album at varying times changing his voice, alternating between a high falsetto, a lower raspy tone, experimenting with hip hop and beach boys styled harmonies. The Healing is the third album by underground hip hop group Strange Fruit Project, released July 25, 2006 on Om Records. The album was generally well-received, and drew the group comparisons to underground peers like Little Brother. The release was beloved by underground fans for its "Golden Age" style similar to that of the Native Tongues Posse, with Jazzy production and socially conscious lyrical content. Allmusic gave the album a 3⁄ Star rating, and stated: "The Way I Rock My Clothes" is a single released by Hip-hop artist/Producer Funkghost. The song was released February 17, 2009 on Grand Extravagant Ent. The music video for "The Way I Rock My Clothes" was shot and released in late February 2009 to positive reviews. The song was produced by Symbolyc One of Strange Fruit Project. "The Way I Rock My Clothes" has been well received by critics and has since garnered mixshow airplay on FM stations across The United States.

Thornton–Cleveleys (originally simply-named Cleveleys) was a small-sized railway station which served the two English Lancashire towns of Thornton and Cleveleys, but was situated in the centre of Thornton. Located on the now disused line between Poulton-le-Fylde and Fleetwood , the station also had a shunting yard for the making-up of freight trains for Preston and beyond. During its life it was also known at times as Thornton station and Thornton for Cleveleys station. In the 1860s and early 1870s the line was of great importance being the direct route from London to Glasgow. Before the Shap route was opened, passengers (allegedly including Queen Victoria) would travel from Euston to Fleetwood and then onwards via steamer to Scotland. Hua Takhe Railway Station is a railway station located in Lat Krabang Subdistrict, Lat Krabang District, Bangkok. It is a class 1 railway station located 30.911 km from Bangkok Railway Station. This station is the nearest station to Suvarnabhumi Airport, as well as the nearest large railway station to King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. However, the nearest railway station to KMITL is Phra Chom Klao halt, located only 580 m from Hua Takhe Station. Hua Takhe is also the junction (although not officially one) for the freight-only line to the Inland Container Depot (ICD) Pattani Railway Station or Pattani (Khok Pho) Railway Station is a railway station located in Khok Pho Subdistrict, Khok Pho District, Pattani. It is a class 1 railway station located 1009.209 km from Thon Buri Railway Station. The station opened in April 1917 as Khok Pho Station, as part of the Southern Line section between U Taphao Junction (Hat Yai)-Khlong Sai. The line extended further south, terminating at Su-ngai Kolok in September 1921, where it linked up with the Malaysian railway. Pak Nam Pho Railway Station is a railway station located in Pak Nam Pho Subdistrict, Nakhon Sawan City, Nakhon Sawan. It is located 250.559 km from Bangkok Railway Station and is a class 1 railway station. It is on the Northern Line of the State Railway of Thailand. The station opened on 31 October 1905 as part of the Northern Line extension from Lop Buri to Pak Nam Pho. The line continued to Phitsanulok in 1908. Originally, this was the railway station for Nakhon Sawan City as passengers would alight here and cross the Chao Phraya River to reach the city, however its main purpose was removed as the new railway station built at Nong Pling replaced its role. Today, the station acts as a railyard, a railway maintenance centre and a junction for an occasionally-used freight line to Kamnansong Rice Mill. Poulton-le-Fylde railway station serves the town of Poulton-le-Fylde in Lancashire, England. It is managed by Northern, but also served by Virgin Trains and is 14+1/4 mi northwest of Preston. Ton Samrong Railway Station is a railway station located in Thammasala Subdistrict, Nakhon Pathom City, Nakhon Pathom. It is a class 3 railway station located 44.301 km from Thon Buri Railway Station. Originally, the station was built 300 metres from the present-day location, near a curve. But it was moved possibly because it was difficult to expand the railway station into a railyard, and there was not enough space near a curve for building the double-track section. Hilal railway station formerly Istravoz railway station is a railway station located in İzmir, Turkey. It is located east of Basmane next to the famous Hilal Junction on the Izmir-Afyon railway. The station was famous for being located next to the only level crossing in Turkey. The Oriental Railway Company's Alsancak-Aydın Main Line crossed with the Smyrna Cassaba Railway's Basmane-Afyon Main Line. Due to the layout of the tracks, the station was first named "Istravoz railway station" in 1866. "Istravoz" (from Greek σταυρóς) means Cross in Turkish. After the Republic of Turkey was formed in 1923, the station's name was changed to "Hilal" which means 'crescent', due to the majority of the city's population being Muslim. The Hilal subway station, which opened in 2000, is located adjacent to the railway station. When the electrification of the tracks around İzmir started in 2001, the station was closed. Aranyaprathet Railway Station is a railway station located in Aranyaprathet Subdistrict, Aranyaprathet District, Sa Kaeo, Thailand.

**Question:** Are both Ixia and Rhexia a plant genus?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
Hesperelaea is a plant genus with only one species, probably now extinct. Hesperelaea palmeri was found only on Guadalupe Island, a small island in the Pacific Ocean, part of the Mexican state of Baja California, about 400 km southwest of Ensenada. The last collection of the plant on the island was in 1875, so the species and the genus must now be presumed extinct. An intensive search for the plant in 2000 was unsuccessful. Falconeria is a monotypic plant genus in the family Euphorbiaceae, first described as a genus in 1839. The genus is sometimes included within the genus "Sapium". The sole species is Falconeria insignis. The plant is found from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka to Indochina, China (Hainan, Sichuan, Yunnan), Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia. Dierama pendulum, commonly known as fairy bell, hair bell and wedding bell, is a species of Iridaceae endemic to the Eastern Cape and first collected in 1772 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg near Essenbos on the Kromme River or Kromrivier which flows down the Langkloof. In 1845 the genus "Dierama" was established by Karl Koch (1809-1879) based on this specimen. Before that the plant had been placed in various genera including "Ixia", "Sparaxis" and "Watsonia". The species name has been misapplied to "D. inyangense", "D. densiflorum" and to "D. plowesii". Iris domestica, commonly known as leopard lily, blackberry lily, and leopard flower, is an ornamental plant in the Iridaceae family. In 2005, based on molecular DNA sequence evidence, "Belamcanda chinensis", the sole species in the genus "Belamcanda", was transferred to the genus "Iris" and renamed "Iris domestica". Other synonyms are "Epidendrum domesticum" L., "Vanilla domestica" (L.) Druce, "Belamcanda punctata" Moench, "Gemmingia chinensis" (L.) Kuntze, "Ixia chinensis" L., "Morea chinensis", and "Pardanthus chinensis" Ker Gawl. ) Rhexia is a plant genus of Melastomataceae (ca. 4500 species in 150 genera) family. "Rhexia" species are commonly called “meadow beauty” and 11 to 13 species of "Rhexia" have been recognized depending on different taxonomic treatments. The genus Ixia consists of a number of cormous plants native to South Africa from the Iridaceae family and Ixioideae subfamily. Some of them are known as the corn lily. Some distinctive traits include sword-like leaves and long wiry stems with star-shaped flowers. It usually prefers well-drained soil. The popular corn lily has specific, not very intense fragrance. It is often visited by many insects such as bees. The "Ixia" are also used sometimes as ornamental plants. Banksia sessilis, commonly known as parrot bush, is a species of shrub or tree in the plant genus "Banksia" in the family Proteaceae. It had been known as Dryandra sessilis until 2007, when the genus "Dryandra" was sunk into "Banksia". The Noongar peoples know the plant as Budjan or Butyak. Widespread throughout southwest Western Australia, it is found on sandy soils over laterite or limestone, often as an understorey plant in open forest, woodland or shrubland. Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to 6 m in height, it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow flowerheads. Flowering from winter through to late spring, it provides a key source of food—both the nectar and the insects it attracts—for honeyeaters in the cooler months, and species diversity is reduced in areas where there is little or no parrot bush occurring. Several species of honeyeater, some species of native bee, and the European honey bee seek out and consume the nectar, while the long-billed black cockatoo and Australian ringneck eat the seed. The life cycle of "Banksia sessilis" is adapted to regular bushfires. Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards, each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets. Phyllanthus is the largest genus in the flowering plant family Phyllanthaceae. Estimates of the number species in this genus vary widely, from 750 to 1200. "Phyllanthus" has a remarkable diversity of growth forms including annual and perennial herbs, shrubs, climbers, floating aquatics, and pachycaulous succulents. Some have flattened leaflike stems called cladodes. It has a wide variety of floral morphologies and chromosome numbers and has one of the widest range of pollen types of any seed plant genus. The flowering plant genus Ipheion (starflower, spring starflower) belongs to Allioideae subfamily of the Amaryllidaceae family. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families no longer recognize the genus, regarding it as a synonym of "Tristagma", although The Plant List accepts two species. Aldrovanda vesiculosa, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is the sole extant species in the flowering plant genus "Aldrovanda" of the family Droseraceae. The plant captures small aquatic invertebrates using traps similar to those of the Venus flytrap. The traps are arranged in whorls around a central, free-floating stem, giving rise to the common name. This is one of the few plant species capable of rapid movement.

**Question:** What foundation do scholars give for the likelihood of collaboration on a William Shakespeare Play written between 1588 and 1593?
**Answer:** linguistic analysis

**Context:**
Parivara (Pali for "accessory") is the third and last book of the Theravadin Vinaya Pitaka. It includes a summary and multiple analyses of the various rules identified in the Vinaya Pitaka's first two books, the Suttavibhanga and the Khandhaka, primarily for didactic purposes. As it includes a long list of teachers in Ceylon, even Theravada fundamentalists recognize that, at least in its present form, it is of late date. Scholars give it a late date, some suggesting it may be even later than the Fourth Council in Ceylon in the last century BCE, at which the Pali Canon was written down from oral tradition. Love's Labour's Won is a lost play attributed by contemporaries to William Shakespeare, written before 1598 and published by 1603, though no copies are known to have survived. Scholars dispute whether it is a true lost work, possibly a sequel to "Love's Labour's Lost", or an alternative title to a known Shakespeare play. Titus Andronicus is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1588 and 1593, probably in collaboration with George Peele. It is thought to be Shakespeare's first tragedy, and is often seen as his attempt to emulate the violent and bloody revenge plays of his contemporaries, which were extremely popular with audiences throughout the 16th century. The authorship of "Titus Andronicus" has been debated since the late 17th century. " Titus Andronicus", probably written between 1588 and 1593, appeared in three quarto editions from 1594 to 1601 with no named author. It was first published under William Shakespeare's name in the 1623 First Folio of his plays. However, as with some of his early and late plays, scholars have long surmised that Shakespeare might have collaborated with another playwright. Other plays have also been examined for evidence of co-authorship, but none has been as closely scrutinised or as consistently questioned than "Titus". The principal contender for the co-authorship is George Peele. Like most playwrights of his period, William Shakespeare did not always write alone. A number of his surviving plays are collaborative, or were revised by others after their original composition, although the exact number is open to debate. Some of the following attributions, such as "The Two Noble Kinsmen", have well-attested contemporary documentation; others, such as "Titus Andronicus", are dependent on linguistic analysis by modern scholars; recent work on computer analysis of textual style (word use, word and phrase patterns) has given reason to believe that parts of some of the plays ascribed to Shakespeare are actually by other writers. Although traditionally Titus Andronicus has been seen as one of Shakespeare's least respected plays, its fortunes have changed somewhat in the latter half of the twentieth century, with numerous scholars arguing that the play is more accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for. In particular, scholars have argued that the play is far more thematically complex than has traditionally been thought, and features profound insights into Ancient Rome, Elizabethan society, and the human condition. Such scholars tend to argue that these previously unacknowledged insights have only become apparent during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as only now has the ultraviolent content of the play achieved a sense of relevance. For example, in his 1987 edition of the play for the "Contemporary Shakespeare" series, A.L. Rowse writes; "in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed. Such is the horror of our own age, with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play, that it has ceased to be improbable." Similarly, director Julie Taymor, who staged a production Off-Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999, says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the most "relevant of Shakespeare's plays for the modern era;" She feels that the play has more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians; "it seems like a play written for today, it reeks of now." Because of this new found relevance, previously unrecognised thematic strands have thus come to the forefront. Revenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article "The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays," which characterizes revenge tragedy "as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself." Thomas Kyd's "The Spanish Tragedy" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage. However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including "Troas" (1559), "Thyestes" (1560), and "Hercules Furens" (1561). Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play "Gorbuduc" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to "The Spanish Tragedy"). Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's "Hamlet" (c.1599-1602) and "Titus Andronicus" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's "The Revenger's Tragedy" (c.1606). In music, the Romanian Minor scale or Ukrainian Dorian scale or altered Dorian scale is a musical scale or mode, "similar to the dorian mode, but with a tritone and variable sixth and seventh degrees". It is related to both the Freygish and Misheberak scales and is used in Jewish music, "predominant in klezmer bulgarish and doina (doyne)." "When the Ukrainian Dorian scale functions in the synagogue, it is a mode known as the "Mi sheberach" (May He Who Blessed) or "Av horachamim" (Compassionate Father). Arab and Greek scholars give other names to the scale: "Hijaz" and "Aulos", respectively." The Philadelphia Shakespeare Festival is an annual Shakespearean theatre festival in Philadelphia. Every year, The Festival produces two or three productions of Shakespeare's plays. Starting out as the Red Heel Theatre in 1989, and changing name and purpose in 1993, The Philadelphia Shakespeare Festival is now the region’s only theatre devoted entirely to Shakespeare’s works. In 2008/9, they engaged in intensive planning with the board of directors and cultural and community leaders and decided to re-brand and rename the company to better reflect their programming. The Philadelphia Shakespeare Theatre now has several programs for adults and students including a lecture series featuring world-renowned Shakespeare scholars, Shakespeare School Tour which also tours in schools, and a Classical Acting Academy providing early career actors with intense classical training culminating in a free summer Shakespeare play for the public. The Battle of Morella (14 August 1084×88), southwest of Tortosa, was fought between Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragon and Navarre, and Yusuf al-Mu'tamin, King of Zaragoza, while the former was engaged in a campaign of conquest against the latter. All surviving sources for the battle are either later by a generation or literary in character, and they are confused on the chronology and dating of the event. The encounter was a defeat for Sancho and sparked a brief reversal of fortunes in the Navarro-Aragonese "Reconquista". The Castilian hero, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, the Cid, was a general for al-Mu'tamin at the time. According to the Aragonese "Crónica de San Juan de la Peña" ("c".1370), Sancho later sought out the Cid, who had also defeated his father in the Battle of Graus (1063), and defeated him in the year 1088. However, the "Crónica" is the only source mentioning such an encounter and, as it was written three hundred years later, most leading scholars give no credence to this claim, which was probably intended to justify the prerogatives of Peter IV of the Crown of Aragon.

**Question:** What is one element of House dance where the dancer ripples his or her torso back and forth?
**Answer:** the jack

**Context:**
In mathematics, a bijection, bijective function or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function "f": "X" → "Y" is a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping of a set "X" to a set "Y". Solid solution strengthening is a type of alloying that can be used to improve the strength of a pure metal. The technique works by adding atoms of one element (the alloying element) to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the alloying element makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation of intermetallic compounds). In mathematics, more specifically in ring theory, a cyclic module is a module that is generated by one element over a ring. The concept is analogous to cyclic group, that is, a group that is generated by one element. A kayak roll (often referred to as an Eskimo roll) is the act of righting a capsized kayak by use of body motion and/or a paddle. Typically this is done by lifting the torso towards the surface, flicking the hips to right the kayak, and applying a small force by means of the paddle to assist the torso back over the boat. In mathematics, the field with one element is a suggestive name for an object that should behave similarly to a finite field with a single element, if such a field could exist. This object is denoted F, or, in a French–English pun, F. The name "field with one element" and the notation F are only suggestive, as there is no field with one element in classical abstract algebra. Instead, F refers to the idea that there should be a way to replace sets and operations, the traditional building blocks for abstract algebra, with other, more flexible objects. While there is still no field with a single element in these theories, there is a field-like object whose characteristic is one. In systems analysis, a one-to-one relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which one element of A may only be linked to one element of B, and vice versa. In mathematics, a trivial semigroup (a semigroup with one element) is a semigroup for which the cardinality of the underlying set is one. The number of distinct nonisomorphic semigroups with one element is one. If "S" = { "a" } is a semigroup with one element then the Cayley table of "S" is as given below: House dance is a social dance primarily danced to house music that has roots in the clubs of Chicago and of New York. The main elements of House dance include "Footwork", "Jacking", and "Lofting". House dance is often improvised and emphasizes fast and complex foot-oriented steps combined with fluid movements in the torso, as well as floor work. Jacking, or the jack, is a freestyle dance move in which the dancer ripples his or her torso back and forth in an undulating motion. House Dance International (“HDI”) is an annual street dance festival based in New York City that highlights the art forms of House dance, Vogue, Hustle, Waacking and Experimental, all of which are performed to house music or derivatives of electronic dance music. The three-day festival consists of a group choreography contest, freestyle competitions (i.e., "battles"), film screenings, seminars, workshops and parties. Established in 2007, HDI was the only event of its kind that exclusively focuses on the dance forms associated with house music culture (as compared to hip-hop dance forms such as b-boying, popping, locking, krumping, etc.).

Centered on the junction of Main and River Streets are a cluster of mainly brick buildings, built between 1880 and 1920, with several industrial properties just across the Missisquoi River to the south, whose waters provided the power for the industries that fueled the town's growth. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Franklin County State Airport (ICAO: KFSO, FAA LID: FSO) is a public airport located three miles (5 km) west of the central business district of Highgate, a town in Franklin County, Vermont, United States. It is owned by the State of Vermont. Vermont Route 139 (VT 139) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Vermont.

Richford is a town in Franklin County, Vermont, United States, located along the Canada–United States border. The population was 2,308 at the 2010 census. St. Albans City is the county seat of Franklin County, Vermont, in the United States. At the 2010 census, the city population was 6,918. St Albans City is surrounded by "St. Albans Town", which is incorporated separately from the city of St. Albans. The city and county are part of the Burlington metropolitan area, although the city is in Franklin County, north of the metro area's most populous county, Chittenden County. Rocky Mount Historic District is a national historic district located at Rocky Mount, Franklin County, Virginia. It encompasses 211 contributing buildings, 2 contributing sites (Mary Elizabeth Park and High Street Cemetery), 1 contributing site, and 2 contributing objects in the central business district and surround residential areas of Rocky Mount, county seat of Franklin County. It includes residential, commercial, institutional, and governmental buildings dated from the early- to mid-19th through early 20th centuries. Notable buildings include the Rakes Building (1929), N&W Freight Depot (c. 1907), Mount Pleasant (1828–1829), The Taliaffero Building (1827–1828), The Grove (1850), McCall House (c. 1907), Lodge Rooms (Colored) (c. 1900), Trinity Episcopal Church (c. 1874), Rocky Mount Presbyterian Church (c. 1880), Baptist Church (Colored) (c. 1907), N.

The New England town (generally referred to simply as a town in New England) is the basic unit of local government and local division of state authority in each of the six New England states and without a direct counterpart in most other U.S. states. New England towns overlay the entire area of a state, similar to civil townships in other states where they exist, but they are fully functioning municipal corporations, possessing powers similar to cities in other states. New Jersey's system of equally powerful townships, boroughs, towns, and cities is the system which is most similar to that of New England. New England towns are often governed by a town meeting legislative body. The great majority of municipal corporations in New England are based on the town model; statutory forms based on the concept of a compact populated place are uncommon, though they are prevalent elsewhere in the U.S. County government in New England states is typically weak at best, and in some states nonexistent. Connecticut, for example, has no county governments, The Franklin County Government Center is a government complex of Franklin County, Ohio in Columbus, Ohio. The tallest building in the complex is the 27-floor, 464 ft tall Franklin County Courthouse at 373 South High Street. It is the seventh tallest building in Columbus.

**Question:** The castle where "Spook Squad" was filmed is in what part of Scotland?
**Answer:** Aberdeenshire, Scotland

**Context:**
Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, from its position on the Castle Rock. Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1100-year-old history, giving it a claim to having been "the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world". Balloch Castle is an early 19th-century country house situated at the southern tip of Loch Lomond, in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Balloch was a property of the Lennox family from the 11th century, and the old castle was built in the 13th century. In the 19th century the estate was purchased by John Buchanan of Ardoch, who demolished the ruins of the old castle and erected the present building. The Tudor Gothic architecture is the work of Robert Lugar. In 1915 Balloch was bought by Glasgow City Corporation, and has been leased by West Dunbartonshire Council since 1975. The estate was designated as a country park in 1980, and since 2002 has been part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. Although the house has been periodically used for visitor facilities and council offices, it is now included on the Buildings at Risk Register. Balloch Castle is a category A listed building, and the estate is included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. Kinloch Castle (Scottish Gaelic: "Caisteal Cheann Locha" ) is a late Victorian mansion located on the Isle of Rùm, one of the Small Isles off the west coast of Scotland. It was built as a private residence for Sir George Bullough, a textile tycoon from Lancashire whose father bought Rùm as his summer residence and shooting estate. Construction began in 1897, and was completed in 1900. Built as a luxurious retreat, Kinloch Castle has since declined. The castle and island are now owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, and part of the castle operates as a hostel. The Kinloch Castle Friends Association was established in 1996 to secure the long-term future of the building. Loch Leven Castle is a ruined castle on an island in Loch Leven, in the Perth and Kinross local authority area of Scotland. Possibly built around 1300, the castle was the location of military action during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357). In the latter part of the 14th century, the castle was granted by his uncle to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, and remained in Douglas' hands for the next 300 years. Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned here in 1567–1568, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler's family. In 1588, the Queen's gaoler inherited the title Earl of Morton, and moved away from the castle. It was bought, in 1675, by Sir William Bruce, who used the castle as a focal point in his garden; it was never again used as a residence. Ardencaple Castle, also known as Ardincaple Castle, and sometimes referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about 1 smi from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, perched on the edge of a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde. The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century, and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century. Today, that sole remaining tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Because of its use as a lighthouse the tower has been called Ardencaple Castle Light. Spook Squad is a British children's television gameshow created by BBC Scotland. It ran on CBBC's section BBC1 and BBC2 from 6 January 2004, to 30 March 2004. The gameshow featured three children contestants entering a haunted castle in Scotland to assist Professor MacAbre in hunting ghosts before they reach their "death day" and gain superpowers. The show was filmed in Fyvie Castle. Crail Castle was a castle that was located in Crail, Fife, Scotland. Crail became a Royal Burgh in the 12th century. The castle was frequented by King David I of Scotland during his reign in the 12th century. Ada de Warenne obtained Crail as part of her marriage settlement with Prince Henry of Scotland. King Robert I of Scotland reconfirmed Crail's burgh status in 1306 and confirmed the constabulary of the castle to Lawrence de Weirmerstoun in 1310. By 1563 the castle had become ruinous. The castle was sited above the harbour. No remains above ground are visible. Castle Semple (previously Castletoun) is a former mansion house located in Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is situated near the eastern end of Castle Semple Loch, within Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park. Erected, or more probably rebuilt, by John Sempill, 1st Lord Sempill, he changed its name from Castletoun to Castle-Semple. In Willem Blaeu's "Atlas Maior", published in 1654, the castle is represented by a mark denoting the largest size of castles. In George Crawford's "History of Renfrewshire" (1710), he noted, ""Upon the brink of the loch stands the castle of Sempill, the principal messuage of a fair lordship of the same denomination, which consists of a large court, part of which seems to be a very ancient building, adorned with pleasant orchards and gardens."" According to Gardner, Castleton was built in 1492-3, but Millar states that it was built closer to 1550, as a successor to Elliston Castle. Tilquhillie Castle is a castle near Banchory in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. A Category A listed building, the castle formally formed part of the lands of Arbroath Abbey. Historic Environment Scotland's listed-building report from 1972 described the castle thus: Fyvie Castle is a castle in the village of Fyvie, near Turriff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

**Question:** Are both Grapico and Izze artificially flavored soft drinks?
**Answer:** no

**Context:**
Vault was a sweetened carbonated beverage that was released by The Coca-Cola Company in June 2005 and marketed until December 2011. It was touted as an artificially flavored hybrid energy drink. Coca-Cola was marketing Vault as a combination with the slogan "Drinks like a soda, kicks like an energy drink," as well as "The Taste. The Quench. The Kick." "Get it done, and then some," "Chug & Charge," and "Get to it!" Sunkist is a brand of primarily orange flavored soft drinks launched in 1979. Izze (pronounced iz-ee) is the brand name of a line of carbonated juice drinks produced by the IZZE Beverage Company in Boulder, Colorado, which is owned by PepsiCo. The drinks consist of 70% fruit juice from concentrate, and 30% seltzer water. Izze is an all-natural, no-preservatives-added fruit soda. A soda fountain is a device that dispenses carbonated soft drinks, called fountain drinks. They can be found in restaurants, concession stands and other locations such as convenience stores. The device combines flavored syrup or syrup concentrate and carbon dioxide with chilled and purified water to make soft drinks, either manually, or in a vending machine which is essentially an automated soda fountain that is operated using a soda gun. Today, the syrup often is pumped from a special container called a bag-in-box (BIB). Grapico is a caffeine-free, artificially flavored carbonated soft drink with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States. When introduced in 1916, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it did not. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman's Sons sold the Grapico business to New Orleans business Pan American Manufacturing Co. Pan American continued J. Grossman's Sons' improper practice of implying that Grapico contained real grape juice and lost the right to use the word "Grapico" to designate their artificial grape drink in 1929. National Beverage Corp. is an American beverage developer, manufacturer, and distributor based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, focused on flavored soft drinks. National Beverage Corp. is ranked by "Beverage Digest" as the fifth-largest soft drink company in the United States. The Cott Corporation is a supplier of private label carbonated soft drinks distributing to the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Europe. In addition to producing private-label beverages for retailers, Cott also has portfolio of its own brands, including Cott, RC (excluding the United States, where it is part of Dr Pepper Snapple Group), Ben Shaws, Stars & Stripes, Vintage and Vess soft drinks, ready-to-drink teas, sparkling and flavoured waters, sports and energy drinks, juice drinks and smoothies. Newer Cott brands include Orient Emporium, GL-7, Red Rain Energy and After Shock Energy. This is a list of soft drinks in order of the brand's country of origin. A soft drink is a beverage that typically contains water (often, but not always, carbonated water), usually a sweetener and usually a flavoring agent. The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks) or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives and other ingredients. Crazy Cow was a breakfast cereal produced by General Mills during the 1970s. The cereal was somewhat of a novelty item in that it had an unusual trait. The round, multi-grain cereal pellets were coated with an excipient of a drink mix. When milk was added, it would dissolve the powdered coating, and the resultant mixture would resemble in sight, smell, and taste, a flavored milk. Crazy Cow came in two flavors, chocolate and strawberry. As the box indicated, these were just flavors; no actual chocolate or strawberries were in the ingredients. The box always contained the disclaimer "artificially flavored" or "chocolate flavored". Mamba Fruit Chews are a brand of fruit chew candies, made in Germany by August Storck KG. They are artificially flavored in strawberry, orange, lemon, and raspberry. They are vegan. Mamba was launched in 1953 in packs of six. They are most often sold in packages of 18 or 24 soft chews and the flavors within each package are selected at random.

**Question:** Was the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower [Met Life Tower] or the 15 Hudson Yards building designed by the firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons?
**Answer:** The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower

**Context:**
The Supreme Life Building is a historic insurance building located at 3501 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier. The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States. Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community. The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s. Napoleon Eugene Charles Henry LeBrun (January 2, 1821 – July 9, 1901) was an American architect known for several notable Philadelphia churches, in particular St. Augustine's Church on Fourth Street and the Cathedral-Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul on Logan Square. He also designed the Academy of Music at Broad and Locust Streets. LeBrun later moved to New York City, where he established the firm Napoleon LeBrun & Sons, which designed numerous notable buildings. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, colloquially known as the Met Life Tower, is a landmark skyscraper located on Madison Avenue near the intersection with East 23rd Street, across from Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City. Designed by the architectural firm of Napoleon LeBrun & Sons and built by the Hedden Construction Company, the tower is modeled after the Campanile in Venice, Italy. The hotel located in the clock tower portion of the building has the address 5 Madison Avenue, while the office building covering the rest of the block, occupied primarily by Credit Suisse, is referred to as 1 Madison Avenue. Some of the finest buildings in New Jersey, New York City, and other large eastern cities were built by the Hedden Construction Company, one of the largest construction companies operating in Newark in the very early 1900s. Among the most notable is the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower located at One Madison Avenue in New York, NY. The tower was the world's tallest building from 1909 to 1913 and home to the Hedden Construction Company's main offices located on the 36th and 37th floors. During this prosperous period over $40,000,000 in construction contracts and payments were collected by the firm. 15 Hudson Yards is a residential building currently under construction on Manhattan's West Side. Located in Chelsea near Hell's Kitchen Penn Station area, the building is a part of the Hudson Yards project, a plan to redevelop the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's West Side Yards. The tower started construction on December 4, 2014. The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper. Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name "Flatiron" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron. Protective Life Corporation is a financial service holding company in Birmingham, Alabama. The company’s primary subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company, was established in 1907 and now markets its products and services in all 50 states. As of December 31, 2016, the corporation had more than 2,700 employees, annual revenues of $4.48 billion and assets of $75 billion. In addition to Protective Life Insurance Company, Protective Life Corporation's subsidiaries include West Coast Life Insurance Company, MONY Life Insurance Company, Protective Life And Annuity Insurance Company, ProEquities Inc./Protective Securities, and Lyndon Property Insurance Company. Physicians Mutual is a privately held insurance company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, that consists of Physicians Mutual Insurance Company and Physicians Life Insurance Company. Founded as Physicians Mutual Insurance Company in 1902 by Edwin E. Elliott, Physicians Mutual began by selling health insurance to medical professionals. Policies were offered to the general public starting in 1962, and by 1970 the company expanded into life insurance when it founded Physicians Life Insurance Company. Today the company offers a variety of insurance products, annuities, Medicare, Medigap, Medicare Supplement, Term Life Insurance, Whole Life Insurance, Cancer and funeral pre-planning services. It holds over US$3 billion in assets and employs over one thousand people. Robert A. Reed is chief executive officer and president. The Lyceum Theatre was a theatre in New York City located on Fourth Avenue, now Park Avenue South, between 23rd and 24th Streets in Manhattan. It was built in 1885 and operated until 1902, when it was torn down to make way for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. It was replaced by a new Lyceum Theatre on 45th Street. For most of its existence, the theatre was home to Daniel Frohman’s Lyceum Theatre Stock Company, which presented many important plays and actors of the day. The Metropolitan Life North Building, now known as Eleven Madison, is a 30-story art deco skyscraper on Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City, at 11-25 Madison Avenue.

**Question:** In what year was the Sayrevill, New Jersey rock band that Frankie LaRocka played drums for formed?
**Answer:** 1983

**Context:**
The Rats were an American garage punk band from Portland, Oregon, formed by Fred Cole previously of the garage rock band, The Lollipop Shoppe. Cole played guitar and sang, his wife, "Toody" played bass and sang, and initially Rod Rat played drums. Their sound was a raw mix of punk rock with occasional country touches. Their self-titled debut album appeared on Cole's Whizeagle label in 1980. Soon after, Rod Rat left the band, though he guested on the 1981 follow-up "Intermittent Signals" before his death by suicide. (Prior to his suicide Rod Rat (aka Rod Hibbert) also played drums in 1980-81 for Portland power pop band Domino Theory). Sam Henry, formerly of the Wipers, played drums on this LP but left to join another Portland band, Napalm Beach. Louis Samora was on the drum throne for the 1983 album "In a Desperate Red", still on Whizeagle. Samora left in 1984 to concentrate on his rockabilly band, The Jackals. The band broke up, but Bill Barker of Profile Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia convinced the band to reunite for a single. It appeared under the band name The Desperate Edge later in 1984. Soon after, Cole assembled a country band, Western Front, and he and Toody later reunited in Dead Moon. The Rats' records have long been out of print and sell for high prices on eBay. In 2008, Portland's Mississippi Records reissued the first album on vinyl. Bon Jovi is an American rock band from Sayreville, New Jersey. Formed in 1983, Bon Jovi consists of lead singer and namesake Jon Bon Jovi, pianist and keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, lead guitarist Phil X, and bassist Hugh McDonald. The band's lineup has remained mostly static during its history, with the only exceptions being the 1994 dismissal of bass player Alec John Such, who was unofficially replaced by Hugh McDonald, and the departure of longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora in 2013. Phil X and McDonald both became official members in 2016. A Date with the Smithereens is the fifth album by the New Jersey rock band The Smithereens, released in 1994. It is seen as a stylistic departure by the band, as "A Date" is mainly influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, while previous albums have leaned more towards straightforward pop rock. The title is meant to be ironic as nearly all songs on the album are hate-inspired. The Rosebuds are an indie rock band from Raleigh, North Carolina, United States. (Not to be confused with the vocal group of the same name who recorded for George Goldner's Gee Records in the 1950s.) Its current members are Ivan Howard (vocals/guitar/drums/bass/keyboards/programming) and Kelly Crisp (vocals/keyboard/drums/guitar/accordion). Billy Alphin had played drums on the album "The Rosebuds Make Out", Wes Phillips played drums on the E.P."Unwind", Lee Waters played drums on the record "Birds Make Good Neighbors", and Matt McCaughan played the drums on "Night of the Furies", "Life Like" and "Loud Planes Fly Low." Rob Lackey was behind the drum kit during the taping of "The Rosebuds Live at the Cats Cradle", a charity only recording sold at "cytunes.org" to help fight for the prevention of cancer, as well as on the track "Second Birds of Paradise" on "Loud Planes Fly Low." The Baby Namboos were a 1990s British trip hop band. One of their members, Mark Porter, is the cousin of Tricky, who produced some tracks on their debut album. Their song "Late Night Antics" inspired a New Jersey rock band to call themselves Mister Behavior, a persona mentioned in the song. The Royal Teens was a New Jersey rock and roll band that formed in 1956, which was composed of Bob Gaudio on piano, Tom Austin on drums, Billy Dalton on guitar, and Billy Crandall on saxophone. The group is best known for its single "Short Shorts," which was a #3 hit in the United States in 1958. The follow-up single, 1959's "Believe Me," hit #26. They never recorded an album, and broke up in 1965. Frankie LaRocka (April 17, 1954 – May 12, 2005), born Frank LaRocca, was an American rock musician and producer. He was a member of Scandal, playing drums on their debut EP, and, at various stages, played the drums with Bon Jovi, David Johansen, Bryan Adams, and John Waite. In the 1990s, he became an A&R man and producer with his most notable work being with the Spin Doctors on their breakthrough album "Pocket Full of Kryptonite". The Del-Aires were a Paterson, New Jersey rock band of the 1960s. They were featured as themselves in Del Tenney's 1964 B-movie beach party film, "The Horror of Party Beach." For the film, Gary Robert Jones and Ronnie Linares wrote one song together, "Drag," and one song each: "Wigglin' Wobblin'" (Jones) and "Elaine" (Linares). The Del-Aires performed all six songs in the film, which included "Joy Ride", "The Zombie Stomp" and "You Are Not a Summer Love." Following his stint with the Del-Aires, saxophonist/guitarist/keyboardist Bobby Osborne was a member of the band Gas Mask, perhaps best known for having their first (and only) album, "Their First Album," produced by Teo Macero. Sean Aaberg was born in Oakland, California. He is the son of Philip Aaberg and LouAnn Lucke. He grew up in Oakland, attending Bishop O'Dowd High School and briefly attended the California College of the Arts. As a kid, he liked "anything weird, nasty and old", including cheap magazines and bought thousands of them, he said in an interview. He and his friends read "Mad", drew comics, liked to listen to Cheech and Chong and the Ramones on the Dr. Demento show, and later discovered the Church of the Subgenius. He admired the movies of Ralph Bakshi. The interviewer noted that Aaberg writes in ALL CAPS. Sean founded and played drums in the Oakland-based Hardcore Punk band The Masked Men, played drums for Baltimore-based Anarcho Punk band A//Political and founded and played drums for Eugene-based Rock and Roll band The Latrines. Live at the Court: Greatest Hits and More is the ninth album from New Jersey rock band The Smithereens. It was recorded live at the Court Tavern in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

**Question:** In what year did the playwright who wrote "The City Heiress" die?
**Answer:** 1689

**Context:**
Die glückliche Hand ("The Hand of Fate"), Op. 18, is a "Drama mit Musik" ("drama with music") by Arnold Schoenberg in four scenes. It was composed between 1910 and 1913. Like "Erwartung", composed a year earlier, it was heavily influenced by Otto Weininger's book "Sex and Character". Unlike "Erwartung", Schoenberg wrote the libretto for "Die glückliche Hand" himself. The first performance took place in Vienna on 24 October 1924. The underlying message of the piece is the idea that man continues to repeatedly make the same mistakes, and the plot is developed from events in Schoenberg’s personal life. The Exception and the Rule (in German Die Ausnahme und die Regel) is a short play by German playwright Bertolt Brecht and is one of several "Lehrstücke" (Teaching plays) he wrote around 1929/30. The objective of Brecht's Lehrstücke was that they be taken on tour and performed in schools or in factories to educate the masses about socialist politics. The Heiress is a comedy play by the British playwright and soldier John Burgoyne. The play debuted at the Drury Lane Theatre on 14 January 1786. It concerns the engagement of Lord Gayville to Miss Alscrip, a fashionable woman he believes to be an heiress. Gayville later discovers that the woman who really stands to inherit the fortune is his true love Miss Clifford. The play was an enormous success, running for 31 performances in its initial season and being revived again the following year. The play was initially anonymous, but Burgoyne was soon widely reported to be the author and he acknowledged this after the play's debut. The City Heiress is a play by Aphra Behn produced in 1682. The play conforms to the general rules of Restoration comedy, but it also keeps Behn's own highly Royalist political point of view. Aphra Behn ( ; 14 December 1640? (baptismal date)–16 April 1689) was a British playwright, poet, translator and fiction writer from the Restoration era. As one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, she broke cultural barriers and served as a literary role model for later generations of women authors. Rising from obscurity, she came to the notice of Charles II, who employed her as a spy in Antwerp. Upon her return to London and a probable Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action film and the third in the "Die Hard" film series. It was co-produced and directed by John McTiernan (who directed "Die Hard"), written by Jonathan Hensleigh, and stars Bruce Willis as New York City Police Department Lieutenant John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, and Jeremy Irons as Simon Gruber. It was released on May 19, 1995, five years after "Die Hard 2", becoming the highest-grossing film at the worldwide box-office that year, but received mixed reviews. It was followed by "Live Free or Die Hard" and "A Good Day to Die Hard" in 2007 and 2013, respectively. "Reminiscence of Marie A." or "Memory of Marie A." (German: ""Erinnerung an die Marie A."") is a 1920 poem by German poet and playwright Bertold Brecht (1889-1956) that was first published in his collection "Die Hauspostille" (1927). Brecht wrote the poem in his notebook on 21 February 1920 on a train to Berlin. The poem is a reminiscence of time spent with a former lover and a kiss beneath a plum tree remembered only because of the memory of a passing white cloud. Dionigi joined the Order of Hermits at the Augustinian monastery in Borgo San Sepolcro at an early age. The convent had been founded in 1281 and was located in the valley of Spoleto. He was sent to study theology at the Sorbonne in Paris and graduated "baccalaureus sententiarius" during the academic year 1317-18. About 1324 he obtained a doctorate in theology and was a professor at Borgo San Sorbonne through 1328. While in Paris, he practised astrology, and predicted the unexpected death of Castruccio Castracani. Giovanni Villani wrote him with the latest news from Italy, deeply concerned about what Castracani and Emperor Louis the Bavarian were about to do; Dionigi wrote back, saying that none of those things would happen, because Castracani was about to die — and he did. Joan Cooper (November 10, 1931, Berkeley, California – September 20, 2014, Seattle, Washington), known by her pen name, J. California Cooper, was an American playwright and author. She wrote 17 plays and was named Black Playwright of the Year in 1978 for her play "Strangers". Franz Friedrich Richard Genée (February 7, 1823 – June 15, 1895) was a Prussian born Austrian librettist, playwright, and composer. He is most famous for the libretto of "Die Fledermaus", Johann Strauss II's most famous operetta. He co-wrote the libretto without having met top-billed librettist Karl Haffner, who constructed the new story based on a play by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, which was considered too shocking to perform outside Paris. Genée, however, wrote the operetta's actual text and drew nothing from Haffner beyond the names of the characters.

**Context:**
The Carnival in Rio de Janeiro (Portuguese: Carnaval) is a festival held every year before Lent and considered the biggest carnival in the world with 2 million people per day on the streets. The first festivals of Rio date back to 1723. The Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba Império Serrano is a samba school of the city of Rio de Janeiro, that was created on March 23 of 1947 after a disagreement of the extinct samba school Prazer da Serrinha. It was nine times champion of the Carnaval and can be considered one of the most traditional schools of the samba of the city. One of the principal vainglories of its members is the open democracy of the school, established in the school's foundation. Its history is normally confused with the history of the Morro da Serrinha, despite its headquarters being in Avenida Ministro Edgard Romero near the Estação Mercadão de Madureira, but in the same neighborhood: Madureira. Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba Acadêmicos do Salgueiro, popularly known simply as Salgueiro is a popular samba school from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was established on March 5, 1953 from the merger of Morro do Salgueiro's two samba schools called Azul e Branco do Salgueiro ("Salgueiro's Blue and White") and Depois Eu Digo ("I'll Say it Later"), which then merged again with Unidos do Salgueiro.

Castor was also very involved in the Brazilian Carnival and in soccer—he was the major sponsor of Bangu Atlético Clube and even called the "owner of Bangu", and he was also the patron of samba school Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel. He also helped found in 1984 the Liga Independente das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro, which has run the Rio de Janeiro Carnival ever since and has served as the legal cover for the "jogo do bicho cartel". A samba school (Portuguese: "Escola de samba" ) is a dancing club or school. They practise and often perform in huge square-compounds ("quadras de samba") devoted to practising and exhibiting samba, an African-Brazilian dance. The schools (which are structured more like a guild than a school in the usual sense) have a strong community basis and are traditionally associated with a particular neighborhood. They are often seen to affirm the cultural validity of the Afro-Brazilian heritage in contrast to the mainstream education system. and have evolved often in contrast to authoritarian development. The phrase "escola de samba" is popularly held to derive from the schoolyard location of the first group's early rehearsals. In Rio de Janeiro especially, they are mostly associated with particular shanty towns ("favela") . Samba and the samba school can be deeply interwoven with the daily lives of the shanty-town dwellers. Throughout the year the samba schools have various happenings and events, most important of which are rehearsals for the main event which is the yearly carnival parade. Each of the main schools spend many months each year designing the theme, holding a competition for their song, building the floats and rehearsing. It is overseen by a "carnavalesco" or carnival director. From 2005, some fourteen of the top samba schools in Rio have used a specially designed warehouse complex, the size of ten football pitches, called Samba City (Cidade do Samba) to build and house the elaborate floats. Each school's parade may consist of about 3,000 performers or more, and the preparations, especially producing the many different costumes, provide work for thousands of the poorest in Brazilian society. The resulting competition is a major economic and media event, with tens of thousands in the live audience and screened live to millions across South America.

**Question:** The Schumann–Runge bands are named for at least one German what?
**Answer:** mathematician

**Context:**
In complex analysis, Runge's theorem (also known as Runge's approximation theorem) is named after the German mathematician Carl Runge who first proved it in the year 1885. It states the following: This is a complete list of all of New Zealand's national cricket captains at official international level. As such it includes details of all the men who have captained at least one Test match or One Day International, all boys who have captained in at least one Youth Test or Youth ODI, and all women who have captained at least one women's Test match or women's one-day international. New Zealand became a full member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) on 31 May 1926 at the same time as India were made up to full membership, and their first-class cricket matches against other full member nations since that date have been Tests. Max Coyne was a young man who ran messages through Bordeaux for the French Resistance during the Second World War. One day he was stopped by German soldiers whilst carrying messages. He managed to steal a gun and shoot one German, injuring him. The soldiers gave chase, caught and shot Max. He was seventeen years old. There is now a street in Bordeaux named after Max (rue Max Coyne, 33100). Da Crime Posse was one well-known group in the genre of Oriental Hip Hop in Germany. The group was composed of two Turkish people (M.Ali and InceEfe), one German person (Olcay/Ole), and one Cuban person (Babalu). In his essay addressing the development of hip-hop in Germany, author Timothy S. Brown suggests that many musical groups in Germany are adopting a sort of “symbolic ethnicity” which asserts that one “does not necessarily have to be Turkish” to assume the Turkish identity. Furthermore, a scholar named Dietmar Elfein has cited Da Crime Posse as an example of how the “Turkish identity proposed is a mythological one” in the sense that one did not necessarily have to be Turkish to assume this symbolic ethnicity. Perhaps one of the most important musical collaborations that Da Crime Posse has taken part in has been that with Karakan and Erci E. Cina-i Sebeke (of Da Crime Posse) was the individual who met fellow Turkish hip-hop artists Karakan and Erci-E and spurred their musical collaboration. Together, they established the legendary group Cartel and released a compilation album in 1995. The only single from their self-titled album, composed by Big Porno Ahmet, brought the biggest success in the history of Turkish hip-hop. With this unexpected success, they achieved Gold and Platinum status (plus many more awards) by selling more than 2,250,000 copies. Carl David Tolmé Runge (] ; 30 August 1856 – 3 January 1927) was a German mathematician, physicist, and spectroscopist. The Combat Commander's Kagitingan (K) Badge is awarded by the Commanding General, PA to PA officers and enlisted personnel who have commanded combat and combat support units for at least one cumulative year; all other PA military personnel who have rendered at least one cumulative year of combat duty regardless of their assignment, including those engaged in combat service support operations. Corresponding honorary badges may maybe awarded to all other personnel from the PAF, PN, and PMC who have been assigned to units engaged in combat, combat support, combat support operations for at least one cumulative year, regardless of duty assignment or position. The Schumann–Runge bands are a set of absorption bands of molecular oxygen that occur at wavelengths between 176 and 192.6 nanometres. The bands are named for Victor Schumann and Carl Runge. HMS "Beagle" was a B-class destroyer built for the Royal Navy (RN) around 1930. Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936. During World War II, the ship spent the bulk of the war on escort duty, participating in the Norwegian Campaign, the Battle of the Atlantic, Operation Torch, the Russian Convoys, and in the Normandy landings before accepting the surrender of the German garrison of the Channel Islands the day after the formal German surrender on 9 May together with another ship. One exception to this pattern was when she helped to evacuate British soldiers and civilians during the Battle of France in 1940. During the war, "Beagle" assisted in sinking one German submarine and claimed to have shot down two German aircraft. Redundant after the war, she was broken up for scrap in 1946. Mollie's Nipple or Molly's Nipple is the name given to as many as seven peaks, at least one butte, at least one well, and some other geological features in Utah. Some sources claim there are eleven geological features in Utah that bear this name. At least some of those names are attributed to John Kitchen – a pioneer of an early exploration of Utah, who named them to commemorate a nipple of his wife (or his bride according to some sources) Molly. Robert Schumann in Three Pieces is the collective title given to three works, composed for the "Avenue A" ensemble by the British composer, Matthew King. Together, they constitute a musical portrait of the German Romantic composer, Robert Schumann. The first piece, entitled "Ash on the Ground" is a passacaglia in which various compositions by Schumann are quoted; the second piece, entitled "Love in a Life" has a soprano soloist, and is a miniature song cycle to texts by Robert Schumann himself, along with poems by Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It has been described, by one critic, as "rich and sumptuous, with some spine-tingling moments" the third piece, entitled "Night Phantoms and Rocking Horses" is a rapid musical survey of Schumann's piano music at a furious galloping tempo. The work ends with fragments of celeste and percussion sounding like a wound-down music box.

**Answer:** Mitsubishi

**Context:**
The Prince Motor Company was a Japanese automobile manufacturer from 1952 until its merger with Nissan in 1966. Prince began as the Tachikawa Aircraft Company, a manufacturer of various airplanes for the Japanese Army in World War II, e.g., the Ki-36, Ki-55 and Ki-74. Tachikawa Aircraft Company was dissolved after the war and the company took the name Fuji Precision Industries. It diversified into automobiles, producing an electric car, the Tama, in 1946, named for the region the company originated in, Tama, using the Ohta series PC/PD platform. The company changed its name to Prince in 1952 to honor Prince Akihito's formal investiture as Crown Prince. In 1954 they changed their name back to Fuji Precision Industries, and in 1961 changed the name back again to Prince Motor Company. In 1966, they became part of Nissan, while the Prince organization remained in existence inside Nissan, as "Nissan Prince Store" in Japan until Nissan consolidated the Prince dealership network into "Nissan Blue Stage" in 1999. The Nissan Cefiro is a luxury car that was produced by the Japanese automobile manufacture Nissan Motors. Introduced to Japan in 1988 as the A31 series four-door sedan, and exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called "Nissan Satio Store", the Cefiro initially shared its basic rear-wheel drive chassis with the Nissan Laurel (C33), (F31), and the Nissan Skyline (R32). After production of the A31 stopped, the Cefiro dropped its sporting pretensions and essentially saw the standalone Cefiro model deleted from the lineup. This came with the introduction of the A32 and A33 Maxima, which took on the Cefiro nameplace in the Japanese domestic market although it bore no mechanical relation to the A31. The A32 and A33 closely follow the lineage of the J30 Maxima which was produced at the same time as the A31 Cefiro. The second generation (A32) and third (A33) generation Cefiro saw the switching to the front-wheel drive layout with a V6 engine. In Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand and Australia, the A32 and A33 series models were sold new as the Nissan Maxima. It is also badge engineered as the Renault Samsung SM5.

In 2009 a controlling interest in Bashneft was acquired for $2 billion by Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov and placed in his holding company, Sistema, but in July 2014 he was jailed and 72% of Sistema's interest in Bashneft seized by the Russian government. Following seizure of the company in December 2014 Yevtushenkov was released from jail, "charges not proven," but Ural Rakhimov was reported to have fled the country. It is one of the larger producers of oil products in the country. The company operates 140 oil and natural gas fields in Russia and has an annual oil production of 16 million tonnes.

**Question:** Are Control Room and Meeting Resistance both documentary films that involve Iraq?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
Control Room is a 2004 documentary film about Al Jazeera and its relations with the US Central Command (CENTCOM), as well as the other news organizations that covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Made by Egyptian-American filmmaker Jehane Noujaim, the film was distributed by Magnolia Pictures (owned by 2929 Entertainment). In sound recording, talkback refers to the intercom system used in recording studios and production control rooms (PCR) in television studios to enable personnel to communicate with people in the recording area or booth. While the control room can hear the person in the booth over the studio microphones, the person in the booth hears the control room over a PA, monitor speaker, in their headphones or Interruptible feedback (IFB) earpiece. Take numbers, reference data, and sometimes count-ins or remarks are also "stamped" onto recordings through talkback, similar to a clapperboard. The cargo control room, CCR, or cargo office of a tankship is where the person in charge (PIC) can monitor and control the loading and unloading of the ship's liquid cargo. Prevalent on automated vessels, the CCR may be in its own room, or located on the ship's bridge. Among other things, the equipment in the CCR may allow the person in charge to control cargo and stripping pumps, control and monitor valve positions, and monitor cargo tank liquid levels. A control room, operations center, or operations control center (OCC) is a room serving as a central space where a large physical facility or physically dispersed service can be monitored and controlled. A control room will often be part of a larger command center. Production control is the activity of monitoring and controlling any particular production or operation. Production control is often run from a specific control room or operations room. With inventory control and quality control, production control is one of the key functions of operations management. Master control is the technical hub of a broadcast operation common among most over-the-air television stations and television networks. It is distinct from a production control room (PCR) in television studios where the activities such as switching from camera to camera are coordinated. It is also vastly different from the studio where the talent are located. A transmission control room (TCR) is usually smaller in size and is a scaled down version of centralcasting. A distributed control system (DCS) is a computerised control system for a process or plant usually with a large number of control loops, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is central operator supervisory control. This is in contrast to non-distributed control systems that use centralised controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer. The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localising control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision. The production control room or studio control room (SCR) is the place in a television studio in which the composition of the outgoing program takes place. An SCR is also often the acronym for the Satellite Control Room, from here TV feeds are sent to & received from the local Satellite used by the TV station Transmission control room (TCR) or ' transmission suite' , or ' Tx room' , or "presentation" is a room at broadcast facilities and television stations around the world. Compared to a Master Control Room, it is usually smaller in size and is a scaled-down version of centralcasting. The TX Room or Presentation suite are staffed 24x7 by Presentation Coordinators and Tape Operators and is fitted out with video play out systems often using server based broadcast automation. Meeting Resistance is a 2007 documentary film about the Iraq War. The film presents the views of eleven Iraqi resistance fighters in the Adhamiyah neighborhood of Baghdad. The film was directed by journalists Molly Bingham (United States) and Steve Connors (UK).

**Question:** What is the name the French give to the war during which the Prussians occupied the Pavillon du Butard?
**Answer:** War of 1870

**Context:**
Jean-François Du Cheyron, chevalier du Pavillon (29 September 1730 – 12 April 1782) was a French naval tactician and "Capitaine du vaisseau", hero of the American Revolutionary War. He is considered one of the principal creators of naval communications before the era of radio.

The Battle of Chotusitz, or Chotusice, sometimes called the Battle of Czaslau, was fought on May 17, 1742, in Bohemia between the Austrians under Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine and the Prussians under Frederick the Great. The battle was a part of the War of the Austrian Succession, sometimes referred to as the First Silesian War. The armies were about equal at 28,000 to 30,000 each, with the Prussians having about 2,000 more infantry and the Austrians some 2,000 more cavalry. The Austrians were attempting to retake occupied Prague and the Prussians were trying to block them from accomplishing that. The battle of Chotusitz was especially notable in that it was the only major battle started by the Austrians during this war.

The Hôtel de Rambouillet was the Paris residence of Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet, "Madame de Rambouillet", who ran a renowned literary salon there from 1620 until 1648. Formerly the Hôtel de Pisani, it was situated in the "rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre", in a former quarter of Paris (demolished at the beginning of the 19th century) between the Louvre and Tuileries palaces, near the then much smaller "Place du Carrousel", in the area of what was to become the "Pavillon Turgot" of the Louvre Museum. (This Hôtel de Rambouillet, formerly Hôtel de Pisani, should not be confused with the one by same name situated on "Rue Saint-Honoré", which belonged to the d'Angennes family who sold it in December 1602, and on which site Cardinal Richelieu began building his Palais-Cardinal in 1624.) The Battle of Kaiserslautern (23 May 1794) saw an army from the Kingdom of Prussia and Electoral Saxony led by Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf fall upon a single French Republican division under Jean-Jacques Ambert from the "Army of the Moselle". The Prussians tried to surround their outnumbered adversaries but most of the French evaded capture. Nevertheless, Möllendorf's troops inflicted casualties on the French in the ratio of nine-to-one and occupied Kaiserslautern. While the Prussians won this triumph on an unimportant front, the French armies soon began winning decisive victories in Belgium and the Netherlands. The battle occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794 Kaiserslautern was part of the Electoral Palatinate but today the city is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany about 67 km west of Mannheim. The Pavilion du Butard is a hunting lodge in the Forêt de Fausses-Reposes in the territory of La Celle-Saint-Cloud in Yvelines, France. Part of the gardens of Versailles, it was designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Louis XV and built between 1750 and 1754. It was made state property on 27 June 1794 by François-Nicolas Périgon, notary at Paris, during the French Revolution. On 23 April 1802 it became the property of empress Joséphine de Beauharnais, who wished to merge it with her Malmaison estate, but it returned to being state property on her divorce from Napoleon in 1809. It was later also enjoyed by Charles X of France and emperor Napoleon III of France. It was occupied by the Prussians during the Franco-Prussian War. Still state property, it was made a monument historique on 29 August 1927. The Alpine Botanical Garden “Saussurea” (Italian: "Giardino Botanico Alpino Saussurea" , French: "Jardin botanique alpin Saussurea" ) (7000 m²) is an alpine botanical garden located at Pavillon du Mont Fréty, first station for the Skyway Monte Bianco cable car, in Courmayeur, Aosta Valley, Italy. It describes itself as Europe's highest botanical garden, at 2173 metres above sea level, and is open daily in the warmer months. Hector-Martin Lefuel (Versailles, 14 November 1810 – Paris, 31 December 1880) was a French architect, best known for the completion of the Palais du Louvre, including the reconstruction of the Pavillon de Flore after a disastrous fire. The Pavillon de l’Horloge (French, "Clock Pavilion"), also known as the Pavillon Sully, is a prominent pavilion located in the center of the west wing of the Cour Carrée (Square Court) of the Palais du Louvre in Paris. The two names Pavillon de l'Horloge and Pavillon Sully are now often reserved for the central pavilion's eastern and western faces, respectively. The Franco-Prussian War or Franco-German War (German: "Deutsch-Französischer Krieg" , French: "Guerre franco-allemande" ), often referred to in France as the War of 1870 (19 July 1870 – 10 May 1871), was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The conflict was caused by Prussian ambitions to extend German unification and French fears of the shift in the European balance of power that would result if the Prussians succeeded. Some historians argue that the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck deliberately provoked a French attack in order to draw the independent southern German states—Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt—into an alliance with the North German Confederation dominated by Prussia, while others contend that Bismarck did not plan anything and merely exploited the circumstances as they unfolded.

**Question:** author of the popular "Getting Started in Electronics" founded Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) in what state?
**Answer:** Albuquerque, New Mexico

**Context:**
Bus monitoring is a term used in flight testing when capturing data from avionics buses and networks in data acquisition telemetry systems. Commonly monitored avionics buses include Kosmos 213 (Russian: Космос 213 meaning "Cosmos 213") was one of a series of Soviet Soyuz programme test spacecraft whose purpose was to further test and develop the passenger version. Scientific data and measurements were relayed to earth by multichannel telemetry systems equipped with space-borne memory units. Kosmos 212 and Kosmos 213 automatically docked in orbit on April 15, 1968. Both spacecraft landed on Soviet territory.

The sessions offer instruction in the following topics: Getting Started on Your Mac, Getting Started on Your iPad, Getting Started on Your iPhone, iCloud, Mail Contacts & Calendars, iPhoto, GarageBand, iMovie, iTunes, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, Aperture, Final Cut Pro, Motion, and Logic Pro. Forrest M. Mims III is an American amateur scientist, magazine columnist, and author of the popular "Getting Started in Electronics" and "Engineer's Mini-Notebook" series of instructional books that was originally sold in Radio Shack electronics stores. Mims graduated from Texas A&M University in 1966 with a major in government and minors in English and history. He became a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force. Advanced Avionics Module or AAM was a module launched on board PSLV-C8 along with Italian satellite AGILE. It was designed by ISRO to test advanced launch vehicle avionics systems like mission computers, navigation and telemetry systems. At lift-off, it weighed 185 kg. Henry Edward "Ed" Roberts (September 13, 1941 – April 1, 2010) was an American engineer, entrepreneur and medical doctor who invented the first commercially successful personal computer in 1975. He is most often known as "the father of the personal computer". He founded Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) in 1970 to sell electronics kits to model rocketry hobbyists, but the first successful product was an electronic calculator kit that was featured on the cover of the November 1971 issue of "Popular Electronics". The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. Andrea Lewis was Microsoft's first technical writer, joining in 1977, and among the group of eleven early employees who posed for an iconic staff portrait taken in Albuquerque in 1978. She had previously edited the monthly newsletter, "Computer Notes", for Microsoft's first customer Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). She left the company in 1983. She is now a freelance writer and she helped build a literary center, Richard Hugo House, named after poet Richard Hugo. Advanced Automatic Collision Notification (AACN) is the successor to Automatic Collision Notification (ACN). To develop procedures that will help emergency medical responders better and more quickly determine if a motorist needs care at a trauma center after a vehicle crash, Center for Disease Control and the CDC Foundation recently partnered with OnStar and the GM Foundation. Through this partnership, CDC conducted a vehicle telematics initiative to develop evidence-based protocols for the emergency medical community to effectively use automotive telemetry data. By enabling responders to more quickly identify, diagnose, and treat injuries, these data will help to reduce death and injuries among vehicle crash victims. As part of this initiative, CDC convened a panel of emergency medical physicians, trauma surgeons, public safety, and vehicle safety experts. The panel considered how real-time crash data from the advanced automatic crash notification (AACN) vehicle telematics system and similar systems can be used to determine whether injured patients need care at a trauma center. By using a collection of sensors, vehicle telemetry systems like AACN send crash data to an advisor if a vehicle is involved in a moderate or severe front, rear, or side-impact crash. Depending on the type of system, the data include information about crash severity, the direction of impact, air bag deployment, multiple impacts, and rollovers (if equipped with appropriate sensors). Advisors can relay this information to emergency dispatchers, helping them to quickly determine the appropriate combination of emergency personnel, equipment, and medical facilities. Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American electronics company founded in Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets such as a roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of "Popular Electronics". The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974. Soyuz-2, GRAU index 14A14, is the collective designation for the new version of the Russian Soyuz rocket. In its basic form, it is a three-stage carrier rocket for placing payloads into low Earth orbit. The first-stage boosters and two core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems, compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz. Digital flight control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight.

**Question:** What is the name of the process used by a company that is located in New Jersey and invented Hexachrome?
**Answer:** CMYKOG process

**Context:**
The Union process was an above ground shale oil extraction technology for production of shale oil, a type of synthetic crude oil. The process used a vertical retort where heating causes decomposition of oil shale into shale oil, oil shale gas and spent residue. The particularity of this process is that oil shale in the retort moves from the bottom upward to the top, countercurrent to the descending hot gases, by a mechanism known as a rock pump. The process technology was invented by the American oil company Unocal Corporation in late 1940s and was developed through several decades. The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort. Hexachrome is a six-color printing process designed by Pantone Inc. In addition to custom CMYK inks, Hexachrome uses orange and green inks to expand the color gamut for better color reproduction. It is therefore also known as a CMYKOG process. New Jersey v. Delaware, 552 U.S. 597 (2008), is a United States Supreme Court case in which New Jersey sued Delaware, invoking the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction under  /1251 § 1251  (a), following Delaware's denial of oil company BP's petition to build a liquefied natural gas pipeline and loading facility on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River. Delaware denied BP's petition because it violated Delaware's Coastal Zone Act. BP then sought New Jersey's approval of the project. Delaware objected because the construction would require dredging of underwater land within Delaware's borders, which extend to the low-tide mark of the New Jersey shore. BP's proposal had not yet passed New Jersey's approval process when New Jersey and BP filed suit against Delaware. Sour mash is a process used in the distilling industry that uses material from an older batch of mash to start the fermentation of a new batch, analogous to the making sourdough bread with a starter. The term "sour mash" can also be used as the name of the type of mash used in that process, and a whiskey made using this process can be referred to as a "sour mash whiskey". Sour mash does not refer to the flavor of the whiskey, as is sometimes thought. Deep inelastic scattering is the name given to a process used to probe the insides of hadrons (particularly the baryons, such as protons and neutrons), using electrons, muons and neutrinos. It provided the first convincing evidence of the reality of quarks, which up until that point had been considered by many to be a purely mathematical phenomenon. It is a relatively new process, first attempted in the 1960s and 1970s. It is an extension of Rutherford scattering to much higher energies of the scattering particle and thus to much finer resolution of the components of the nuclei. Haskell invented a process for making glue from blood-albumin. The process used slaughterhouse blood from the Chicago stock yards. The inexpensive waterproof adhesive was called "black albumin glue." It was used to bond wood pieces. One product Haskell made from this was a lightweight waterproof plywood, first known as Ser-O-Ply. He applied this glue to wood veneers and manufactured plywood for various applications. Some of these applications were boats, airplanes, tanks, trucks, automobiles and rail cars. They were from 1/8th inch thick to just over an inch thick, and had various layers of ply veneers. Typical moldable plywood panels were about five feet wide by twenty feet long and 3/16th of an inch thick. The plywood sheets made this way were eventually given the brand trade name of "haskelite." It is named after Henry L. Haskell, inventor of the glue bonding the plywood. Pantone Inc. is a corporation headquartered in Carlstadt, New Jersey. The company is best known for its Pantone Matching System (PMS), a proprietary color space used in a variety of industries, primarily printing, though sometimes in the manufacture of colored paint, fabric, and plastics. An induction programme is the process used within many businesses to welcome new employees to the company and prepare them for their new role. Its helps in the effective integration of the employee into the organisation. E-COM, short for Electronic Computer Originated Mail, was a hybrid mail process used from 1982 to 1985 by the U.S. Postal Service to print electronically originated mail, and deliver it in envelopes to customers within two days of transmission. The E-COM service allowed customers to transmit messages of up to two pages from their own computers, via telecommunication lines, to one or more of 25 serving post offices (SPOs) located in the following cities: Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, St. Louis, San Antonio, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. After an electronic message was received as a SPO, it was processed and sorted by ZIP Code, then printed on letter-size bond paper, folded, and sealed in an envelope printed with a blue E-COM logo. In order to be eligible for the service, customers were required to send a minimum of 200 messages per transmission. Joint application design (JAD) is a process used in the life cycle area of the dynamic systems development method (DSDM) to collect business requirements while developing new information systems for a company. "The JAD process also includes approaches for enhancing user participation, expediting development, and improving the quality of specifications." It consists of a workshop where "knowledge workers and IT specialists meet, sometimes for several days, to define and review the business requirements for the system." The attendees include high level management officials who will ensure the product provides the needed reports and information at the end. This acts as "a management process which allows Corporate Information Services (IS) departments to work more effectively with users in a shorter time frame".

**Question:** What dynasty was the creator of Mouten Cadet wine a part of?
**Answer:** Rothschild banking dynasty

**Context:**
Cadet Holiday is a 11-minute 1951 Canadian documentary film, made by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) as part of the postwar "Canada Carries On" series. The film, directed by David Bairstow, Robert Humble and Douglas Wilkinson, was produced by Sydney Newman and Michael Spencer. "Cadet Holiday" was an account of a Canadian Army Cadet during a summer camp. The film's French version title is "Cadets en vacances". Ningxia wines are wines produced in the Chinese province of Ningxia (Chinese: 宁夏; pronounced ]). Wine grapes have been grown in the area since 1982, when large Chinese wine producers such as Changyu, Great Wall, and Dynasty established vineyards in the region. At that time, little wine was vinified in the region; rather, the grapes were shipped to more developed regions to be turned into wine. In the late 1990s, the Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Management Bureau began a concerted effort to turn once arid land between the Yellow River and the Helan Mountain foothills into a potential site for vineyard development. From the mid 2000s onwards, Ningxia saw a steady increase in quality wine production, with international wine brands such as Pernod Ricard and LVMH investing in the area. Several boutique, Chinese-owned wineries also began operations in this period, including Helan Qingxue Winery and Silver Heights Vineyard. Following Helan Qingxue's surprise win at the Decanter Worldwide Wine Awards in 2011, Ningxia has seen an explosion of winery development. One unique viticultural feature of the region is the use of sand and earth to bury the vines in the winter, a labor-intensive practice necessary to protect the vines against the cold and dry months from November through March. The Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force (GMACF) is the county cadet force for Greater Manchester which forms part of the wider Army Cadet Force, a youth organisation in the United Kingdom that offers learning and experiences around a military training theme. It is home to between 1400-1750 cadets and 200-230 adult volunteers in 45-47 detachments. GMACF headquarters is at Hawkshaw in Bury, and piping and parade nights are held at Hulme in Manchester. The Honorary Colonel of the GMACF is the Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester, Warren James Smith. The Corps is a poetic hymn associated with the United States Military Academy. It is second in importance to only the Academy's "Alma Mater". The words were written by West Point Chaplain, Bishop H.S. Shipman, around 1902. The accompanying music was composed in 1910 specially for the ceremonial closing of the Old Cadet Chapel and opening of the new Cadet Chapel. "The Corps" was first sung on the steps of the Cadet Chapel on 12 June 1910, and became part of the graduation ceremony starting in 1911. Today, "The Corps" is typically sung by the Cadet Glee Club (West Point's choir) in companion to the Alma Mater at alumni gatherings, graduation, memorial ceremonies and funerals. Philippe, Baron de Rothschild (13 April 1902 – 20 January 1988) was a member of the Rothschild banking dynasty who became a Grand Prix race-car driver, a screenwriter and playwright, a theatrical producer, a film producer, a poet, and one of the most successful wine growers in the world. The House of Valois (] ) was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. They succeeded the House of Capet (or "Direct Capetians") to the French throne, and were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589. Junior members of the family founded cadet branches in Orléans, Anjou, Burgundy, and Alençon. The United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel, completed in 1962, is the distinguishing feature of the Cadet Area at the United States Air Force Academy north of Colorado Springs. It was designed by Walter Netsch of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of Chicago. Construction was accomplished by Robert E. McKee, Inc., of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Originally controversial in its design, the Cadet Chapel has become a classic and highly regarded example of modernist architecture. The Cadet Chapel was awarded the American Institute of Architects' National Twenty-five Year Award in 1996 and, as part of the Cadet Area, was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2004. The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the "infanta" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. The Anscarids (Latin: "Anscarii" ) or the House of Ivrea were a medieval Frankish dynasty of Burgundian origin which rose to prominence in Italy in the tenth century, even briefly holding the Italian throne. They also ruled the County of Burgundy in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and it was one of their members who first declared himself a count palatine. A cadet branch ruled the Kingdom of Galicia from 1111 and the Kingdoms of Castile and León from 1126 until 1369. The House of Trastamara, which ruled in Castile, Aragon, Naples, and Navarre at various points between the late 14th and early 16th centuries, was an illegitimate cadet branch of the family. Mouton Cadet is the brand name of a popular range of modestly priced, generic Bordeaux wines, considered Bordeaux's most successful brand. Created by Baron Philippe de Rothschild, Mouton Cadet wine is produced through the assembly of a variety of grapes, from several Bordeaux region appellations.

**Question:** Were both Sinclair Research and the Wave Mate Bullet founded in the 1970s?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
The Timex Sinclair 1000 (TS1000) was the first computer produced by Timex Sinclair, a joint venture between Timex Corporation and Sinclair Research. It was launched in July 1982, with a US sales price of US$99.95, making it the cheapest home computer to date; it was advertised as "the first computer under $100". The computer was aimed at regular home users. Unlike earlier computers aimed at home users, the TS1000 was not a kit which had to be soldered and assembled. As purchased, the TS1000 was fully assembled and ready to be plugged into the users' home TV (which served as a video monitor). The TS1000 was a slightly-modified version of the Sinclair ZX81 with an NTSC RF modulator, designed for use with North American TVs, instead of the UK PAL RF modulator which was used for units sold in Portugal. The TS1000 doubled the onboard RAM from 1 KB to 2 KB. The TS1000's casing had slightly more internal shielding but remained the same as Sinclair's, including the membrane keyboard. It had black-and-white graphics and no sound. It was followed by an improved version, the Timex Sinclair 1500 which had substantially more RAM (16 KB) and a lower price (US$80). However, the TS1500 did not achieve market success, given that the marketplace was by this time dominated by Commodore, RadioShack, Atari and Apple. The Wave Mate Bullet was a Z80 single-board computer from the late 1970s and early 1980s which used the CP/M operating system. This computer is rarely seen now but has historical value as an early microcomputer pioneer. It was sold in Australia, the United States and Europe and was apparently popular in academic settings. Tony Tebby is probably most famous for designing Qdos, the computer operating system used in the Sinclair QL personal computer, whilst working as an engineer at Sinclair Research in the early 1980s. He left Sinclair Research in 1984 in protest at the premature launch of the QL, and formed QJUMP Ltd., a software house specializing in system software and utilities for the QL, based in Rampton, Cambridgeshire, England. Sinclair Research Ltd is a British consumer electronics company founded by Clive Sinclair in Cambridge. It was originally incorporated in 1973 as Westminster Mail Order Ltd, renamed Sinclair Instrument Ltd, then Science of Cambridge Ltd, then Sinclair Computers Ltd, and finally Sinclair Research Ltd in 1975. It remained dormant until 1976, when it was activated with the intention of continuing Sinclair's commercial work from his earlier company Sinclair Radionics, and adopted the name Sinclair Research in 1981. The ZX81 is a home computer produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Scotland by Timex Corporation. It was launched in the United Kingdom in March 1981 as the successor to Sinclair's ZX80 and was designed to be a low-cost introduction to home computing for the general public. It was hugely successful, and more than 1.5 million units were sold before it was discontinued. The ZX81 found commercial success in many other countries, notably the United States, where it was initially sold as the ZX-81. Timex manufactured and distributed it under licence and enjoyed a substantial but brief boom in sales. Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX81 for the US market – the Timex Sinclair 1000 and Timex Sinclair 1500. Unauthorised clones of the ZX81 were produced in several countries. Jim Westwood was the chief engineer at Sinclair Research Ltd in the 1980s, starting at the company in 1963. Westwood was the technical mastermind behind many of Sinclair's products and worked there for more than twenty years. Sir Clive Sinclair and Westwood shared a connection even before they met when Westwood had previously worked at an electronics store in London which was owned by Bernard Babani, Sinclair's publisher. This gave Westwood a good degree of familiarity with Sinclair's designs, which prompted him to join Sinclair's fledgling company, Sinclair Radionics. Westwood subsequently had a hand in most of the company's products, including the calculators, audio equipment, ZX Spectrum computers and TV80. He is still designing hardware for Amino Communications, and is a partner in Cambridge Electronics Consultancy. Timex Sinclair was a joint venture between the British company Sinclair Research and Timex Corporation in an effort to gain an entry into the rapidly growing early-1980s home computer market in North America. The choice of partnership was natural, as Timex was already the main contractor for manufacture of Sinclair's ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers at its Scottish plant in Dundee. It was Timex of Portugal, though, that took on the R&D and the local manufacturing of the models to be exported to the U.S. Although both Timex of Scotland and Timex of Portugal were full subsidiaries of Timex, internal rivalry, whether unintended or purported, meant there was little sharing between the two plants. Timex of Portugal also sold the Timex Sinclair models in Portugal and Poland under the Timex Computer brand. Sinclair Programs was a magazine published in the United Kingdom, initially by ECC Publications of London and subsequently by EMAP. It was dedicated entirely to listings for programs for the Sinclair Research ZX80, ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers, contributed by readers. The magazine was one of three launched in 1982 by ECC, the other two being "Sinclair User" and "Sinclair Projects", the latter dedicated to hardware projects for the Sinclair computers. The magazine was published between May/June 1982 and September 1985. Nigel Searle was the managing director of Sinclair Research Ltd, and one of the company's longest-serving employees. He joined Sinclair Radionics in 1973, and for most of the 1970s, Searle worked for Sinclair in the United States to promote the company's calculators and other products. In 1977, with Sinclair in financial trouble, Searle left the company. He rejoined in 1979 when Sir Clive Sinclair formed Science of Cambridge (later renamed Sinclair Research) and continued to work from the US, successfully promoting the ZX80 and ZX81 personal computers. In spring 1982, he moved back to the United Kingdom as Sinclair's managing director, a post he retained until 1986 when Amstrad took over the company's computer business. Sinclair BASIC is a dialect of the programming language BASIC used in the 8-bit home computers from Sinclair Research and Timex Sinclair. The Sinclair BASIC interpreter was made by Nine Tiles Networks Ltd.

**Question:** What broadcasting company did both Andrew Collins and Stuart Maconie of Collins and Maconie's Hit Parade both work together from 1194 to 1197?
**Answer:** BBC

**Context:**
Collins and Maconie's Hit Parade was a radio programme that aired from May 1994 to June 1997. There were 74 hour-long episodes and it was broadcast on BBC Radio 1. It starred Andrew Collins and Stuart Maconie. The Soul of North Staffs Recording & Publishing or Sons is an independent record label based in Stoke-on-Trent. The company was formed in 2004 by Neil Graham, Seb Clarke, Al Padmore, James Wakefield and Tangwyn Davies. The label consists solely of bands native to the North Staffordshire area and has become a noted figure both locally and nationally, having recently received attention from Steve Lamacq and Huw Stephens (6music, BBC Radio 1) as well as Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie (BBC Radio 2) SONS has earned comparisons to Factory Records for its DIY ethic and its unique 'SONS sound'. David John "Dave" Hill (born 4 April 1946) is an English musician, who is the lead guitarist and backing vocalist in the English glam rock group, Slade. Hill is known for his flamboyant stage clothes and hairstyle. The music journalist Stuart Maconie commented "he usually wore a jumpsuit made of the foil that you baste your turkeys in and platforms of oil-rig-derrick height. All of this though paled in comparison with his coiffure, a sort of demented tonsure with a great scooping fringe. He even had one outfit around 1973 famously called his 'Metal Nun' suit but later styles were much toned down." Laid is the fifth studio album by British alternative rock band James. It was released on 27 September 1993. It was the first of several collaborations between the group and Brian Eno, who produced all but one of the album's tracks – in Stuart Maconie's authorised biography of the group, "Folklore", they admitted that Eno didn't like the song "One of the Three" so they recorded it when he took a day off. The sessions also resulted in the experimental "Wah Wah" album. Stuart Maconie (born 13 August 1960) is an English radio DJ and television presenter, writer, journalist, and critic working in the field of pop music and popular culture. He is currently a presenter on BBC Radio 6 Music, where he hosts an afternoon show five times a week (Monday–Friday, 1pm–4pm), alongside Mark Radcliffe, called "Radcliffe & Maconie", which broadcasts from the BBC's MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester. The pair had previously presented an evening show on BBC Radio 2. Hit Parade 2 is a compilation album by The Wedding Present released in January 1993. Having decided to release a limited edition single every month for all of 1992 (each featuring an original track on the A side and a cover version on the B side) the group subsequently compiled the songs as two LPs called Hit Parade 1 and Hit Parade 2. In 2003, a double CD was issued called simply "The Hit Parade". "Somebody's Gotta Go" is a 1945 song by Cootie Williams and His Orchestra. With vocals performed by Eddie Vinson, the single was Cootie Williams' most successful entry on the Harlem Hit Parade, hitting number one on the Harlem Hit Parade. "Somebody's Gotta Go" was the final number one on The Harlem Hit Parade chart. Radcliffe & Maconie is a weekday radio programme that is broadcast on BBC Radio 6 Music in the United Kingdom.

**Question:** Which  princess of French origin did Conrad IV of Germany married to 
**Answer:** Isabella II

**Context:**
Henry Raspe (German: "Heinrich Raspe" ) (1204 – 16 February 1247) succeeded his nephew Hermann II as Landgrave of Thuringia in central Germany in 1241; he later was elected anti-king in 1246–1247 in opposition to Conrad IV of Germany. Conrad (25 March 1252 – 29 October 1268), called "the Younger" or "the Boy", but usually known by the diminutive Conradin (German: "Konradin" , Italian: "Corradino" ), was the Duke of Swabia (1254–1268, as Conrad IV), King of Jerusalem (1254–1268, as Conrad III), and King of Sicily (1254–1258, "de jure" until 1268, as Conrad II). Conrad (25 April 1228 – 21 May 1254), a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, was the only son of Emperor Frederick II from his second marriage with Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem. He inherited the title of a King of Jerusalem (as Conrad II) upon the death of his mother in childbed. Appointed Duke of Swabia in 1235, his father had him elected King of Germany (King of the Romans) and crowned King of Italy (as Conrad IV) in 1237. After the emperor was deposed and died in 1250, he ruled as King of Sicily (Conrad I) until his death. Elisabeth of Bavaria (  1227 – 9 October 1273), a member of the House of Wittelsbach, was Queen consort of Germany from 1246 to 1254 by her marriage to King Conrad IV of Germany. Around 45% of English vocabulary is of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. Thoroughly English words of French origin, such as "art", "competition", "force", "machine", "money", "police", "publicity", "role", "routine" and "table", are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin. The conflict between the dynasties of the Capetians and Plantagenets covers a period of 100 years (1159-1259), during which the Kingdom of France fought against the Angevin Empire. This conflict is also called by some historians, the "First Hundred Years War." The conflict is primarily French, since both dynasties were French, the nobles that made up the English army were essentially of French origin, and the foot soldiers of the English king were local recruits in France (Anjou, Guyenne, Normandy, Brittany etc.). At this period, the English king's continental possessions were considered more important than his island possessions, and significantly greater than even those of the French sovereign, even if the latter was the overlord of the former for most of the possessions he held on the continent. And the official language of the two belligerents is the French of that time. French also remained the official language of England until 1361. Such is the origin of the expressions that can still be found today on the shields and coat of arms of the English monarchy "Honi soit qui mal y pense" and "Dieu et mon droit". The English kings, who were of French origin, took wives from France from the 11th to the 15th century. Very rare are those who married a woman of another country, including the cadet branches. Hence the Plantagenet monarchs were ethnically French. Count Conrad V of Rietberg (died 31 October 1472) was Count of Rietberg from 1428 until his death. His father was Count Conrad IV of Rietberg. A great number of words of French origin have entered the English language to the extent that many Latin words have come to the English language. According to different sources, 45% of all English words have a French origin. This suggests that 80,000 words should appear in this list; this list, however, only includes words imported directly from French, such as both and , and does not include derivatives formed in English of words borrowed from French, including , , , and . It also excludes both combinations of words of French origin with words whose origin is a language other than French — e. g.: , , , , , and — and English-made combinations of words of French origin — e. g.: ( + ), ( + ), , , , , , and . This list also excludes words that come from French but were introduced into the English language via a language other than French, which include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Isabella II (121225 April 1228) also known as Yolande of Brienne, was a princess of French origin who became monarch of Jerusalem. Conrad IV of Bussnang or of Bußlingen (died 12 March 1471, Rufach) was a 15th-century Roman Catholic clergyman. He was prince-bishop of Strasbourg from 1439, under emperor Albert II of Germany, pope Eugene IV and his metropolitan bishop Dietrich Schenk von Erbach, bishop of Mainz.

**Question:** Bridge of Spies stars a Soviet intelligence officer with what name?
**Answer:** Rudolf Abel

**Context:**
Gertrude Kahn, also known as Mrs. Ray Kahn, was an American who allegedly had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence during World War II. In a Venona transcript from Moscow, the Moscow Center suggested that Mrs. Kahn had been used for foreign intelligence work.

**Answer:** Richard Strauss

**Context:**
Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None (German: "Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen" , also translated as Thus Spake Zarathustra) is a philosophical novel by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885 and published between 1883 and 1891. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the "eternal recurrence of the same", the parable on the "death of God", and the "prophecy" of the "Übermensch", which were first introduced in "The Gay Science". Ishmael is a 1992 philosophical novel by Daniel Quinn. It examines the mythological thinking at the heart of modern civilization, its effect on ethics, and how this relates to sustainability and societal collapse on the global scale. The novel uses a style of Socratic dialogue to deconstruct the notion that humans are the pinnacle of biological evolution. It posits that anthropocentrism and several other widely accepted modern ideas are actually cultural myths and that global civilization is enacting these myths with catastrophic consequences. The novel was awarded the $500,000 Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award in 1991, a year before its formal publication. The Fall (French: La Chute ) is a philosophical novel by Albert Camus. First published in 1956, it is his last complete work of fiction. Set in Amsterdam, "The Fall" consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed "judge-penitent" Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues; his crisis, and his ultimate "fall" from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, The Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden. "The Fall" explores themes of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth. In a eulogy to Albert Camus, existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described the novel as "perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood" of Camus' books. Sidney is a philosophical novel by the American writer Margaret Deland (1857–1945) set in the 19th century fictional locale of Mercer, an Ohio River community that represents Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

This work is one of the first Arabic novels, may be considered an early example of a science fiction novel, and an early example of a coming of age tale and a desert island story. This novel was written sometime between 1268 and 1277. It was partly a response to the philosophical novel "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan" by Andalusi writer Ibn Tufail. The Time of the Angels is a philosophical novel by British novelist Iris Murdoch. First published in 1966, it was her tenth novel. The novel centres on Carel Fisher, an eccentric Anglican priest who is the rector of a London church which was destroyed by bombing during World War II. Fisher denies the existence of God and the possibility of human goodness in a post-theistic world. The novel, which has elements of Gothic fiction, received mixed reviews on its publication. Also sprach Zarathustra , Op. 30 (Thus Spoke Zarathustra or Thus Spake Zarathustra) is a tone poem by Richard Strauss, composed in 1896 and inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name. The composer conducted its first performance on 27 November 1896 in Frankfurt. A typical performance lasts half an hour.

It explores the intellectual development of its protagonist, a young Roman of integrity, in his pursuit of a congenial religion or philosophy at a time of change and uncertainty that Pater likened to his own era. The narration is third-person, slanted from Marius's point of view, added to which are various interpolated discourses, ranging from adaptations of classical and early Christian writings to Marius’s diary and authorial comment. Hermsprong: or, Man As He Is Not is a 1796 philosophical novel by Robert Bage. It is the main work for which Bage is remembered and was his last novel. He had previously published a novel entitled "Man As He Is". The Cream of the Jest : A Comedy of Evasions is a comical and philosophical novel with possible fantasy elements, by James Branch Cabell, published in 1917. Much of it consists of the historical dreams and philosophical reflections of the main character, the famous writer Felix Kennaston.

**Question:** What year did the sequel to a story that is told through a combination of narrative and vernacular photographs from the personal archives of collectors by Ransom Riggs come out?
**Answer:** 2014

**Context:**
Vernacular photography is the creation of photographs that take everyday life and common things as subjects. Though the more commonly known definition of the word "vernacular" is a quality of being "indigenous" or "native", the use of the word in relation to art and architecture refers more to the meaning of the following sub-definition (of vernacular architecture) from The Oxford English Dictionary: ""concerned with ordinary domestic and functional buildings rather than the essentially monumental."" Examples of vernacular photographs include travel and vacation photos, family snapshots, photos of friends, class portraits, identification photographs, and photo-booth images. Vernacular photographs are types of accidental art, in that they often are unintentionally artistic.

**Question:** What song by the American rapper Coolio is on his greatest hits album "Fantiastic Voyage" and samples from a Stevie Wonder song?
**Answer:** Gangsta's Paradise

**Context:**
"Amish Paradise" is a 1996 single by parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic. It is a parody of the hip hop song "Gangsta's Paradise" by Coolio featuring L.V. (which itself is a reworking of the Stevie Wonder song "Pastime Paradise"). Featured on the album "Bad Hair Day", it turns the original "Gangsta's Paradise", in which the narrator laments his dangerous way of life, on its head by presenting an Amish man praising his relatively plain and uncomplicated existence. "Ribbon in the Sky" is a hit 1982 R&B single released by Tamla/Motown star and American singer Stevie Wonder. The ballad was first featured on the greatest hits album, "Stevie Wonder's Original Musiquarium I", and charted at #54 pop and #10 R&B when it was released. In February 1983, Wonder was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance at the 25th Grammy Awards. Wonder performed a version of the song at Whitney Houston's funeral on February 18, 2012. "It's All the Way Live (Now)" is a song by American rapper Coolio. It was released in May 1996 as the lead single to the "Eddie" soundtrack. The song became Coolio's fifth top-40 single and his fourth to achieve at least a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies. The song sampled "It's All the Way Live" by funk band Lakeside, his second single to both sample and take the name from a Lakeside song after his 1994 hit, "Fantastic Voyage". "Wish You Were Mine" is a song by English producer Philip George. It samples the Stevie Wonder song "My Cherie Amour". It was released on 28 December 2014 as a digital download in the United Kingdom through 3 Beat Productions. The song peaked to number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, remaining there for three consecutive weeks. "Curtain Falls" is a song by English boy band Blue. It was released on 8 November 2004 as the first single from their first greatest hits album, "Best of Blue" (2004). The song was co-written by the band and Stargate, and produced by Stargate and reached number one in Italy. In France, the song was re-recorded in French and re-titled "Quand Le Rideau Tombe", and thus, this version was released as a single there. The background music is almost identical to that of Coolio's 1995 hit, "Gangsta's Paradise", as they both share usage of a sample of Stevie Wonder's "Pastime Paradise". Dance Again... the Hits is the first greatest hits album of American singer Jennifer Lopez. It was released on July 20, 2012, by Epic Records, to coincide with the launch of her first world tour, the Dance Again World Tour. Lopez previously conceived plans for a greatest hits album in 2009, but instead opted to use the material recorded for her seventh studio album, "Love? ", which was released by Island Records in May 2011 after her departure from Epic Records in 2010. As Lopez owed the label one last album to fulfill her contract, she began work on a new greatest hits album in November 2011. She later became unsure whether she wanted to go along with plans to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album, eventually deciding on the former. "Fantastic Voyage" is a song by American rapper Coolio. It was released in March 1994 as the third single from his debut album, "It Takes a Thief." The song later featured on the album "." The song samples "Fantastic Voyage" by Lakeside. "All in Love Is Fair" is a song by American singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder for his sixteenth studio album, "Innervisions" (1973). Written and produced by Wonder, it was released as a 7" single in Brazil in 1974. The song is a pop ballad with lyrics that describe the end of a relationship through the use of clichés. Critical reaction to the song was varied: Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic wrote that it was among Wonder's "finest ballad statements", but Robert Christgau felt that the singer's performance was "immature". Wonder has included it on several of his greatest hits albums, including the most recent, 2005's "The Complete Stevie Wonder". "Gangsta's Paradise" is a song by American rapper Coolio, featuring singer L.V. The song was released on Coolio's album of the same name, as well as the soundtrack for the 1995 film "Dangerous Minds". It samples the chorus and instrumentation of Stevie Wonder's 1976 song "Pastime Paradise". Fantastic Voyage: The Greatest Hits is a compilation album by rapper Coolio, released in 2001. It includes the track "Aw Here it Goes" he contributed as a main theme to TV series "Kenan & Kel".

**Question:** What is the city where Orville Siegfried went to college and that is located in Jackson county?
**Answer:** Lee's Summit, Missouri

**Context:**
Orville Maynard Siegfried (February 19, 1903 – May 1965) was a professional American football player for the St. Louis All-Stars. He attended high school in Lee's Summit, Missouri. He attended Washington & Jefferson College. Jackson County is located in the Arkansas Delta in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The county is named for Andrew Jackson, a national hero during the War of 1812. By the county's formation in 1829, Jackson had become the seventh President of the United States. Jackson County is home to seven incorporated towns and four incorporated cities, including Newport, the largest city and county seat. The county is also the site of numerous unincorporated communities and ghost towns. Occupying 633.94 sqmi , Woodruff County is the 41st largest county of the 75 in Arkansas. As of the 2010 Census, the county's population is 17,997 people in 7,601 households. Based on population, the county is the 40th-largest county in Arkansas. Although terrain rises in the west, most of Jackson County is within the Arkansas Delta, characterized by largely flat terrain with fertile soils. Historically covered in forest, bayous and swamps, the area was cleared for agriculture by early settlers. It is drained by the White River. Advent is an unincorporated community in southeastern Jackson County, West Virginia, United States. It lies along Advent Road southeast of the city of Ripley, the county seat of Jackson County, and near Jackson County's borders with Kanawha and Roane counties. Its elevation is 791 feet (241 m). Advent had a post office, which closed on December 25, 2010. Jackson College is a college located in Jackson County, Michigan. Originally established as Jackson Junior College in 1928, Jackson County electors voted to reincorporate the institution as a Community College District under the "Public Act 188 of 1955" in 1962.

The Jackson County Recreation Department and the Jackson County Airport are also located in the Cullowhee area. The name of the town was long thought to mean "Valley of the Lillies," but is actually derived from part of the Cherokee phrase "joolth-cullah-wee" which translates as "Judacullah's Place." Judacullah, a giant warrior and hunter who the Cherokee believe lived in the area, is an important figure in their religion and culture. The Jackson County Courthouse, located at Main Street and Broadway in Altus, is the county courthouse serving Jackson County, Oklahoma. Construction began on the courthouse in 1910, two years after Altus became the permanent county seat of Jackson County, and was completed in 1911. Architecture firm C.E. Hair and Company designed the building in the Classical Revival style; it was the first county courthouse the firm planned in Oklahoma. The three-story courthouse is built from limestone with a granite foundation. A two-story portico supported by four columns surrounds the main entrance. While a metal dome originally topped the building, it was removed in 1938 due to irreparable corrosion.

The wooden Grist Mill located here since the 1840s burned to the ground in the summer of 1965. Its foundation stones remain. It had remained in operation full-time until 1930, part-time until 1937. Cottageville was a commercial center with a bank, newspaper, tannery, blacksmith, several stores, a railroad station on the B & O and many other businesses in the early part of the twentieth century. Its heyday faded with the closing of the mill and the improvement of roads in the county. The B & O pulled up its tracks to the county seat, Ripley, in the mid-nineteen-sixties.

Jackson County Early College is a part of the Jackson County School System. It serves as an extension of Smoky Mountain High School, with Students being able to participate in Smoky Mountain Extracurricular activities, such as Marching Band, Indoor Percussion, Jazz Band, Sports, and some Clubs. It was originally located in Oaks Hall on the Southwestern Community College Campus in Webster, NC, where quarters were tight due to the increasing enrollment of the Early College and Southwestern Community College, but it moved in the Fall of 2010 to a building with eight classrooms built by the county for the student's High School Classes, to get them out of the college buildings. This has also allowed for the ability of the enrollment to go up to over 100. The Early College also relieves pressure from Smoky Mountain High School, which at one time boasted a little over 900 students, but has dropped down to a more manageable size of around 780 students.

**Question:** Kacha, Sevastopol is a settlement that is part of a sovereign state bordered on the northwest by which country?

**Context:**
The development of states—large-scale, populous, politically centralized, and socially stratified polities/societies governed by powerful rulers—marks one of the major milestones in the evolution of human societies. Archaeologists often distinguish between primary (or pristine) states and secondary states. Primary states evolved independently through largely internal developmental processes rather than through the influence of any other pre-existing state. The earliest known primary states appeared in Mesopotamia c. 3700 BC, in Egypt c. 3300 BC, in the Indus Valley c. 2500 BC, India c. 1700 BC, and in China c. 1600 BC. As they interacted with their less developed neighbors through trade, warfare, migration, and more generalized ideological influences, the primary states directly or indirectly fostered the emergence of secondary states in surrounding areas, for example, the Hittites in Anatolia, the Minoan and Mycenaean states of the Aegean, or the Nubian kingdoms in the Sudan. According to Professor Gil Stein of the University of Chicago Oriental Institute, "The excavations and archaeological surveys of the last few decades have vastly increased both the quantity and quality of what we know about ancient states and urbanism. Archaeologists have broadened the scope of their research beyond the traditional focus on rulers and urban elites. Current research now aims at understanding the role of urban commoners, craft specialists, and village-based farmers in the overall organization of ancient states and societies.

**Question:** Which genus of flowering plants has the most species, Caesalpinia or Achimenes?
**Answer:** Caesalpinia

**Context:**
Caesalpinia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. Historically, membership within the genus has been highly variable, with different publications including anywhere from 70 to 165 species, depending largely on the inclusion or exclusion of species alternately listed under genera such as "Hoffmannseggia". It contains tropical or subtropical woody plants. The generic name honors the botanist, physician, and philosopher Andrea Cesalpino (1519–1603). Psychotria is a genus of flowering plants in the Rubiaceae family. It contains around 1,850 species and is therefore one of the largest genera of flowering plants. The genus has a pantropical distribution and members of the genus are small understorey trees in tropical forests. Some species are endangered or facing extinction due to deforestation, especially species of central Africa and the Pacific. Cyrtandra is a genus of flowering plants containing about 600 species, with more being discovered often, and is thus the largest genus in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, with the centre of diversity in Southeast Asia and the Malesian region. The genus is common, but many species within it are very rare, localized, endangered endemic plants. The species can be difficult to identify because they are highly polymorphic and because they readily hybridize with each other. The plants may be small herbs, vines, shrubs, epiphytes, or trees. The genus is characterized in part by having two stamens, and most species have white flowers, with a few red-, orange-, yellow- and pink-flowered species known. Almost all species live in rainforest habitats. Austrobaileyales is an order of flowering plants, consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas. Perhaps the most familiar species is "Illicium verum", from which comes the spice star anise. The order belongs to the group of basal angiosperms, the ANA grade, which diverged earlier from the remaining flowering plants, and, as such, it is the extant group after the Amborellales and Nymphaeales, that is sister to all remaining extant angiosperms outside of the ANA grade. The order includes just three families of flowering plants, the Austrobaileyaceae, a monotypic family containing the sole genus, "Austrobaileya scandens", a woody liana, the Schisandraceae, a family of trees, shrubs, or lianas containing essential oils, and the Trimeniaceae, essential oil-bearing trees and lianas. Zeltnera is a genus of flowering plants in the gentian family. It was erected in 2004 when the genus "Centaurium" (the centauries) was split. Genetic analysis revealed that "Centaurium" was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus. "Centaurium" remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species. The Mexican species now belong to genus "Gyrandra", and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus "Schenkia". The new name "Zeltnera" was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American centauries. There are about 25 species. Echinacea is a genus, or group of herbaceous flowering plants in the daisy family. The "Echinacea" genus has nine species, which are commonly called purple coneflowers. They are found only in eastern and central North America, where they are found growing in moist to dry prairies and open wooded areas. They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming from early to late summer. The generic name is derived from the Greek word ἐχῖνος ("ekhinos"), meaning "hedgehog," due to the spiny central disk. These flowering plants and their parts have different uses. Some species are cultivated in gardens for their showy flowers. "Echinacea purpurea" is used in folk medicine. Two of the species, "E. tennesseensis" and "E. laevigata", are listed in the United States as endangered species. Achimenes is a genus of about 25 species of tropical and subtropical rhizomatous perennial herbs in the flowering plant family Gesneriaceae. They have a multitude of common names such as magic flowers, widow's tears, Cupid's bower, or hot water plant. Eriocaulon is a genus of about 400 species commonly known as pipeworts, of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Eriocaulaceae. The genus is widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical regions, particularly southern Asia and the Americas. A few species extend to temperate regions, with ca. 10 species in the United States, mostly in the southern states from California to Florida, and only two species in Canada; China has 35 species, also mostly southern. Only one species ("E. aquaticum") occurs in Europe, where it is confined to the Atlantic Ocean coasts of Scotland and Ireland; this species also occurs in eastern North America and is thought to be a relatively recent natural colonist in Europe. In the Americas, "Eriocaulon" is the only genus in its family that occurs north of Florida. They tend to be associated with wet soils, many growing in shallow water, in wetlands, or in wet savannas like flatwoods. In wet soils, their abundance appears to be related to water levels, fire frequency, and competition from other plants such as grasses. Experiments have shown that they are weak competitors compared to many other wetland plant species. Some species can persist as buried seeds during unfavorable conditions. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek εριον, "erion", meaning 'wool', and καυλός, "caulos", meaning 'stalk'. Sudamerlycaste is a genus of flowering plants in the Orchidaceae family. It consists of approximately 45 species. The genus was split off from "Lycaste" in 2002 by Fredy Archila. Species in "Lycaste" that were endemic to South America and the Caribbean Islands were placed into the new genus "Sudamerlycaste" and those found in Mexico and Central America stayed in "Lycaste". As a result of this change most of the species previously found in the "Lycaste" section "Fimbriatae" were then moved to the genus "Sudamerlycaste". Species are either epiphytes or terrestrial. In 2003 Henry Oakeley and Angela Ryan published the genus name "Ida" to accommodate South American and Caribbean plants previously placed in "Lycaste". Their description included the type species of "Sudamerlycaste", "Lycaste andreettae". This renders "Ida" an illegitimate name. Magnolia virginiana, most commonly known as sweetbay magnolia, or merely sweetbay (also laurel magnolia, swampbay, swamp magnolia, whitebay, or beaver tree), is a member of the magnolia family, Magnoliaceae. It was the first magnolia to be scientifically described under modern rules of botanical nomenclature, and is the type species of the genus "Magnolia"; as "Magnolia" is also the type genus of all flowering plants (magnoliophytes), this species in a sense typifies all flowering plants.

**Question:** How long does the lower level degree program, offered at Helene Fuld College of Nursing, typically last?
**Answer:** two years

**Context:**
The UIC College of Pharmacy (UIC COP) is a public pharmacy school with two campuses located in Chicago and Rockford, Illinois. It offers a four-year professional degree program that leads to the PharmD, the highest level of professional education in pharmacy, which is approved by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education as the sole entry level degree for the profession. Besides the professional degree, the College also offers programs leading to six master's degrees and four doctorate degrees, covering a spectrum of research areas within the pharmaceutical sciences. Multi-level caches can be designed in various ways depending on whether the content of one cache is present in other level of caches. If all blocks in the higher level cache are also present in the lower level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be inclusive of the higher level cache. If the lower level cache contains blocks that are not present in the higher level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be exclusive of the higher level cache. If the contents of the lower level cache are neither strictly inclusive nor exclusive of the higher level cache, then it is called non-inclusive non-exclusive (NINE) cache. An associate degree (or associate's degree) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study intended to usually last two years. It is considered to be greater level of education than a high school diploma or GED. The University of Nursing, Yangon (Burmese: သူနာပြု တက္ကသိုလ် (ရန်ကုန်) ] ; formerly The Institute of Nursing, Yangon) is a nursing university, located in Lanmadaw Township, Yangon, Myanmar. It is one of three universities in the country that offers a four-year bachelor's degree program in nursing (i.e. B.N.Sc (Generic)). The UON - Yangon also offers a master's degree program in nursing and diploma programs in dental, EENT, mental health, pediatrics, critical care, and orthopedics. Moreover, there is a two-year B.N.Sc (Bridge) program for in-service nurses who have earned a nursing diploma. The Helene Fuld Health Trust is the largest charitable trust in the United States devoted exclusively to supporting student nurses and nursing education. The trust — which began as a foundation in 1935, but transferred its assets to the trust in 1969 — has provided grants, scholarships, and financial aid for the education, health, and welfare of student nurses. The University of Nursing, Mandalay (also the Institute of Nursing, Mandalay; Burmese: သူနာပြု တက္ကသိုလ် (မန္တလေး) , ] ) is a university of nursing, located in Mandalay, Myanmar. It is one of three universities in the nation that offers a four-year bachelor's degree program in nursing. The university also offers a master's degree program in nursing. Nurse education consists of the theoretical and practical training provided to nurses with the purpose to prepare them for their duties as nursing care professionals. This education is provided to nursing students by experienced nurses and other medical professionals who have qualified or experienced for educational tasks. Most countries offer nurse education courses that can be relevant to general nursing or to specialized areas including mental health nursing, pediatric nursing and post-operatory nursing. Courses leading to autonomous registration as a nurse typically last four years. Nurse education also provides post-qualification courses in specialist subjects within nursing. The Master of Science in Leadership (MSL) is a master's degree in leadership studies that is offered by a college of business. It is an alternative to, not a substitute for, the traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The MSL degree requirements may include some business/management courses that are required in an MBA program. However, this degree program concentrates heavily on leader-follower interactions, cross-cultural communications, coaching, influencing, team development, leading organizational changes, strategic thinking, project leadership, and behavioral motivation theories. It does not concentrate on financial or quantitative analysis, marketing, or accounting which are common in MBA programs. The degree program is appealing to businesspeople in well-established careers already. The MSL degree is similar to the Master of Science in Organizational Leadership (MSOL) degree or the Master of Leadership Sciences degree offered by the National School of Leadership in India. The Helene Fuld College of Nursing is an American private, nonsectarian institution of higher learning that offers associate and comprehensive baccalaureate science degrees as continuing education to Licensed Practical and Registered Nurses who aspire to elevate their academic and professional credentials. The college is located in New York City in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in the Mount Morris Park Historic District at Marcus Garvey Park. It was founded years ago – in 1945. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN, BScN) also known in some countries as a Bachelor of Nursing (BN) or Bachelor of Science (BS) with a Major in Nursing is an academic degree in the science and principles of nursing, granted by an accredited tertiary education provider. The course of study is typically three or four years. The difference in degree designation may relate to the amount of basic science courses required as part of the degree, with BScN and BSN degree curriculums requiring completion of more courses on math and natural sciences that are more typical of BSc degrees (e.g. calculus, physics, chemistry, biology) and BN curriculums more focused on nursing theory, nursing process, and teaching versions of general science topics that are adapted to be more specific and relevant to nursing practice. Nursing school students are generally required to take courses in social and behavioral sciences and liberal arts, including nutrition, anatomy, chemistry, mathematics, and English. In addition to those courses, experience in physical and social sciences, communication, leadership, and critical thinking is required for a bachelor's degree. BSN programs typically last 3-4 years. With a BSN you can work in private medical and surgical hospital, a physician's office, public medical and surgical hospitals, home health care services, and nursing facilities. Having a BSN can result in more opportunities and better salary than just an associate degree.

**Question:** What group of people are described as semi-nomadic and speak the Semitic language ? 
**Answer:** Semitic people

**Context:**
Semites, Semitic people or Semitic cultures (from the biblical "Shem", Hebrew: שם‎ ‎ ) was a term for an ethnic, cultural or racial group who speak or spoke the Semitic languages. The terminology was first used in the 1770s by members of the Göttingen School of History, who derived the name from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis. The term "Semites", together with the parallel terms Hamites and Japhetites, is now largely obsolete outside linguistics. However, in archaeology, the term is sometimes used informally as "a kind of shorthand" for ancient Semitic-speaking peoples. Himyaritic or Al-Himyariah (Arabic: لغة حمير‎ ‎ "luġat Ḥimyar", "Language of Himyar") is a Semitic language that was spoken in Yemen, according to some by the Himyarites. Others consider it to have existed after the demise of the Himyarite period. It was a Semitic language, but did not belong to the Old South Arabian (Sayhadic) languages. The precise position inside Semitic is unknown because of the limited knowledge of the language. The Upper Kuskokwim people or Upper Kuskokwim Athabaskans, Upper Kuskokwim Athabascans (own native name "Dichinanek' Hwt'ana"), and historically Kolchan, Goltsan, Tundra Kolosh, and McGrath Ingalik are an Alaskan Athabaskan people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group. First delineation of this ethnolinguistic group was described by anthropologist Edward Howard Hosley (who has specialized in the study of Alaskan Athabaskan cultures) in 1968, as Kolchan. According to Hosley, "Nevertheless, as a group possessing a history and a culture differing from those of its neighbours, the Kolchan deserve to be recognized as an independent group of Alaskan Athapaskans." They are the original inhabitants of the Upper Kuskokwim River villages of Nikolai, Telida, and McGrath, Alaska. About 25 of a total of 100 Upper Kuskokwim people still speak the language. They speak a distinct Athabaskan language (as Upper Kuskokwim language or "Dinak'i") more closely related to Lower Tanana language than to Deg Xinag language (formerly Ingalik), spoken on the middle Kuskokwim. The term used by the Kolchan themselves is "Dina'ena" (lit. «the people» as "Tenaynah" by Hosley), but this is too similar to the adjacent Tanana and Tanaina (today Dena'ina) for introduction into the literature. Nowadays, the term used by the Kolchan themselves is "Dichinanek' Hwt'ana" (lit. «Timber River people»). Their neighbors also knew them by this name. In Tanaina they were "Kenaniq' ht'an" while the Koyukon people to the north referred to them as "Dikinanek Hut'ana". The Upper Kuskokwim Athabaskan culture is an hunter-gatherer culture and have a matrilineal system. They are were semi-nomadic and as living in semi-permanent settlements. Hebrew ( ; , "Ivrit " ] or ] ) is a Northwest Semitic language native to Israel, spoken by over 9 million people worldwide. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites and their ancestors, although the language was not referred to by the name Hebrew in the Tanakh. The earliest examples of written Paleo-Hebrew date from the 10th century BCE. Hebrew belongs to the West Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Hebrew is the only living Canaanite language left, and the only truly successful example of a revived dead language. Maltese (Maltese: "Malti" ) is the national language of Malta and a co-official language of the country alongside English, while also serving as an official language of the European Union, the only Semitic language so distinguished. Maltese is descended from Siculo-Arabic, the extinct variety of Arabic that developed in Sicily and was later introduced to Malta, between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century. Maltese has evolved independently of Literary Arabic and its varieties into a standardized language over the past 800 years in a gradual process of Latinisation. Maltese is therefore considered an exceptional branch of Arabic that does not share diglossia with Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic. Maltese is also unique among Semitic languages since its morphology has been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian. The original Semitic base (Siculo-Arabic) comprises around one-third of the Maltese vocabulary, especially words that denote basic ideas and the function words, but about half of the vocabulary is derived from standard Italian and Sicilian; and English words make up between 6% and 20% of the vocabulary. A recent study shows that, in terms of basic everyday language, speakers of Maltese are able to understand less than a third of what is said to them in Tunisian Arabic, which is related to Siculo-Arabic, whereas speakers of Tunisian are able to understand about 40% of what is said to them in Maltese. This reported level of asymmetric intelligibility is considerably lower than the mutual intelligibility found between Arabic dialects. Maltese has always been written in the Latin script, the earliest surviving example dating from the late Middle Ages. It remains the only standardized Semitic language written in the Latin script. Gararish is a designated tribal area within the Northern wilayat (state) of Sudan, to the south of the state's capital, Dongola and on the right bank of the River Nile. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica describes the Gararish as a semi-nomadic, semi-agricultural tribe "of Semitic origin" and gives their location as further north, between Wadi Haifa and Merawi. The Tigrinyas (also referred to as Biher Tigrinya, Kebessa, and Biher-Tigrinya) are an ethnic group inhabiting central Eritrea, an area spanning the Southern and Central, as well as the Northern Red Sea and Anseba Regions - mostly part of the Eritrean highlands (hence the name Kebessa meaning 'highland' in the local language). Ethnolinguistically, Tigrinyas are related to the Tigrayans of Ethiopia, both of whom speak Tigrinya, an Ethiopian Semitic language belonging to the Afroasiatic family. Most are followers of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. They make up roughly 55% of Eritrea's population numbering 3.4 million people. They are not to be confused with the Tigre people who speak Tigre, a closely related Afroasiatic language. An undeciphered alphabetic stele found in Ördek-Burnu, 20 km south of Sam'al (8 miles south of Zinjirli) in what is now northern Syria, dates to the 9th century BCE. The language of the inscription is difficult to interpret. It contains Semitic words but is not grammatically Semitic, and may be a mixture of Luwian and a Semitic language. It is kept in Istanbul. Argobba is an Ethiopian Semitic language spoken in an area north-east of Addis Ababa by the Argobba people. It belongs to the South Ethiopian Semitic subgroup together with Amharic and the Gurage languages. Writing in the mid-1960s, Edward Ullendorff noted that it "is disappearing rapidly in favour of Amharic, and only a few hundred elderly people are still able to speak it." Today, many Argobba in the Harari region are shifting to the Oromo language. The Central Semitic languages are a proposed intermediate group of Semitic languages, comprising the Late Iron Age, modern dialect of Arabic (prior to which Arabic was a Southern Semitic language), and older Bronze Age Northwest Semitic languages (which include Aramaic, Ugaritic, and the Canaanite languages of Hebrew and Phoenician). In this reckoning, Central Semitic itself is one of three divisions of Semitic along with East Semitic (Akkadian and Eblaite) and South Semitic (South Arabian and the Ethiopian Semitic languages).

**Question:** What Italian region does Slinzega come from?
**Answer:** Lombardy

**Context:**
Bresaola (] ) is air-dried, salted beef (but also horse, venison and pork) that has been aged two or three months until it becomes hard and turns a dark red, almost purple colour. It is made from top (inside) round, and is lean and tender, with a sweet, musty smell. It originated in Valtellina, a valley in the Alps of northern Italy's Lombardy region. Slinzega is a type of air-dried meat produced in Valtellina, in the Italian Alps. It is made in a similar manner to Bresaola, with smaller pieces of meat, which therefore bear a stronger taste. According to some sources it originally used horse meat rather than beef. Nevertheless, today virtually any type of meat is suitable to its production, the most common being beef, deer and pork. Policoro is a town and "comune" in the province of Matera, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata. It is bounded by the towns of Rotondella, Scanzano Jonico and Tursi. Policoro is a relatively small town of approximately 17,000 inhabitants. Situated on the coast, its population swells in the summertime due to an influx of tourists who come to enjoy the Lido di Policoro. The Insubres or Insubri were a Gaulish population settled in Insubria, in what is now the Italian region of Lombardy. They were the founders of Mediolanum (Milan). Though completely Gaulish at the time of Roman conquest, they were the result of the fusion of pre-existing Ligurian and Celtic population with Gaulish tribes who had come from what is now Central Europe.

**Question:** Are Tetrastigma and Spruce both types of plants?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
The Massawepie Mire is a boreal peatland bog in Piercefield, New York, located near Massawepie Lake. Covering an area of over 900 acres, the mire is the largest bog in New York State. This large size is due to its position in a large, shallow glacial basin. Much of the bog is on the property of Massawepie Scout Camps, and the camp partners with the Nature Conservancy to preserve the ecosystem. The Massawepie Mire is noted for birdwatching, with several species of rare birds occupying the area including spruce grouse, gray jay, Lincoln's sparrow, boreal chickadee, and the two-barred crossbill. Flora includes the carnivorous pitcher plants and sundew, tamarack pines and black spruce trees, as well as the sphagnum moss that makes up the base of the bog. Tetrastigma is a genus of plants in the grape family, Vitaceae. The plants are lianas that climb with tendrils and have palmately compound leaves. The species are found in subtropical and tropical regions of Asia, Malaysia, and Australia, where they grow in primary rainforest, gallery forest and monsoon forest and moister woodland. Species of this genus are notable as being the sole hosts of parasitic plants in the family Rafflesiaceae, one of which, "Rafflesia arnoldii", produces the largest single flower in the world. Sapria is a genus of parasitic flowering plants. It grows within roots of "Vitis" and "Tetrastigma". The genus is limited to the tropical forests of South and South-east Asia. The Baikal Nature Reserve ( ; Russian: Байка́льский запове́дник , "Baikalski Zapovednik") is a nature reserve on the southeast shore of Lake Baikal, in southern Buryatia, Russia. Also called Baikal Zapovednik, it was established in 1969 for preserving the nature along the lake and the neighboring central part of the Chamar-Daban Range. The area of this nature reserve is 165,700 ha . It hosts dark pine taiga (silver fir, cedar, spruce), thin forests, Siberian Dwarf Pine and rhododendron underbrush, subalpine meadows, and alpine tundras. The Baikal Nature Reserve is home to 812 kinds of plants, 49 types of mammals, 272 birds, 3 reptiles, 3 amphibians, and 7 types of fish. The reserve is also home to East Siberian brown bear, Baikal lynx, wolverine, otter, osprey, and golden eagle. The Baikal Nature Reserve is part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (also see "List of biosphere reserves in the Russian Federation"). The reserve is also a part of the Lake Baikal World Heritage Site. The Kabansky Nature Zakaznik, across , was transferred under the jurisdiction of the Baikal Nature Reserve in 1985. There are currently two main types of power plants operating in Nigeria: (1) hydro-electric and (2) thermal or fossil fuel power plants. With a total installed capacity of 8457.6MW (81 percent of total) in early 2014, thermal power plants (gas-fired plants) dominates the Nigerian power supply mix. Electricity production from hydroelectric sources (% of total) in Nigeria was reported at 17.59 % in 2014, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. There have been two main types of fossil fuel/thermal power plants in the country: (i) coal-fired and (ii) natural gas-fired. A spruce is a tree of the genus Picea , a genus of about 35 species of coniferous evergreen trees in the family Pinaceae, found in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of the earth. Spruces are large trees, from about 20–60 m (about 60–200 ft) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small, peg-like structure. The needles are shed when 4–10 years old, leaving the branches rough with the retained pegs (an easy means of distinguishing them from other similar genera, where the branches are fairly smooth). Rhizanthes is a genus of 4 species of parasitic flowering plants without leaves, stems, roots, or photosynthetic tissue. They grow on roots of a few species of "Tetrastigma" vines. The genus is limited to the tropical forests of south and south-east Asia. The flowers of "Rhizanthes" vary from 14 to 43 cm in diameter. At least one species of "Rhizanthes", "R. lowii", is endothermic. It not only produces its own heat, but has the rare ability to regulate its own temperature. A trellis (treillage) is an architectural structure, usually made from an open framework or lattice of interwoven or intersecting pieces of wood, bamboo or metal that is normally made to support and display climbing plants, especially shrubs. There are many types of trellis for different places and for different plants, from agricultural types, especially in viticulture, which are covered at vine training systems, to garden uses for climbers such as grapevines, clematis, ivy, and climbing roses or other support based growing plants. The rose trellis is especially common in Europe and other rose-growing areas, and many climbing rose varieties require a trellis to reach their potential as garden plants. Some plants will climb and wrap themselves round a trellis without much artificial help being needed while others need training by passing the growing shoots through the trellis and/or tying them to the framework. The Rafflesiaceae are a family of rare parasitic plants found in the tropical forests of east and southeast Asia, including "Rafflesia arnoldii", which has the largest flowers of all plants. The plants are endoparasites of vines in the genus "Tetrastigma" (Vitaceae) and lack stems, leaves, roots, and any photosynthetic tissue. They rely entirely on their host plants for both water and nutrients, and only then emerge as flowers from the roots or lower stems of the host plants. Elliott Knob is one of the highest mountains in the northern portions of the U.S. state of Virginia. At 4463 ft , the peak is located on the ridge known as Great North Mountain. A subpeak known simply as "Hogback" (4447 ft ) is located .50 mi to the southwest. A small, naturally growing stand of red spruce trees are on the summit, and the upper slopes also have yellow birch and sugar maple, indicating that the altitude is just high enough to support tree species normally found hundreds of miles to the north. Otherwise oak and hickory trees are the most common types found on the mountain. The mountain is entirely within George Washington and Jefferson National Forests.

Damodaran, the film tells the fictional story of Corporal Khader (Mammootty), a former British army officer and World War I veteran, who joins with the Mappila rebels during the Uprising. Home and Away: Revenge is a television film and spin-off of the Australian soap opera "Home and Away". It was co-written by Dan Bennett and Brooke Wilson, and directed by Arnie Custo. "Revenge" premiered on 19 December 2016 on Foxtel on Demand, Foxtel Play and Presto, shortly after the season finale of "Home and Away" aired on Seven Network. It was commissioned along with "Home and Away: All or Nothing" following the success of the 2015 telefilm "", which broke Presto streaming records. "Revenge" serves as a sequel to "An Eye for an Eye" and also features current and returning "Home and Away" cast members. Joshua "Josh" Barrett is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Home and Away", played by Jackson Gallagher. The actor was initially hesitant about auditioning for the role, as he believed he was too old to portray a 16-year-old. However, three days after attending the audition, he learnt he was successful. Gallagher relocated to Sydney for filming. His character was introduced along with his on-screen brother Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) through a series of online webisodes titled "Home and Away Extras". He then made his debut appearance in "Home and Away" during the episode broadcast on 27 August 2013. Gallagher's departure from "Home and Away" was announced in May 2016, and Josh's last scenes aired on 5 July 2016. The season started with a change of coach (Gareth James) and a change of captain (Arwel Williams). Appointed vice captain was Mathew Scott. A level of ‘expectancy’ thus ensued and with a start of two competitive friendlies both at home, the league began in earnest with a traditionally unlucky fixture for the ‘Fera away at Cwmavon. Past history meant for nothing however and a well organised and structured performance ended in a fine 29–19 win. A repeat showing a week later at home to Brynamman and a 26–6 win, led to a position of a little over-confidence, ‘Fera narrowly exiting the Swansea Valley Cup in the 1st Round three days later away to Morriston. Back on track with a determined and physical victory at Bryncoch 25–15, the next home game was again against a traditional ‘bogey’ side Kenfig Hill. This was a typical ‘old style’ West Wales affair with yellow and red cards for both sides, Ystalyfera losing 11–29 after keeping in touch with the visitors for a greater part of the game. A return to Morriston for a league fixture saw a much better controlled performance with a 20–15 win, and a further win at Pencoed made it four continuous league away victories. The Pencoed win was the first in the season where Ystalyfera out-played their opponents in every area of the game, the hosts being unable to seek any avenue to secure a fight back. This repeated itself against Nantyffyllon home and self-confidence was building amongst the side. Then came Aberavon Green Stars away. In this game and in the subsequent losses home to Glynneath and away at Seven Sisters, the effort put in by individual players was noticeable, but the co-ordinated team tactics were missing and a struggle against well organised opponents ensued. Brenton Thwaites (born 10 August 1989) is an Australian actor who is known for his portrayal of Luke Gallagher in the Fox8 teen drama series "Slide" (2011), and later Stu Henderson in the soap opera "Home and Away" (2011–2012). Since moving to the United States, Thwaites has had major roles in the films "" (2012), "Oculus" (2013), "The Giver" (2014), "Gods of Egypt" (2016), and "" (2017). Office Uprising is an upcoming American zombie comedy thriller film directed by Lin Oeding and written by Peter Gamble Robinson and Ian Shorr. The film stars Brenton Thwaites, Jane Levy, Alan Ritchson, Zachary Levi, and Ian Harding.

The first section of each chapter is in second person, and describes the process the reader goes through to attempt to read the next chapter of the book he is reading. The second half is the first part of a new book that the reader ("you") finds. The second half is always about something different from the previous ones and the ending is never explained. The book was published in an English translation by William Weaver in 1981.

**Question:** In what capacity did the author of the book,  An Inconvenient Truth,  serve in the United States government ? 
**Answer:** Vice President

**Context:**
Richard Haag (born October 23, 1923) is a United States landscape architect. He is famous for his work on Gas Works Park in Seattle, Washington and on the Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island. He is also noted for founding the Landscape Architecture Program at the University of Washington and for holding multiple design awards. His designs call to mind the current trend of being one with and improving the environment. Although Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" is after Richard Haag's heyday, the ideals evoked from the film are shown in his designs. The social movement that created the hybrid car also demanded sustainable design, and Richard Haag provided it in the most distinctive and astounding ways. Richard Haag's modernist and minimalist ideals set the tone for northwestern landscape design and has placed the northwest on the road towards ecologically-minded design. An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American documentary film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens about global warming via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given more than a thousand times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of "The Day After Tomorrow". Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film. An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It is a 2006 book by Al Gore released in conjunction with the film "An Inconvenient Truth". It is published by Rodale Press in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, in the United States. The Yankton Treaty was a treaty signed in 1858 between the United States government and the Yankton Sioux (Nakota) Native American tribe, ceding most of eastern South Dakota to the United States government. The treaty was signed in April 1858, and ratified by the United States Congress on February 17, 1859. The agreement immediately opened this territory up for settlement by whites, resulting in the establishment of an unofficial local government not recognized by Washington. The treaty also created the 400,000 acre Yankton Sioux Reservation, located in present-day Charles Mix County in South Dakota. The Civilian Public Service (CPS) was a program of the United States government that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during World War II. From 1941 to 1947, nearly 12,000 draftees, willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service, accepted assignments in "work of national importance" in 152 CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Draftees from the historic peace churches and other faiths worked in areas such as soil conservation, forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, under the supervision of such agencies as the U.S. Forest Service, the Soil Conservation Service, and the National Park Service. Others helped provide social services and mental health services. The United States Government Manual is the official handbook of the federal government, published annually by the Office of the Federal Register and printed and distributed by the United States Government Printing Office. The first edition was issued in 1935; before the 1973/74 edition it was known as the United States Government Organization Manual. The Missouri Photo Workshop is an annual week-long photojournalism school based in Lee Hills Hall at the Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri. Founded in 1949 by the "Father of Photojournalism" Cliff Edom along with American economist, federal government official, and photographer Roy Stryker and photographer Russell Lee, the workshop originally sought to instruct others in photojournalism based on the "gritty, content-rich photographs" produced by the pre-World War II (pre-1939) Farm Security Administration, a United States government effort during the Great Depression to combat American rural poverty. Following Edom's credo - "Show truth with a camera. Ideally truth is a matter of personal integrity. In no circumstances will a posed or faked photograph be tolerated." - each workshop originates in a different small town in Missouri, which is used as a backdrop for attendees from the United States and other countries to work on photograph storytelling methods such as research, observation, and timing. Missouri Photo Workshop faculty members have included the White House's first photo editor and NPPA Picture Editor of the Year Sandra Eisert and other prominent photojournalists. Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is an American politician and environmentalist who served as the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. Gore was Bill Clinton's running mate in their successful campaign in 1992, and the pair were re-elected in 1996. Near the end of President Clinton's second term, Gore was selected as the Democratic nominee for the 2000 presidential election but did not win the election. After his term as vice-president ended in 2001, Gore remained prominent as an author and environmental activist, whose work in climate change activism earned him (jointly with the IPCC) the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power is a 2017 American documentary film directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk about former United States Vice President Al Gore's continuing mission to battle climate change. The sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth" (2006), the film addresses the progress made to tackle the problem and Gore's global efforts to persuade governmental leaders to invest in renewable energy, culminating in the landmark signing of 2016's Paris Agreement.

**Question:** The Jodrell Bank Observatory was established in 1945 by what English physicist and radio astronomer?
**Answer:** Sir Alfred Charles Bernard Lovell

**Context:**
Stargazing Live is a British live television programme on astronomy that has been broadcast yearly since its first broadcast on BBC Two in January 2011. The series is primarily presented by scientist Brian Cox and comedian and amateur astronomer Dara Ó Briain with support from TV presenter and biochemist Liz Bonnin and astronomer Mark Thompson. It is broadcast from Jodrell Bank Observatory and has featured live links from scientific facilities in Hawaii, South Africa, Norway and NASA. The Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) is an interferometer array of radio telescopes spread across England. The array is run from Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire by the University of Manchester on behalf of Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) as a National Facility. The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, is among the largest astrophysics groups in the UK. It includes the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the MERLIN/VLBI National Facility, and the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre. The Centre was formed after the merger of the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST which brought two astronomy groups together. The Jodrell Bank site also hosts the headquarters of the SKA Organisation (SKAO) - a global entity that is set to become an International Governmental Organisation (IGO). The SKA will be the largest telescope in the world - construction is expected to start at the end of this decade. The Very Small Array (VSA) was a 14-element interferometric radio telescope operating between 26 and 36 GHz that is used to study the cosmic microwave background radiation. It was a collaboration between the University of Cambridge, University of Manchester and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (Tenerife), and was located at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. The array was built at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory by the Cavendish Astrophysics Group and Jodrell Bank Observatory, and was funded by PPARC (now STFC). The design was strongly based on the Cosmic Anisotropy Telescope. The Lovell Telescope is a radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, near Goostrey, Cheshire in the north-west of England. When construction was finished in 1957, the telescope was the largest steerable dish radio telescope in the world at 76.2 m (250 ft) in diameter; The Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (AVO) Project conducted a research and demonstration programme on the scientific requirements and technologies necessary to build a VO for European astronomy. The AVO has been jointly funded by the European Commission (under FP5 - Fifth Framework Programme) with six European organisations participating in a three year Phase-A work programme, valued at 5 million euro. The partner organisations were the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Munich, Germany, the European Space Agency (ESA), AstroGrid (funded by PPARC as part of the UK's E-Science programme), the CNRS-supported Centre de Données Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS), the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France, the CNRS-supported TERAPIX astronomical data centre at the Institut d'Astrophysique in Paris, France, and the Jodrell Bank Observatory of the Victoria University of Manchester, United Kingdom. Roger Clifton Jennison (18 December 1922 – 29 December 2006) worked as a radio astronomer at Jodrell Bank under the guidance of Robert Hanbury Brown. Jennison made a number of discoveries in the field of radio astronomy, including the discovery of the double nature of radio source Cygnus A (3C 405.0) with M K Das Gupta and the mapping of Cassiopeia A with V Latham. Dr Mary Almond, (born 2 January 1928) is an English physicist, radio astronomer, palaeomagnetist, mathematician, and computer scientist who completed an early PhD in radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank Observatory in 1952. Sir Alfred Charles Bernard Lovell, OBE, FRS (31 August 19136 August 2012) was an English physicist and radio astronomer. He was the first Director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, from 1945 to 1980. The Jodrell Bank Observatory (originally the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, then the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories from 1966 to 1999; ) is a British observatory that hosts a number of radio telescopes, and is part of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester. The observatory was established in 1945 by Sir Bernard Lovell, a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester who wanted to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of meteors, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses, and was heavily involved with the tracking of space probes at the start of the Space Age. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington.

The song was an international success, reaching No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 16 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The song also made Double the first Swiss act to hit the Top 40 in the Billboard Hot 100. Double (pronounced "doo-blay") was a Swiss music duo best known for their hit single "The Captain of Her Heart". Blue is the first full-length album from Swiss band Double. In addition to containing updated versions of two of the band's earlier singles ("Woman of the World" and "Rangoon Moon"), the album included the international smash hit, "The Captain of Her Heart", a plaintive, atmospheric, piano-led ballad which was an immediate success throughout Europe upon its 1986 single release. Follow-up singles "Your Prayer Takes Me Off" and "Tomorrow" were less successful. Kurt Maloo (born Kurt Meier, April 16, 1953 in Zurich, Switzerland) is a Swiss singer-songwriter, composer, and record producer. He first achieved international success in 1986, as the singer and front man of the duo Double with the hit single, "The Captain of Her Heart". Parno Graszt is a Roma (i.e. "Gypsy") music ensemble from Paszab, Hungary founded in 1987. "Parno Grast" means "white horse" in the Romany language, with "graszt" using the Hungarian orthography 'sz' for 's'. In the Roma culture white is symbol of purity and horse is a symbol of freedom. Their debut album "Hit the piano" reached Number 7 on the World Music Chart Europe in October 2002. Hungarian Television and the BBC produced in 2004 a music documentary about Parno Graszt. After their second album, "Járom az utam" (2004), Parno Graszt was voted in the top 10 for "best artist of year", 2005, by the Swiss music magazine "Vibrations".

The song reached number 13 on the New Zealand RIANZ list, number 13 on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 65 on the Swiss Music Charts. The song was also featured on the 2002 compilation album "Now That's What I Call Music! 10". Stick Figure Neighbourhood was the first album by the Burlington band Spoons. Released in 1981, it received some airplay on college stations, particularly the songs "Conventional Beliefs" and "Red Light". It was their next album, "Arias & Symphonies", and its best known single, "Nova Heart", that were to launch them to fame. 2005 was a big year for Swiss music, with the charts becoming steadier yet less predictable than they had been in previous years. The year saw many chart debuts from both Swiss and international acts, and saw two novelty songs share a combined total of over ten weeks at the singles chart number one spot. Internationally, the Swiss also saw Vanilla Ninja take the country to their best Eurovision Song Contest position in twelve years.

**Question:** Which town is named after the developers of Monmouth Heights at Manalapan?
**Answer:** Levittown

**Context:**
Monmouth Heights at Marlboro is an unincorporated community located within Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. The housing development was created in the 1960s by Levitt & Sons though some protests occurred by long-time residents of Marlboro Township at the time of its creation. The community is located along New Jersey Route 79 across the highway from Marlboro High School. Sir Augustus Meredith Nanton (7 May 1860 – 24 April 1925) was one of the principal investors and developers of Western Canada, particularly at Winnipeg, Vancouver and Calgary. In the Canadian West, the town of Nanton, Alberta is named for him, and twelve cities and towns have streets named 'Nanton'. Committed to victory in the Great War, he gave over half of his fortune to the war effort and worked himself to an early grave supporting Canadian soldiers in Europe while maintaining Winnipeg's economy. In recognition of his war services he was knighted by George V in 1917 and made a Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He died in office as President of The Dominion Bank in Toronto, but is most closely associated with Winnipeg, his home for over forty years and where he is buried. Elhovo Gap (Elhovska Sedlovina \'el-hov-ska se-dlo-vi-'na\) is a 420 m high saddle extending 1 km in west-southwest–east-northeast direction from Gleaner Heights to Leslie Hill, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica which forms part of the overland route between Bowles Ridge and Vidin Heights. The saddle is named after the Bulgarian town of Elhovo, in association with the artificial Christmas tree ('elha' in Bulgarian) brought by the Tangra 2004/05 Survey team (Lyubomir Ivanov and Doychin Vasilev) to their bivouac at Leslie Hill occupied 24–28 December 2004, making in the process the first crossing of Elhovo Gap. Levitt & Sons was a real estate development company founded by Abraham Levitt and later managed by his son William Levitt. The company is most famous for having built the town of Levittown, New York. The company's designs and building practices totally revolutionized the entire Home Building Industry and altered America's landscape with massive suburban communities. Seven ships of the Royal Navy have been named HMS "Monmouth". Monmouth was the name of a castle and is now the name of a town in Wales; the name also recognises James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, the "Black Duke". The first HMS "Monmouth" was named after the town but whilst the second one was being used the Monmouth Rebellion took place and this caused some concern to the crew. Since that time, all of "Monmouth"s have had their names painted in black and the name and the crest are covered because of the shame of the Duke of Monmouth's execution. Today the officers of the latest HMS "Monmouth" carry black handkerchiefs and the ship is known as the Black Duke. However the town of Monmouth still gives the freedom of the town to the ship's crew and talks of the "enduring link" between the town and the ship. Taylors Mills is an unincorporated community located within Manalapan Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. The main road that runs through the area is named for the community, Taylors Mills Road. Owensmouth, California was a town founded in 1912 in the Western part of the San Fernando Valley. Owensmouth joined the city of Los Angeles in 1917, and was renamed Canoga Park on March 1, 1931. Owensmouth was named for the 1913 Owens River aqueduct's terminus in current Canoga Park. The town was started by the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company as part of an extraordinary real estate development in Southern California. Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company was owned by a syndicate of rich Los Angeles investors, developers, and speculators: including Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Moses Sherman, Hobart Johnstone Whitley, and others. It anticipated possible connections to but was planned independent of the soon to be completed (1913) Los Angeles Aqueduct from the Owens River watershed to the City of Los Angeles through the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County. The newly built Sherman Way double drive and the Pacific Electric street cars, opened on December 7, 1912, gave new access to the town and to the other new towns in the valley Van Nuys (1911) and Marion (now Reseda); Oakland Mills is an unincorporated community located within Manalapan Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. The area is named for Oakland Mill, a mill along the Manalapan Brook operated by the Boo family. Some areas within the Manalapan Brook valley and surround forestland are preserved while the remainder of the area surrounding Oakland Mills has since been developed into housing developments. Monmouth Heights at Manalapan is an unincorporated community located within Manalapan Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States.

**Question:** Augustus Jesse Bowie Jr was the innovator of the switch that was crucial to leading to the passage of which federal legislation in 1936?
**Answer:** Rural Electrification Act

**Context:**
Server-Gated Cryptography (SGC), also known as International Step-Up by Netscape, is a defunct mechanism that was used to step up from 40-bit or 56-bit to 128-bit cipher suites with SSL. It was created in response to United States federal legislation on the export of strong cryptography in the 1990s. The legislation had limited encryption to weak algorithms and shorter key lengths in software exported outside of the United States of America. When the legislation added an exception for financial transactions, SGC was created as an extension to SSL with the certificates being restricted to financial organisations. In 1999, this list was expanded to include online merchants, healthcare organizations, and insurance companies . This legislation changed in January 2000, resulting in vendors no longer shipping export-grade browsers and SGC certificates becoming available without restriction. The Steerage Act of 1819, also called the Manifest of Immigrants Act, was an Act passed by the United States federal government on March 2, 1819, effective January 1, 1820. Its full name is An Act regulating passenger ships and vessels. It was the first law in the United States regulating the conditions of transportation used by people arriving and departing by sea. In addition to regulating conditions in ships, the act also required ship captains to deliver and report a list of passengers with their demographic information to the district collector. The Act was passed near the end of the term of the fifteenth United States Congress and signed into law by then United States President James Monroe. The Act was augmented by many additional Acts starting 1847 and finally repealed and superseded by the Carriage of Passengers Act of 1855. At the time of passage of the Act, the United States had no laws restricting immigration. In fact, the first federal legislation regulating immigration, the Page Act of 1875, was over 50 years in the future. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936, enacted on May 20, 1936, provided federal loans for the installation of electrical distribution systems to serve isolated rural areas of the United States. The Post–Civil Rights era in African-American history is defined as the time period in the United States since Congressional passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the 1968 Fair Housing Act, major federal legislation that ended legal segregation, gained federal oversight and enforcement of voter registration and electoral practices in states or areas with a history of discriminatory practices, and ended discrimination in renting or buying housing. The Federal Interpleader Act of 1936 was United States federal legislation enacted by the 74th United States Congress approved January 20, 1936. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) is United States federal legislation that officially ensured modernized regulation of financial products known as over-the-counter derivatives. It was signed into law on December 21, 2000 by President Bill Clinton. It clarified the law so that most over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transactions between "sophisticated parties" would not be regulated as "futures" under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (CEA) or as "securities" under the federal securities laws. Instead, the major dealers of those products (banks and securities firms) would continue to have their dealings in OTC derivatives supervised by their federal regulators under general "safety and soundness" standards. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) desire to have "Functional regulation" of the market was also rejected. Instead, the CFTC would continue to do "entity-based supervision of OTC derivatives dealers." These derivatives, including the credit default swap, are a few of the many causes of the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent 2008–2012 global recession. The Federal Power Act is a law appearing in Chapter 12 of Title 16 of the United States Code, entitled "Federal Regulation and Development of Power". Enacted as the Federal Water Power Act on June 10, 1920, and amended many times since, its original purpose was to more effectively coordinate the development of hydroelectric projects in the United States. Representative John J. Esch (R-Wisconsin) was the sponsor. Prior to this time and despite federal control of navigable waters and the necessary congressional approval to construct such facilities, Congress had left the regulation of hydroelectric power to the individual states. The first federal legislation broadly dealing with hydroelectric development regarded its competition with navigation usage; with the passage of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 Congress made it illegal to dam navigable streams without a license (or permit) from them. Until 1903, these congressional permits were given away on a 'first come first served' perpetual basis and controlled by the individual states. This would lead to a long debate between competing private and public development interests, and culminate in the act's passage in 1920. Augustus Jesse Bowie Jr. (December 10, 1872 – June 22, 1955, birth name Augustus Jesse Bowie III) was a pioneering American technology engineer, inventor and entrepreneur. His crucial early innovations in large-capacity electrical switches, including the 1000lb. 287Kv disconnecting switch, were important in the early spread of electrification on the West Coast of the United States during the 1910's-1920s, and became essential to the New Deal's mass-scale rural electrification efforts in the 1930s. Bowie was an 1896 graduate of the engineering program at MIT in Boston, and this region of the United States was the locus of innovation in and promulgation of electrification at the time, which was primarily oriented towards centralized urban office/industrial use. Bowie, however, was born and bred in the San Francisco bay area of California, and his mass electrification innovations were put into use in this bustling yet geographically-spread out region first, allowing for the building of an unprecedented electrical grid that would spawn a decentralized regional culture of technological innovation; a region eventually recognized as Silicon Valley. . The General Revision Act (sometimes Land Revision Act) of 1891 was a Federal legislation initiative signed in 1891 under the Presidential Administration of Benjamin Harrison. The General Revision Act of 1891 reversed previous policy initiatives, such as the Timber Culture Act of 1873, in which land fraud was readily accessible on the behalf of wealthy individuals and corporations. The acquisition of vast mineral and timber resources in the western United States was often cited as a governing motive for such individuals and corporations to claim land rights for future settlement and resource depletion activities, The General Revision Act of 1891's legacy is frequently credited by its ability to catalyze a series of federal land reform initiatives, notably under the Presidential Administration of Theodore Roosevelt. From the Reclamation Act of 1902 to the formation of the United States Forest Service in 1905, the General Revision Act of 1891 acted as a critical first piece of federal legislation granting increased plots of publicly allotted land and decreased extraction rights to privately held western land owners within the early stages of the 20th century. The Math Science Teaching Corps Act of 2006 (or MSTC, pronounced "mystic") is legislation based on nonprofit Math for America's (MƒA's) Programs, the MƒA Fellowship and the MƒA Master Teacher Program. The bill was introduced in the 109th Congress by Charles Schumer in the Senate as S. 2248 and by Jim Saxton in the House as H.R. 4705. The MSTC legislation creates a National Science Foundation Fellowship Program to recruit, train, and retain outstanding math and science teachers. MƒA is engaged in an advocacy campaign to move forward federal legislation based on MSTC principles.

**Question:** What continents are the Moneuptychia found in?
**Answer:** the Americas

**Context:**
The Holarctic is the name for the biogeographic realm that encompasses the majority of habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world, combining Wallace's Palearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North Africa and all of Eurasia (with the exception of the southern Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent), and the Nearctic zoogeographical region, consisting of North America, north of Mexico. These regions are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions. Many ecosystems, and the animal and plant communities that depend on them, are found across multiple continents in large portions of this realm. The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of the realm. The floristic Boreal Kingdom corresponds to the Holarctic realm. Uvala is originally a local toponym used by people in some regions in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. In geosciences it denotes a closed karst depression, a terrain form usually of elongated or compound structure and of larger size than that of sinkholes (dolines). It is a morphological form frequently found in the “Outer Dinarides” anywhere between Slovenia and Greece. But large closed karst depressions are found on all continents in different landscapes and therefore uvala has become a globally established term, used also to distinguish such depressions from poljes (size of many km). Definitions of uvalas are often poorly empirically supported. “The coalescence of dolines” is a most frequently found and still dominant explanation. Yet because of the ongoing dissatisfaction with this definition the term ‘uvala’ has often been belittled – occasionally it was even proposed that the term be given up altogether. Moneuptychia is a genus of satyrid butterflies found in the Neotropical realm. Palms are symbolically important in the Caribbean, appearing on the coats of arms of several Caribbean nations and on the flag of the West Indies cricket team. In 2004, Morici reported that there are about 191 genera and 2339 species of Arecaceae, the palm family. Their distribution is biased toward islands - 36% of genera and 52% of species are found only on islands, while 32% of genera and 6% of species are found only on continents. Sixty-two percent of monotypic genera are found only on islands. Neoscona arabesca is a common orb-weaver spider found throughout the United States and Canada. Often called the "arabesque orbweaver," after the cryptic, brightly-colored, swirling markings on its prominent abdomen, this spider can be found in fields, forests, gardens, and on human structures. "Neoscona" species are among the most common and abundant orb weavers and are found on all continents. Females range in size from 5-7 mm and males 5-6 mm . A paleocontinent or palaeocontinent is a distinct area of continental crust that existed as a major landmass in the geological past. There have been many different landmasses throughout Earth’s time. They range in sizes, some are just a collection of small microcontinents while others are large conglomerates of crust. As time progresses and sea levels rise and fall more crust can be exposed making way for larger landmasses. The continents of the past shaped the evolution of organisms on Earth and contributed to the climate of the globe as well. As land masses break apart species are separated and that were once the same now have evolved to their new climate. The constant movement of these landmasses greatly determines the distribution of organisms on the Earth’s surface. This is evident with how similar fossils are found on completely separate continents. Also, as continents move, mountain building events (orogenies) occur, causing a shift in the global climate as new rock is exposed and then there is more exposed rock at higher elevations. This causes glacial ice expansion and an overall cooler global climate. Which effects the overall global climate trend of the Earth. The movement of the continents greatly affects the overall dispersal of organisms throughout the world and the trend in climate throughout the Earth’s history. Examples include Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia, which collided together during the Caledonian orogeny to form the Old Red Sandstone paleocontinent of Laurussia. Another example includes a collision that occurred during the late Pennsylvanian and early Permian time when there was a collision between the two continents of Tarimsky and Kirghiz-Kazakh. This collision was caused because of their askew convergence when the paleoceanic basin closed. Anomobryum julaceum, the slender silver-moss, is a species of bryophyte native to all continents except South America and Antarctica. "A. julaceum" is found widespread in the temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Its capsules mature beginning in late fall and through the spring. It is most commonly found in wet crevices and on sandstone cliffs. Additional micro-habitats include tussock tundra with seeps and late snow melt areas and on grantic outcrops. In eastern North America it appears to be restricted to acid habitats, in the wet crevices of sandstone cliffs or other seepy niches. Overall, "A. julaceum" resembles species of the genus "Pohlia", and its leaves are similar to those of "Bryum argenteum"; it can only be separated from "Pohlia" and "Bryum" using a microscope. "Anomobryum julaceum" can be distinguished from "Bryum argenteum" by its strongly julaceous, shiny leaves. The Neotropical realm is one of the eight biogeographic realms constituting the Earth's land surface. Physically, it includes the tropical terrestrial ecoregions of the Americas and the entire South American temperate zone. Rhytachne is a genus of plants in the grass family. They grow principally in wet savannahs in Africa and the Americas. More specifically, they tend to prefer transitional zones between marshes and drier upland savannahs. In the Americas the genus can be found from southern Mexico and Cuba south to northern Argentina, while in Africa it is present below the Sahara, including in Madagascar. Twelve species are included, of which nine are African, two are American, and one, "Rhytachne subgibbosa", is found on both continents. The genus is closely related to "Coelorachis". Cyclosorus interruptus, the swamp shield-fern, is a fern in the family Thelypteridaceae, that is native to the tropics and subtropics of all the continents. In the New World, it is found from Mexico to Argentina, and in the Antilles. In the Old World, it is found in India, China, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and South Africa. It is also found in Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii and other islands in the Pacific Ocean. The various populations differ with respect to genetic cytotypes, glands, pubescence, and frond size. Its habitat is the vicinity of freshwater swamps and it may reach 1 m in height.

**Question:** What was the original name of the theatrical program that was founded by Joseph Papp? 
**Answer:** New York Shakespeare Festival

**Context:**
Joseph "Joe" Papp (June 22, 1921 – October 31, 1991) was an American theatrical producer and director. He established The Public Theater in what had been the Astor Library Building in lower Manhattan. There, Papp created a year-round producing home to focus on new plays and musicals. Among numerous examples of these were the works of David Rabe, Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf", Charles Gordone's "No Place to Be Somebody" (the first off-Broadway play to win the Pulitzer Prize), and Papp's production of Michael Bennett's Pulitzer Prize–winning musical, "A Chorus Line". Papp also founded Shakespeare in the Park, helped to develop other off-Broadway theatres and worked to preserve the historic Broadway Theatre District. The Sound of a Voice is a 1983 play by American playwright David Henry Hwang. Hwang's fifth play, it is an original ghost story inspired by Japanese folk stories, films, and Noh theater. The play was first produced as part of the production "Sound and Beauty" on November 6, 1983 Off-Broadway at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. It was directed by and featured John Lone. The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding (FFEU) is a not-for-profit organization based in New York that focuses on improving Muslim–Jewish relations and black–Jewish relations. FFEU was founded in 1989 by Rabbi Marc Schneier and theatrical producer and director Joseph Papp. The goals of the organization are in part motivated by the historical cooperation between African Americans and Jewish Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. Russell Simmons joined the Board of the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding in 2002 as Chairman of the Board. In 2007, the Foundation began its program in Muslim–Jewish Relations and has since hosted the First National Summit of Imams and Rabbis, two European conferences of Muslim and Jewish Leaders, three Missions of Muslim and Jewish Leaders to Washington D.C., and has held the annual program "The Weekend of Twinning" each November since 2008. Shakespeare in the Park (or Free Shakespeare in the Park) is a theatrical program that stages productions of Shakespearean plays at the Delacorte Theater, an open-air theater in New York City's Central Park. The theater and the productions are managed by the Public Theater and tickets are distributed free of charge on the day of the performance. Originally branded as the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) under the direction of Joseph Papp, the institution was renamed in 2002 as part of a larger reorganization by the Public Theater. More Than You Deserve is a musical written by Jim Steinman and Michael Weller, produced by Joseph Papp and directed by Kim Friedman. It opened at The Public Theater on November 21, 1973, ran for 63 performances and closed on January 13, 1974. Weller's original title for the play was "Souvenirs", which referred to the severed ears of killed Viet Cong forces which the soldiers collected and wore as keepsakes on strings around their necks. He was irate when the title was changed to "More Than You Deserve". Joe's Pub, one of the six performance spaces within The Public Theater, is a music venue and restaurant that hosts live performances across genres and arts, ranging from cabaret to modern dance to world music. Joe's Pub is located at 425 Lafayette Street near Astor Place in Manhattan, New York City. It is named after Joseph Papp, the theatrical producer who established the New York Shakespeare Festival, The Public Theater and the free Shakespeare in the Park program in Central Park. The Pirates of Penzance is a 1983 British-American romantic musical comedy film written and directed by Wilford Leach based on Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera of the same name. The film, starring Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury, Linda Ronstadt, George Rose, and Rex Smith, is an adaptation of the 1980 Joseph Papp production of "Pirates". The original Broadway cast reprised their roles in the film, except that Lansbury replaced Estelle Parsons as Ruth. The minor roles used British actors miming to their Broadway counterparts. Choreography was by Graciela Daniele. It was produced by Papp and filmed at Shepperton Studios in London. Organic Theater Company, a Chicago theatre, was founded in 1969 in Madison, Wisconsin by artistic director Stuart Gordon and his wife Carolyn Purdy Gordon. Its first play was a production of "Richard III" but harassment from the local officials of Madison caused the production to be moved to three different venues before closing. In 1970 at the invitation of Paul Sills, Organic moved to Chicago where Sills helped the theater find a home in the Holy Covenant Church where they produced original adaptations of George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and Homer's "Odyssey". When Sills took his production of Story Theater to Los Angeles that summer he invited Organic to produce at his Body Politic Theater on Lincoln Avenue. The company ended up staying there over three years where it produced "Candide" which was invited by Joseph Papp to the Public Theater in New York. They also produced "Poe" by playwright Stephen Most and "Warp! " by Stuart Gordon and Bury St. Edmund aka Lenny Kleinfeld, an original science-fiction epic adventure in three parts. " Warp! " was produced on Broadway at the Ambassador Theater in 1973. Curse of the Starving Class is a play by Sam Shepard, considered the first of a series on family tragedies. Some critics consider it part of a Family Trilogy that includes "Buried Child" (1979) and "True West" (1980). Others consider it part of a quintet that includes "Fool for Love" (1983) and "A Lie of the Mind" (1985). The play was commissioned by Joseph Papp and premiered in London in 1977 before playing at Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival in 1978. Eulalie Spence (June 11, 1894 – March 7, 1981) was a black writer, teacher, director, actress and playwright from the British West Indies. She was an influential member of the Harlem Renaissance, writing fourteen plays, at least five of which were published. Spence, who described herself as a "folk dramatist" who made plays for fun and entertainment, was considered one of the most experienced female playwrights before the 1950s, and received more recognition than other black playwrights of the Harlem Renaissance period, winning several competitions. She presented several plays with W.E.B. Du Bois' Krigwa Players, of which she was a member from 1926 to 1928. Spence was also a mentor to theatrical producer Joseph Papp, founder of The Public Theater and the accompanying festival currently known as Shakespeare in the Park.

**Question:** What town in Piscataquis County, Maine, housed the smallest railroad in the United States in 1890?
**Answer:** Monson, Maine

**Context:**
Northwest Piscataquis is an unorganized territory in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 159 at the 2000 census. Guilford is a town in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The town is located on the Piscataquis River and was first settled in 1806. The population was 1,521 at the 2010 census. Southeast Piscataquis, also known as Orneville, is an unorganized territory (township) in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 254 at the 2000 census. Maine School Administrative District 68 (often known as MSAD68) consists of two public schools in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. The district serves the towns of Dover-Foxcroft, Monson, Sebec, Charleston, and smaller communities. Students are often bussed in from these outlying towns. It is the largest of four school districts in Piscataquis County. Dover-Foxcroft has since become a hub for MSAD 68, as Monson was the final town outside Dover-Foxcroft to have a school in the district until the end of the 2008–2009 school year, when Monson Elementary was closed due to declining enrollment. The building that once housed Monson Elementary has now become the Monson Center. Monson is a town in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 686 at the 2010 census. The town is located on Route 15 which is a somewhat major route north to the well known Moosehead Lake Region, to which Monson is sometimes considered a gateway. This route ultimately leads to the Canadian Province of Quebec. Northeast Piscataquis is an unorganized territory in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 347 at the 2000 census. Askwith is a ghost town located in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. Between the towns of Greenville and Rockwood, specifically near Misery Knob, the town had at one time a post office. In 1895 there were no post offices, nor were there express offices; however there was a railroad. Askwith has since been renamed to 'Tarratine' and discontinued as a railroad station. The railroad that once ran through it has been converted into an ATV trail. The Monson Railroad was a narrow gauge railway, which operated between Monson Junction on the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad and Monson, Maine. The primary purpose of this railroad was to serve several slate mines and finishing houses in Monson. According to the Scientific American of May 17, 1890, it was the smallest railroad in the United States. WSYY-FM (94.9 FM) is a radio station broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week (from 4:55AM through 11:10PM ET) under the slogan, ""Radio With An Attitude"". Playing a mix of oldies/classic hits, adult contemporary, rock music, and some country crossovers, the station broadcasts an Adult Hits/Full-Service format for approximately 16 hours per day, from 6:00AM through 10:00PM ET (reserving the first and, also, the final hour of their broadcast day to "When Radio Was"). "The Mountain 94.9" carries local high school sports in season. "The Mountain 94.9" had also carried the complete schedule of Red Sox Baseball (from 1997 through 2015, prior to becoming a Former Affiliate in 2016, which was when Millinocket's affiliation with the Red Sox Baseball would ultimately be transferred over to co-owned WSYY-AM, thus concluding the frequent interruptions to the music on "The Mountain 94.9" during Baseball season). The station currently features programming from CBS Radio and carries CBS Radio News at the top of every hour (and has been an affiliate of that network for many decades). Licensed to Millinocket, Maine, United States, the station's broadcast signal serves the Central Penobscot County, Eastern Piscataquis County, and Southern Aroostook County Maine areas, and the station is licensed to serve the town of Millinocket, Maine, the very town where its studios/offices and tower site are located. The station is currently owned by Katahdin Communications, Inc. WSYY-FM originally went on the air in 1978 on 97.7 FM as WKTR, upgrading to its current facilities in 1984 on 94.9. Prior to their "The Mountain 94.9" branding, WSYY-FM used to be referred to as "North Country 95", airing a full-time Country Music format. The current format, branding, and slogan was probably adopted around March 1, 2004, when Katahdin Communications, Inc. assumed control of WSYY-FM & WSYY-AM from Katahdin Timberlands, LLC (as a result of the radio station facing increasing land disputes), initially as a short term lease agreement but the transfer of ownership ultimately became permanent. Those same land disputes would eventually lead to a loss of WSYY-FM's 23,500 watt transmitter location (featuring an antenna HAAT of 211 meters); as a result, WSYY-FM may have been operating under a Special Temporary Authority License (a 12,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 68 meters via Hammond Ridge on Lake Road, about two miles from Millinocket Municipal Airport), ever since as long ago as late 2007, pending a planned permanent move to a 22,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 198.4 meters (from just off Nicatou Road in Medway, well east of WSYY-FM's old or current transmitter tower location). On November 23th, 2016, the CP for this proposed move was modified to a 45,000 watt facility with an antenna HAAT of 146.7 meters, the first time this proposed move has ever received official approval from the FCC. WSYY-FM is one of the two Maine affiliates—apart from WLOB—of When Radio Was (7 days a week from 5:00AM through 6:00AM ET and also from 10:00PM through 11:00PM ET), is one of the two Maine affiliates (WWMJ) of The Acoustic Storm (Saturdays from 9:00AM through 12:00PM ET), is Maine's only affiliate of the Crook & Chase syndicated Country Music countdown programming (Sunday afternoons from 2:00PM through 6:00PM ET), and is an affiliate of the Blues Deluxe radio show. WSYY-FM/WSYY-AM are unusual in that while these stations are authorized to broadcast 24 hours a day, the stations both have sign-offs every day (WSYY-AM signing off at sun-down, broadcasting only on Weekends (but not between Monday-through-Friday) and WSYY-FM broadcasting for approximately 18¼ hours per day, 7 days a week, WSYY-FM's broadcast day concluding with the 11:00PM ET Top-of-the-Hour CBS Radio newscast and then a Nightly Sign-Off Announcement and then an instrumentation of the American national anthem, followed by Dead Air amidst a Transmitter Power-Down, not Signing Back Onto The Air until 4:55AM ET). In Old Town and also Bangor (and continuing southward and/or southwestward), the station has strong FM co-channel interference with Portland-market WHOM (which transmits from atop Mount Washington in New Hampshire, the tallest peak in the Northeast and had for a long time claimed on its website that it has the largest coverage area of any FM station in the United States, its signal spanning five states: NH, ME, VT, MA, NY and also parts of Southern Quebec Province, Canada), this matter being especially problematic before dawn or after dusk. In favorable atmospheric conditions, a very weak signal of WHOM can be DX-ed in Millinocket during overnight hours (when WSYY-FM is off-the-air). The Piscataquis River is a major tributary of the Penobscot River, found in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. It starts from the confluence of its East Branch and West Branch ( ) in Blanchard. The river flows in a mostly eastern direction until it meets the Penobscot at Howland. It is approximately 65 mi in length.

**Question:** Do Czesław Miłosz and Nathalie Sarraute have the same nationality?
**Answer:** no

**Context:**
Polish literature is the literary tradition of Poland. Most Polish literature has been written in the Polish language, though other languages used in Poland over the centuries have also contributed to Polish literary traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, German and Esperanto. According to Czesław Miłosz, for centuries Polish literature focused more on drama and poetic self-expression than on fiction (dominant in the English speaking world). The reasons were manifold, but mostly rested on historical circumstances of the nation. Polish writers typically have had a more profound range of choices to motivate them to write, including historical cataclysms of extraordinary violence that swept Poland (as the crossroads of Europe); but also, Poland's own collective incongruities demanding adequate reaction from the writing communities of any given period. Orfeusz i Eurydyka is a poetry collection by Czesław Miłosz. It was first published in 2003. Nathalie Sarraute (] ; July 18, 1900 – October 19, 1999) was a French lawyer and writer. Czesław Miłosz ( ; 30 June 1911 – 14 August 2004) was a Polish poet, prose writer, translator and diplomat. His World War II-era sequence "The World" is a collection of twenty "naïve" poems. Following the war, he served as Polish cultural attaché in Paris and Washington, D.C., then in 1951 defected to the West. His nonfiction book "The Captive Mind" (1953) became a classic of anti-Stalinism. From 1961 to 1998 he was a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of California, Berkeley. He became a U.S. citizen in 1970. In 1978 he was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature, and in 1980 the Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1999 he was named a Puterbaugh Fellow. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, he divided his time between Berkeley, California, and Kraków, Poland. Robert Pinsky (born October 20, 1940) is an American poet, essayist, literary critic, and translator. From 1997 to 2000, he served as Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. Pinsky is the author of nineteen books, most of which are collections of his poetry. His published work also includes critically acclaimed translations, including "The Inferno" of Dante Alighieri and "The Separate Notebooks" by Czesław Miłosz. He teaches at Boston University. Druga przestrzen is a poetry collection by Czesław Miłosz. It was first published in 2002. Lynn O'Donnell (died 1996) was an independent film producer, whose works included the award-winning "Crumb", "Living on Tokyo Time", and a number of specials made for America public television, including films on Nobel Laureate Czesław Miłosz and Argentinian tango superstar Carlos Gardel. To is a literary work, whose Polish title could be translated to "It", by Czesław Miłosz. It was first published in 2000. Wiersze ostatnie ("Last poems") is a poetry collection by Czesław Miłosz. It was first published in 2006. The Captive Mind (Polish: Zniewolony umysł ) is a 1953 work of nonfiction by Polish writer, academic and Nobel laureate Czesław Miłosz, published in the English translation originally by Secker and Warburg. The work was written in Polish soon after the author received political asylum in Paris following his break with Poland's Communist government. It draws upon his experiences as an underground writer during World War II, and his position within the political and cultural elite of Poland in the immediate post-war years. The book attempts to explain both the intellectual allure of Stalinism and the temptation of collaboration with the Stalinist regime among intellectuals in post-war Central and Eastern Europe. Miłosz describes the book as having been written "under great inner conflict".

**Question:** What writer worked on both The Ice Cream Man and and a 2007 fantasy comedy loosely based on a Donald Henkel poem?
**Answer:** David Dobkin

**Context:**
Ice Cream Man is the fifth studio album by New Orleans rapper Master P. It was set to be released in the summer of '95 after he signed a deal with Priority. He released it in the spring of '96. It was released on April 16, 1996. "Ice Cream Man" was placed at No. 6 on the "Billboard"'s R&B Albums and No. 26 on the "Billboard" 200. It was Master P's and No Limit Record's first ever RIAA platinum certified album. The track "The Ghetto Won't Change" was not included on the 2005 re-issue. As of 2009, the album has sold 1,640,000 copies in the United States. Rocky road ice cream is a chocolate flavored ice cream. Though there are variations from the original flavor, it is traditionally composed of chocolate ice cream, nuts, and whole or diced marshmallows. According to one source, the flavor was created in March 1929 by William Dreyer in Oakland, California when he cut up walnuts and marshmallows with his wife's sewing scissors and added them to his chocolate ice cream in a manner that reflected how his partner Joseph Edy's chocolate candy creation incorporated walnuts and marshmallow pieces. Later, the walnuts would be replaced by pieces of toasted almond. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Dreyer and Edy gave the flavor its current name "to give folks something to smile about in the midst of the Great Depression." Alternatively, Fentons Creamery in Oakland claims that William Dreyer based his recipe on a Rocky Road-style ice cream flavor invented by his friend, Fentons' George Farren, who blended his own Rocky Road-style candy bar into ice cream; however, Dreyer substituted almonds for walnuts. Fred Claus is a 2007 American fantasy comedy family film directed by David Dobkin, written by Dan Fogelman and Jessie Nelson, and starring Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti.

**Question:** The younger brother, who became king, of Princess Mafalda of Savoy reigned for how many days?
**Answer:** 34 days

**Context:**
Sen Soulintha, Saen Surintha or Sen Sourintha (1511–1582) was born Chane Tian and became King of Lan Xang reigning 1571-1575 and again 1580-1582. Sen Soulintha was not of noble birth, rising from royal page to King Setthatirath’s Chief Minister. During the succession disputes in the Kingdom of Lan Na between King Setthatirath and King Mekuti, Sen Soulintha served Setthatirath as a general and successfully took several cities of Lan Na including Chiang Saen for which he was given the honorific name "Lusai" meaning “victory.” Sen Soulintha supported Setthatirath in leading the guerrilla campaigns during the Burmese invasions of King Bayinnaung. When Setthatirath died near Attapeu under suspicious circumstances in 1572, Sen Soulintha led the armies of Lan Xang back to Vientiane. A succession dispute erupted, which nearly led to civil war and provided a pretext for another Burmese invasion ordered by Bayinnaung and led by the Chief Minister Binnya Dala. Sen Soulintha defeated the Burmese and Lan Na forces led by Binnya Dala, an event which led to the latter’s exile, only to face a more massive invasion led by Bayinnaug the following year. Sen Soulintha again attempted to resort to guerilla tactics, but lacked popular support from his seizure of the throne. He and his son Ong Lo (Nakhon Noi) were captured by Bayinnaung and exiled to Pegu. The Burmese placed Setthathirath’s brother, and former "Ouphahat" or Viceroy, Prince Tha Heua on the throne. According to the Luang Prabang chronicles it was this brother, who had led a rebellion in Luang Prabang and tried to seize the throne from Setthathirath on the death of their father Photisarath. Prince Tha Heua took the regnal name Voravongsa and reigned under Burmese suzerainty from 1575-1579. Voravongsa was never popular, and drowned with his family while attempting to flee Vientiane in the face of popular uprising. In 1579, Bayinnaung dispatched a sizable army to restore order. According to Lao histories Sen Soulintha was then installed as king a second time in 1580.

First married by proxy to Charles of Lorraine in 1662, Lorraine soon refused to recognise the union and it was annulled. She married Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy in 1665 who was her kinsman. The mother of the future Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia who saw the elevation of the House of Savoy to kings, she styled herself as Madama Reale or Madame Royale. She acted as Regent of Savoy from 1675 in the name of her son Victor Amadeus II, who was her husband's successor. Her regency officially ended in 1680, but she maintained power until her son banished her from further influence in the state in 1684. She left a considerable architectural legacy in Turin, and was responsible for the remodelling of the Palazzo Madama, which was her private residence. At the time of her death she was the mother of the King of Sardinia as well as great grandmother of two other kings, Louis I of Spain and Louis XV of France.

**Question:** Do Bloody Mary and Sidecar share any ingredients in common?
**Answer:** no

**Context:**
Agent 077: Mission Bloody Mary or Agente 077: Missione Bloody Mary is a 1965 Italian action spy adventure film. The first of the Secret Agent 077 film series directed by Sergio Grieco. A Bacon Martini, also known as bacontini, pig on the tocks or a bloody bacon martini, is a cocktail that consists of bacon-infused vodka served with a garnish that can include strips of bacon, bacon bits, or olives. Variants may include the addition of Bloody Mary mix. Although not a vodka martini, which consists of vodka and vermouth, the term "bacon martini" is consistent with the trend of calling any straight liquor in a martini glass a "martini," such as the saketini or other variations. "Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)", often referred to as just "Bloody Mary", is an indie rock song performed by American alternative rock music group Silversun Pickups. The song was written by Silversun Pickups, and produced by Jacknife Lee. It serves as the lead-off single to their third studio album, "Neck of the Woods", which was released on May 8, 2012. The song reached the top ten of the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart in May 2012, peaking at number seven in June. "Bloody Mary Morning" is a song written by American country music singer-songwriter Willie Nelson. Nelson wrote the song inspired by his struggles to become a "better parent". It was originally released in the 1970 RCA Records release "Both Sides Now" with the title "Bloody Merry Morning". A Caesar is a cocktail created and primarily consumed in Canada. It typically contains vodka, a caesar mix (a blend of tomato juice and clam broth), hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, and is served with ice in a large, celery salt-rimmed glass, typically garnished with a stalk of celery and wedge of lime. What distinguishes it from a Bloody Mary is the inclusion of clam broth. The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka. Bloody Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost, phantom, or spirit conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called three times. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation play. The Bloody Mary Show is a multi-award-winning British comedy web series produced and written by director Darren Chadwick-Hussein. The series is broadcast on the internet and premiered on September 7, 2012. So far, seven episodes of season one have been made, with season two currently under development. The show can be found distributed across the web including on Blip and YouTube. The Bloody Mary Show follows a group of unconventional ghouls, who can be summoned from the afterlife by the living or are sent to haunt them. The show focuses on main character Bloody Mary and her friends, Abdabs, Malevolent and Viscera, as they spend their days haunting the living, sharing their experiences and drinking at an underworld bar called Hemingway's, which was filmed in the oldest pub on the River Thames, 'The Mayflower.' Typhoon Mary, also nicknamed "Bloody Mary" by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), was an extremely damaging storm that was part of the 1960 Pacific typhoon season. It began as a circulation in a trough in the South China Sea. A tropical depression formed on June 2, as it was traveling clockwise. It became a tropical storm on the next day, and received the name "Mary". It slowly moved across the sea, strengthening to a typhoon. Mary made landfall in Hong Kong on June 8, and moved through Guangdong and Fujian. It reemerged back to the Pacific Ocean, and restrengthened into a typhoon temporarily. It then traveled east, weakening and becoming extratropical on June 12. The sidecar is a cocktail traditionally made with cognac, orange liqueur (Cointreau, Grand Marnier, Grand Gala or another triple sec), and lemon juice. In its ingredients, the drink is perhaps most closely related to the older brandy crusta, which differs both in presentation and in proportions of its components. A Bloody Mary is a cocktail containing vodka, tomato juice, and combinations of other spices and flavorings including Worcestershire sauce, Hot Sauce, piri piri sauce, beef consommé or bouillon, horseradish, celery, olives, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, lime juice and/or celery salt.

It begins with Walt Disney showing viewers and Disneyland ambassador Julie Reihm plans for upcoming attractions, including It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion. In Disneyland, the Disney characters celebrate Disneyland’s Tencennial, with a show in front of the Sleeping Beauty Castle and a parade put on by a local high school band and cheerleaders. Next, Walt Disney describes a brief history of the construction of the park, followed by a tour of some of the attractions at the time, including Matterhorn Bobsleds, Jungle Cruise, the Flying Saucers, the Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland and the Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room. The climax of the episode is a Dixieland band on the Mark Twain Riverboat, and some other boats on the Rivers of America put on an interesting water show. Roller coaster phobia is a colloquial and slang term describing an individual's fear of roller coasters. While roller coasters are the most popular theme park attraction, certain people feel nauseated, afraid, dizzy, or unsafe when riding roller coasters. In the majority of cases, this fear is related to acrophobia, claustrophobia, or a traumatic event. Roller coaster phobia can be overcome relatively easily, the best cure being going on the tallest/fastest roller coaster before riding roller coasters of a lesser magnitude. Roller coaster phobia has been linked to previously experiencing an accident, vertigo, and fear of heights. In rare cases, riders may be afraid of roller coasters due to a painful ride, tight restraints, being thrown around in the restraints, and excessive g-forces on the body of the rider. Robert Henry "Bob" Gurr (born October 25, 1931 in Los Angeles, California) is an American amusement ride designer and Imagineer. His most famous work was for Walt Disney's Disneyland Park, and its subsequent sister parks. Gurr is said to have designed most, if not all, of the ride vehicles of the Disneyland attractions, including Autopia, Haunted Mansion, the Disneyland Monorail, the Submarine Voyage, and the Matterhorn Bobsleds. He was named a Disney Legend in 2004. He also worked on the King Kong Encounter animatronic for Universal Studios Hollywood. The Submarine Voyage was an attraction at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. The attraction, which featured ride vehicles designed to resemble submarines, opened on June 14, 1959, as one of the first rides to require an E ticket. It was part of a major expansion of Tomorrowland and Fantasyland, which also included the Matterhorn Bobsleds roller coaster, an expanded version of Autopia, the Disneyland Monorail, and the Motor Boat Cruise. The Submarine Voyage closed on September 9, 1998; at that time, it was reported that the attraction would reopen with a new theme by 2003, but that did not occur. The attraction ultimately reopened in June 2007 themed to Disney·Pixar's "Finding Nemo", and now operates as Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage. The Matterhorn Bobsleds are a pair of intertwined steel roller coasters at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. It is modelled after the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Alps on the border with Switzerland and Italy. It is the first known tubular steel continuous track roller coaster. Located on the border between Tomorrowland and Fantasyland, it employs forced perspective to seem more impressively large. Third Man on the Mountain is a 1959 American Walt Disney Productions film set during the golden age of alpinism about a young Swiss man who conquers the mountain that killed his father. It is based on "Banner in the Sky", a James Ramsey Ullman novel about the first ascent of the Citadel, and was televised under this name. The movie inspired the Matterhorn Bobsleds attraction at Disneyland Park. Arrow Dynamics was a roller coaster design and manufacturing company based in Clearfield, Utah, United States. Successor to Arrow Development (1946–1981) and Arrow Huss (1981–1986), which were responsible for some of the most influential advancements in the amusement and theme park industries. Among the most significant was tubular steel track, which provided a smoother ride than the railroad style rails commonly used prior to the 1960s on wooden roller coasters. The Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disneyland was Arrow's first foray into roller coasters, in 1959. Arrow and their successors would continue to build trend-setting ride systems for the next 45 years.

Despite its length, White Cyclone is still considerably shorter than the 2479 m Steel Dragon 2000, the world's longest steel roller coaster, which is also at Nagashima Spa Land. In addition to being the third longest wooden roller coaster, White Cyclone is the seventh tallest wooden roller coaster in the world and the fourth tallest wooden roller coaster outside the United States. A single ride on the White Cyclone costs ¥1,000 (approximately $9 USD), and the ride is restricted to those individuals above 1.3 m in height; and those individuals under 54 years of age. Autopia is a Disneyland attraction, in which patrons steer specially designed cars through an enclosed track.

There was also an Autopia at Hong Kong Disneyland on Lantau Island, Hong Kong before it closed on June 11, 2016. Other versions of the attraction can be found at the Magic Kingdom as the Tomorrowland Speedway and formerly at Tokyo Disneyland as the Grand Circuit Raceway. Kings Island is a 364 acre theme park located in Mason, Ohio, 24 mi northeast of Cincinnati. Since the opening of the amusement park in 1972, at least one attraction has been added every year except 1978, 1980, 1983, and 2008. The park is known to have attractions such as Flight of Fear which was the world's first linear induction motor launched roller coaster, and The Beast which has held the record for the world's longest wooden roller coaster since its opening in 1979.

While Glasgow's novels receive more critical attention, scholarship on her stories continues into the twenty-first century. Virginia (1913) is a novel by Ellen Glasgow about a wife and mother who in vain seeks happiness by serving her family. This novel, her eleventh, marked a clear departure from Glasgow's previous work—she had written a series of bestsellers before publishing "Virginia"—in that it attacked, in a subtle yet unmistakable way, the very layer of society that constituted her readership. Also, as its heroine, though virtuous and god-fearing, is denied the happiness she is craving, its plot did not live up to readers' expectations as far as poetic justice is concerned and was bound to upset some of them. Today, "Virginia" is seen by many as an outstanding achievement in Glasgow's career, exactly because the author defied literary convention by questioning the foundations of American society around the dawn of the 20th century, be it capitalism, religion or racism. Robert Weil is the Editor-in-Chief and Publishing Director of Liveright, a newly relaunched division of W.W. Norton & Company. Over the course of his career, “Weil has published six National Book Award winners and three National Book Award finalists. He's published sixteen Pulitzer Prize winners (Michael Dirda, N. Scott Momaday, and Tina Rosenberg among them); seven Bancroft history prize winners; [and] seven MacArthur fellowship winners.” The Native American Renaissance is a term originally coined by critic Kenneth Lincoln in the 1983 book "Native American Renaissance" to categorise the significant increase in production of literary works by Native Americans in the United States in the late 1960s and onwards. A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title "quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of N. Scott Momaday's "House Made of Dawn" in 1968". Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1969.

**Question:** How many albums have been sold by the band who was supported by Iron Maiden on their World Wide Blitz Tour?
**Answer:** close to 50 million

**Context:**
Iron Maiden are a British heavy metal band, founded in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris in London, England. After several personnel changes in the 1970s, the band settled on a lineup of Harris, Paul Di'Anno (lead vocals), Dave Murray (lead and rhythm guitars), Dennis Stratton (backing vocals, lead and rhythm guitar) and Clive Burr (drums), before they set out on their first professional tour, the Metal for Muthas Tour which supported the compilation album of the same name. After taking on a supporting slot with Judas Priest on their British Steel Tour and setting out on their own headline tour in support of their debut album, "Iron Maiden", the band supported Kiss on the European leg of their Unmasked Tour, following which Stratton was dismissed because of musical differences. Guitarist Adrian Smith was hired, following which Iron Maiden set out on a short series of UK dates before recording their second studio album, "Killers". Eddie Rips Up the World Tour was a concert tour by Iron Maiden in 2005 based on bringing back rarities from the first four Iron Maiden albums for the younger audience ("Iron Maiden", "Killers", "The Number of the Beast" and "Piece of Mind"), brought about by the band's 2004 DVD "". Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1969. The band have sold close to 50 million albums to date. They are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferent record production, repeated changes of drummer and lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album "British Steel", which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. In 1989, they were named as defendants in an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging that subliminal messages on the song "Better By You, Better Than Me" had caused the suicide attempts of two young men. The Iron Maiden Tour was a 1980 concert tour by Iron Maiden in support of their eponymous debut album. The band's first solo headlining tour, it followed the co-headlined Metal for Muthas Tour from earlier in the same year. The tour commenced with a British leg from 1 April to 23 August, although this included one concert in Finland, before the band supported Kiss on their Unmasked Tour from 24 August to 16 October, immediately following which guitarist Dennis Stratton was sacked and replaced with Adrian Smith. After Smith was hired, the band decided to undertake another British tour, taking place from 21 November to 21 December. The Killer World Tour was a concert tour by the heavy metal band Iron Maiden from 17 February 1981 to 15 November 1981. This would be the band's first world tour, including their debut shows in North America (where they supported Judas Priest on their World Wide Blitz Tour and UFO on select dates) and Japan where they recorded the live release, "Maiden Japan". On top of this, the band moved into larger venues in the United Kingdom, including the Hammersmith Odeon, London. The Ballroom Blitz Tour is a concert tour by Nu metal band Korn in support of their ninth studio album "". The album marks the return of producer Ross Robinson, who produced the band's self-titled album in 1994 and its follow-up "Life Is Peachy" in 1996. Much like the new album, the Ballroom Blitz Tour is said to recreate the band's early sound. The tour is also set in smaller venues similar to the band's early tours. Frontman Jonathan Davis explained that "early tours were some of the best times of our lives. Now we are looking to bring that vibe back in a big way". Opening acts for the tour included 2 Cents, Big Jay Oakerson, Dimmu Borgir, Rise to Remain and Shihad. Bruce Dickinson, a British heavy metal singer, has released six studio albums, two live albums, one compilations, ten singles, three video albums, fourteen music videos, and one box set. In 1979, after playing in local groups, Dickinson joined hard rock band Samson. He departed after two years to become Iron Maiden's lead vocalist. His debut with this band is considered a "masterpiece", which was followed with a series of top-ten releases. In 1989, while Iron Maiden were taking a year off, Dickinson and former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, composed a song for . His solo debut, "Tattooed Millionaire" (1990), was an effort that favoured a hard rock/pop metal approach, different from what fans assumed would be an aggressive, Iron Maiden-like album. Four songs—the title track, "Dive! Dive! Dive! ", "Born in '58", and a cover version of David Bowie's "All the Young Dudes"—were released as singles. Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden, accompanied by Gers as the new guitarist, and the project went on hiatus. " Dive! Dive! Live! " was a live video recorded from a concert in Los Angeles, California, in August 1990, and released in July 1991. "Virus" is a single from Iron Maiden, released in 1996. It is the first single since 1980's "Women in Uniform" that does not appear on any official Iron Maiden studio album. It was, however, featured as a brand new track on the band's first ever career retrospective — 1996's double-disc "Best of the Beast". It is the only Iron Maiden song to be credited to both of the band's guitarists. It has never been performed live by Iron Maiden, but Blaze Bayley performed it several times in his solo career. Lyrically, the song warns of rising business corruption in an increasingly Internet-dependent world. The Raven Age is an English heavy metal band formed in London in 2009 by guitarists Dan Wright and George Harris (son of Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris). In 2014 the band recorded and released their self-titled EP before supporting Steve Harris British Lion and Tremonti on separate tours. The band then supported Iron Maiden on The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016. On 2 August 2016 the band announced their debut album "Darkness Will Rise" would be released in December 2016, but it ended up being released in March 2017. The band supported Anthrax on the Among The Kings European Tour in 2017. The World Wide Blitz Tour was a 1981 concert tour by British heavy metal band Judas Priest where the band toured in Europe as well as the U.S. from February 13 to Deceber 14, 1981 in support of the 1981 album "Point of Entry".

**Question:** Which component of shellite has the formula (ON)CHOH?
**Answer:** picric acid

**Context:**
Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol), also called dimethyl carbinol or, incorrectly, isopropanol, is a compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH (sometimes represented as "i"-PrOH). It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor. As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH)CHOH. It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol. It has a wide variety of industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents. Alcohol is any organic compound in which a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms. An important class are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general formula for which is CHOH. Of those, ethanol (CHOH) is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, and in common speech the word alcohol refers specifically to ethanol. Articles related to alcohol include: Shellite (known as Tridite in US service) is an explosive mixture of Picric acid and Dinitrophenol or Picric acid and Hexanitrodiphenylamine in a ratio of 70/30. It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century. Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) is an organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula [P(CHOH)]Cl. The cation P(CHOH) is four-coordinate, as is typical for phosphonium salts. THPC has applications as a precursor to fire-retardant materials. 1-Hexanol is an organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH(CH)OH. This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol. Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, exist, both of which differing by the location of the hydroxyl group. Many isomeric alcohols have the formula CHOH. It is used in the perfume industry. 1-Pentanol, (or n-pentanol, pentan-1-ol), is an alcohol with five carbon atoms and the molecular formula CHOH. 1-Pentanol is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant aroma. It is the straight-chain form of amyl alcohol, one of 8 isomers with that formula. An aldonic acid is any of a family of sugar acids obtained by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose to form a carboxylic acid functional group. Thus, their general chemical formula is HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH. Oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde yields a uronic acid, while oxidation of both terminal ends yields an aldaric acid. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener. The name derives from Greek: ξύλον , "xyl[on]", "wood" + suffix -"itol", used to denote sugar alcohols. Xylitol is categorized as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol). It has the formula CHOH(CHOH)CHOH and is an achiral isomer of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol. Multiple studies using electron microscopy have indicated that xylitol is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel. Fair evidence was found that xylitol (as chewing gum, lozenges, nasal spray, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children. In a mixture between a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity formula_1 and the dielectric constant formula_2 of this mixture show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold. The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side. To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor-capacitor model (R-C model) is used. Picric acid is an organic compound with the formula (ON)CHOH. Its IUPAC name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP). The name "picric" comes from the Greek πικρός ("pikros"), meaning "bitter", reflecting its bitter taste. It is one of the most acidic phenols. Like other highly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which was once its primary use. It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes.

**Question:** Both Phaedranassa and Mitella are considered the classification of what level of species?
**Answer:** genus

**Context:**
Asiatosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodyloid crocodilians that lived in Eurasia during the Paleogene. Many Paleogene crocodilians from Europe and Asia have been attributed to "Asiatosuchus" since the genus was named in 1940. These species have a generalized crocodilian morphology typified by flat, triangular skulls. The feature that traditionally united these species under the genus "Asiatosuchus" is a broad connection or symphysis between the two halves of the lower jaw. Recent studies of the evolutionary relationships of early crocodilians along with closer examinations of the morphology of fossil specimens suggest that only the first named species of "Asiatosuchus", "A. grangeri" from the Eocene of Mongolia, belongs in the genus. Most species are now regarded as "nomina dubia" or "dubious names", meaning that their type specimens lack the unique anatomical features necessary to justify their classification as distinct species. Other species such as ""A." germanicus" and ""A." depressifrons" are still considered valid species, but they do not form an evolutionary grouping with "A. grangeri" that would warrant them being placed together in the genus "Asiatosuchus". Ardipithecus kadabba is the scientific classification given to fossil remains "known only from teeth and bits and pieces of skeletal bones," originally estimated to be 5.8 to 5.2 million years old, and later revised to 5.77 to 5.54 million years. According to the first description, these fossils are close to the common ancestor of chimps and humans. Their development lines are estimated to have parted 6.5–5.5 million years ago. It has been described as a "probable chronospecies" (i.e. ancestor) of "A. ramidus". Although originally considered a subspecies of "A. ramidus", in 2004 anthropologists Yohannes Haile-Selassie, Gen Suwa, and Tim D. White published an article elevating "A. kadabba" to species level on the basis of newly discovered teeth from Ethiopia. These teeth show "primitive morphology and wear pattern" which demonstrate that "A. kadabba" is a distinct species from "A. ramidus". Mitella is a genus of flowering plants known as miterworts or bishop's caps. "Mitella" species are native to temperate and arctic North America and Asia. Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface. Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management. Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used. In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management. Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations. Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. Prehypertension, also known as high normal blood pressure, is an American medical classification for cases where a person's blood pressure is elevated above normal, but not to the level considered hypertension (high blood pressure). Prehypertension is blood pressure readings with a systolic pressure from 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure from 80 to 89 mm Hg. Readings greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg are considered hypertension. Classification of blood pressure is based upon two or more readings at two or more separate occasions separated by at least one week. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) proposed the new labeling for elevated blood pressure values below 140/90 to more accurately communicate the tendency of blood pressure to rise with age. In 1984, the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study set up a working party, now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group, to produce a consensus classification of the cactus family, down to the level of genus. Their classification has been used as the basis for systems published since the mid-1990s. Treatments in the 21st century have generally divided the family into around 125–130 genera and 1,400–1,500 species, which are then arranged in a number of tribes and subfamilies. However, subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that a very high proportion of the higher taxa (genera, tribes and subfamilies) are not monophyletic, i.e. they do not contain all of the descendants of a common ancestor. , the internal classification of the family Cactaceae remained uncertain and subject to change. A classification incorporating many of the insights from the molecular studies was produced by Nyffeler and Eggli in 2010. Aceria clianthi is a species of mite belonging to the family Eriophyidae. It is found only in New Zealand. It is notable for being host specific to threatened plants of the genus "Clianthus". It is classified by Buckley "et al." as "nationally critical" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. They stated ""Aceria clianthi" (Eriophyidae), has been recorded only from kakabeak ("Clianthus" spp.) in cultivation and once on "Lotus cornalatus" ["Lotus corniculatus"] (Fabaceae), an introduced plant growing near kakabeak (Martin 2009). It is given the same threat classification as kakabeak (de Lange et al. 2009)." Heenan had earlier stated that "the two species [of "Clianthus"] are considered to be threatened, with "C. maximus" having a rank of vulnerable, whereas "C. puniceus" is critically endangered", but the conservation status of "C. maximus" was subsequently found to be more serious. These threat classifications for "Clianthus" apply to plants in the wild, but the species are widely cultivated. "Aceria clianthi" occurs on both plants in the wild and in cultivation. Phaedranassa is a genus of South American and Central American plants in Amaryllis family, subfamily Amaryllidoideae. There are around 233 species in the genus "Utricularia", belonging to the Bladderwort family (Lentibulariaceae). It is the largest genus of carnivorous plants and has a worldwide distribution, being absent only from Antarctica and the oceanic islands. This genus was considered to have 250 species until Peter Taylor reduced the number to 214 in his exhaustive study, "The genus Utricularia - a taxonomic monograph", published by HMSO (1989). Taylor's classification is generally accepted, though his division of the genus in two subgenera was soon seen as obsolete. Molecular genetic studies have mostly confirmed Taylor's sections with some modifications (Jobson et al., 2003), but reinstalled the division of the genus in three subgenera. This list follows the subgeneric classification "sensu" Müller & Borsch (2005), updated with new information in Müller et al. (2006). The coast horned lizard ("Phrynosoma coronatum") is a species of phrynosomatid lizard which can be found in Baja California Sur. The old classification included all three current species "P. blainvillii", "P. cerroense", and "P. coronatum" as a single species ("P. coronatum") ranging from Baja California north to California's Sacramento Valley. It was previously considered to be a widely divergent species with over 6 subspecies in their relatively small range but is now classified as three distinct species. As a defense the lizard can shoot high pressure streams of blood out of its eyes if threatened.

**Question:** What British company was involved in recording the audiobook for the book known as The Golden Compass in North America?
**Answer:** BBC

**Context:**
English America (later British America) refers to the English territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as "British America and the British West Indies" until 1776, when the Thirteen Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, the term British North America was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. That term was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report. Northern Lights is a book by Philip Pullman, written in 1995. The BBC and Cavalcade audiobook was first recorded in 2002 The N. Murray Edwards School of Business, also known as the Edwards School of Business, or simply Edwards, is located on the University of Saskatchewan campus in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Formerly the College of Commerce, the school was renamed in 2007 to honor N. Murray Edwards, an alumnus and entrepreneur.

**Question:** The movie "100 Million BC" continues the urban myth of an experiment allegedly carried out at waht shipyard?
**Answer:** Philadelphia Naval Shipyard

**Context:**
The 999 phone charging myth is an urban myth that claims that if a mobile phone has low battery then dialing 999 (or any regional emergency number) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls. 100 Million BC is a 2008 direct-to-DVD action film by film studio The Asylum, continuing the urban myth of the Philadelphia Experiment. Robert William McConnell (c. 1944 – 5 April 1976), was a Northern Irish loyalist who allegedly carried out or was an accomplice to a number of sectarian attacks and killings, although he never faced any charges or convictions. McConnell served part-time as a corporal in the 2nd Battalion Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), and was a suspected member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) The Kalmunai massacre refers to a series of mass killings that occurred in June 1990 in Kalmunai, a municipality within the Ampara District of Sri Lanka's Eastern Province. The massacre of civilians was allegedly carried out by the Sri Lankan Army in retaliation for an earlier massacre of Sri Lankan police officers. The University Teachers for Human Rights, a human rights organization, put the number of dead in the second massacre at 250, while a local Member of Parliament claimed that at least 160 people were killed. The Sinchon Museum of American War Atrocities (Korean: 신천박물관) is a museum dedicated to the Sinchon Massacre, a mass-murder of North Korean civilians allegedly carried out by US troops during the Korean War. The museum is located in Sinchon County of North Korea. In July 2015, the museum was rebuilt and moved to a new location in the country. The Gelaohui (; Pinyin: Gēlǎohuì; lit.

Further 28 civilians were severely injured as well. It was a notable mass murder of civilians since the resumption of armed conflict between rebel forces and Sri Lankan armed forces since April 1995 as part of the Sri Lankan civil war. The then government arrested number of soldiers and home guards who allegedly carried out the massacre and a court case was started on 2004. On 27 July 2016 the court acquitted six former army Corporals who were accused over the massacre, after they were found not guilty. "White Tights" (also "White Pantyhose" or White Stockings; the "beliye kolgotki", Russian: белые колготки ; Latvian: "baltās zeķbikses" ; Estonian: "valged sukkpüksid" ) is a Russian urban myth surrounding the alleged participation of female sniper mercenaries in combat against Russian forces in various armed conflicts from late 1980s. The myth describes these women as blond Amazon-like nationalistic biathletes turned anti-Russian mercenaries. They come predominantly from the Baltic states, but subsequent variations of the myth have diversified the ethnic composition of the snipers, including Ukrainian, Russian women in their midst. The name "White Tights" originates from the white-coloured winter sports attire these snipers were wearing and was first coined during the Nagorno-Karabakh War.

**Question:** Are Colocasia and Coronilla both flowering plants?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
Caladium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. They are often known by the common name elephant ear (which they share with the closely related genera "Alocasia", "Colocasia", and "Xanthosoma"), Heart of Jesus, and Angel Wings. There are over 1000 named cultivars of "Caladium bicolor" from the original South American plant. Xanthosoma is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as "malanga", "otoy", "otoe", cocoyam (or new cocoyam), "tannia", "tannier", "yautía", "macabo", "ocumo", "macal", "taioba", "dasheen", "quequisque", "ʻ ape" and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro ("taro kongkong"). Many other species (including especially "X. roseum") are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera "Caladium", "Colocasia" (i.e., taro), and "Alocasia". The genus Coronilla contains about 20 species of flowering plants native to Europe and North Africa. Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions. Common names include tarul, karkala ko ganu, elephant-ear, taro, cocoyam, dasheen, chembu, champadhumpa, shavige gadde, and eddoe. Elephant-ear and cocoyam are also used for some other large-leaved genera in the Araceae, notably "Xanthosoma" and "Caladium". The generic name is derived from the ancient Greek word "kolokasion", which in the Greek botanist Dioscorides (1st century AD) meant the edible roots of both "Colocasia esculenta" and "Nelumbo nucifera". It is thought that the edible roots of "Colocasia esculenta" have been cultivated in Asia for more than ten thousand years. The species "Colocasia esculenta" is an invasive species in wetlands along the American Gulf coast, where it threatens to displace native wetland plants.

**Question:** The eldest daughter of Princess Louise of Denmark and Norway was the wife of a king whose motto was what?
**Answer:** God and the just cause

**Context:**
Princess Margherita of Bourbon-Parma (Italian: "Margherita Maria Teresa Enrichetta, Principessa di Parma" ) (1 January 1847 – 29 January 1893) was the eldest child and daughter of Charles III, Duke of Parma and Princess Louise Marie Thérèse of France, the eldest daughter of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry and Princess Caroline Ferdinande Louise of the Two Sicilies. Margherita was thus a great-granddaughter of Charles X of France. She was born in Lucca, Duchy of Parma. She was a niece of Henri, comte de Chambord, disputedly King of France and Navarre from 2 to 9 August 1830 and afterwards the Legitimist Pretender to the throne of France from 1844 to 1883. Through her marriage to Carlos, Duke of Madrid, Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne, Margherita was titular Queen consort of Spain, France, and Navarre. Princess Louise of Denmark ("Louise Caroline Josephine Sophie Thyra Olga") (17 February 1875 – 4 April 1906) was a Danish princess, the third child and oldest daughter of Frederick VIII of Denmark and his wife, Princess Louise of Sweden and Norway. Arthur Collins CB, MVO, Commander, Hohenzollern Order (26 June 1845 – 21 November 1911), was Equerry and Comptroller for Princess Louise, Queen Victoria's 4th daughter and Gentleman Usher in the households of Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. He attended Princess Louise in her role as the wife of John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll (at that time Marquis of Lorne), who was Governor General and Vice Regent of Canada between 1878 and 1883. Collins represented Princess Louise at the funerals of Lord Beaconsfield, Benjamin Disraeli, and William Ewart Gladstone, the two competing Prime Ministers during Queen Victoria's reign. Collins attended as a Gentleman Usher the coronation of King Edward VII and probably Victoria's funeral. Princess Louise was a sidewheel steamboat built in 1869. From 1869 to 1879 this ship was named "Olympia". In 1879 the name was changed to "Princess Louise", after Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, a daughter of Queen Victoria who was married to Marquess of Lorne (1845-1914), Governor General of Canada from 1878 to 1883. "Princess Louise" was the last sidewheeler to be operated commercially on the coast of British Columbia. Princess Marie of Windisch-Graetz (11 December 1856 – 9 August 1929) was an Austrian noble. She was the daughter of Hugo, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, and Princess Louise of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (herself the eldest daughter of Grand Duke Paul Frederick and Princess Alexandrine of Prussia). Princess Louise of Denmark and Norway (Danish: "Louise af Danmark" ; Norwegian: "Louise av Danmark" ) (20 January 1750 – 12 January 1831) was born to Frederick V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain. Her eldest daughter, Marie of Hesse-Kassel, was the wife of Frederick VI of Denmark. Frederick VI (Danish and Norwegian: "Frederik"; 28 January 17683 December 1839) was King of Denmark from 13 March 1808 to 3 December 1839 and King of Norway from 13 March 1808 to 7 February 1814. From 1784 until his accession, he served as regent during his father's mental illness and was referred to as the "Crown Prince Regent" ("kronprinsregent"). For his motto he chose "God and the just cause" (Danish: "Gud og den retfærdige sag" ) and since the time of his reign, succeeding Danish monarchs have also chosen mottos in the Danish language rather than the formerly customary Latin. Princess Alice of Bourbon-Parma (Italian: "Alicia Maria Carolina Ferdinanda Rachael Giovanna Filomena" ; 27 December 1849, Parma, Duchy of Parma – 16 November 1935, Schwertberg, Austria) was the youngest daughter of Charles III, Duke of Parma and Princess Louise Marie Thérèse of France, the eldest daughter of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry and Princess Caroline Ferdinande Louise of the Two Sicilies. Princess Louise of Belgium (18 February 1858 in Brussels – 1 March 1924 in Wiesbaden) was the eldest daughter of Leopold II and his wife, Marie Henriette of Austria. Louise was named after her paternal grandmother, the Belgian queen Louise of Orleans, and her mother. Prince Henry of Bourbon-Parma, Count of Bardi (Italian: "Enrico Carlo Luigi Giorgio, Principe di Parma, Conte di Bardi" ) (12 February 1851 in Parma, Duchy of Parma – 14 April 1905 in Menton, France) was the youngest son and child of Charles III, Duke of Parma and his wife Princess Louise Marie Thérèse of France, the eldest daughter of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry and Princess Caroline Ferdinande Louise of the Two Sicilies.

**Question:** Nikolay Mitrofanovich Krylov and Anatoly Fomenko both held what academic title?
**Answer:** mathematician

**Context:**
Nicolai Vladimirovich Krylov (Russian: Никола́й Влади́мирович Крыло́в ; born 5 June 1941) is a Russian mathematician specializing in partial differential equations, particularly stochastic partial differential equations and diffusion processes. Krylov studied at Lomonosov University, where he in 1966 under E. B. Dynkin attained a doctoral candidate title (similar to a PhD) and in 1973 a Russian doctoral degree (somewhat more prestigious than a PhD). He taught from 1966 to 1990 at the Lomonosov University and is since 1990 a professor at the University of Minnesota. At the beginning of his career (starting from 1963) he, in collaboration with Dynkin, worked on nonlinear stochastic control theory, making advances in the study of convex, nonlinear partial equations of 2nd order ("i.e." Bellman equations), which were examined with stochastic methods. This led to the Evans-Krylov theory, for which he received with Lawrence C. Evans in 2004 the Leroy P. Steele Prize of the American Mathematical Society (for work done simultaneously and independently by both Krylov and Evans). They proved the second order differentiability (Hölder continuity of the second derivative) of the solutions of convex, completely nonlinear, second order elliptical partial differential equations and thus the existence of "classical solutions" (Theorem of Evans-Krylov). He was in 1978 at Helsinki and in 1986 at Berkeley an Invited Speaker for the ICM. He received the Humboldt Research Award in 2001. In 1993 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993). He should not be confused with the mathematician Nikolay M. Krylov. Anatoly Timofeevich Fomenko (Russian: Анато́лий Тимофе́евич Фоме́нко ) (born 13 March 1945 in Stalino, USSR) is a Soviet and Russian mathematician, professor at Moscow State University, well known as a topologist, and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is author of a pseudoscientific theory known as New Chronology. He is also a member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (1991). The Doctor of Business Administration (abbreviated DBA, D.B.A., DrBA, or Dr.B.A.) is a research doctorate awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of business administration. Along with research skills the doctorate focuses on business intelligence and original theoretical study. The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration, and is equivalent to the Ph.D in Business Administration. Along with the Ph.D, it represents the highest academic qualification in business administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. or Ph.D in Business Administration is required to gain employment as a full-time, tenure-track university professor or postdoctoral researcher in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree are awarded the academic title doctor, which is often represented via the English honorific "Dr." or the post-nominal letters "D.B.A.", "DBA", "Dr.B.A." , or "DrBA". Associate professor (frequently capitalized as Associate Professor) is an academic title that can have different meanings. In North America and universities elsewhere using the North American system, it is a position between assistant professor and a full professorship. In some Commonwealth countries, the title associate professor is often used in place of reader, which is used in the United Kingdom and a number of other Commonwealth universities; this usage is typical of universities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in South Africa, India, parts of Southeast Asia, Ireland and other countries. The title associate professor in those countries, like the title reader, corresponds to a full professorship in North America. In control systems theory, the describing function (DF) method, developed by Nikolay Mitrofanovich Krylov and Nikolay Bogoliubov in the 1930s, and extended by Ralph Kochenburger is an approximate procedure for analyzing certain nonlinear control problems. It is based on quasi-linearization, which is the approximation of the non-linear system under investigation by a linear time-invariant (LTI) transfer function that depends on the amplitude of the input waveform. By definition, a transfer function of a true LTI system cannot depend on the amplitude of the input function because an LTI system is linear. Thus, this dependence on amplitude generates a family of linear systems that are combined in an attempt to capture salient features of the non-linear system behavior. The describing function is one of the few widely applicable methods for designing nonlinear systems, and is very widely used as a standard mathematical tool for analyzing limit cycles in closed-loop controllers, such as industrial process controls, servomechanisms, and electronic oscillators. Nikolay Mitrofanovich Krylov (Russian: Никола́й Митрофа́нович Крыло́в , Ukrainian: Микола Митрофанович Крилов ) (29 November [O.S. 17 November] 1879 – May 11, 1955) was a Russian and Soviet mathematician known for works on interpolation, non-linear mechanics, and numerical methods for solving equations of mathematical physics. The Master of Music (M.M. or M.Mus.) is, as an academic title, the first graduate degree in Music awarded by universities and conservatories. The M.M. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization. The M.M. is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions. The New Chronology is a pseudohistorical theory which argues that the conventional chronology of Middle Eastern and European history is fundamentally flawed, and that events attributed to the civilizations of the Roman Empire, Ancient Greece and Ancient Egypt actually occurred during the Middle Ages, more than a thousand years later. The central concepts of the New Chronology are derived from the ideas of Russian scholar Nikolai Morozov (1854–1946), although work by French scholar Jean Hardouin (1646–1729) can be viewed as an earlier predecessor. However, the New Chronology is most commonly associated with Russian mathematician Anatoly Fomenko (born 1945), although published works on the subject are actually a collaboration between Fomenko and several other mathematicians. The concept is most fully explained in "History: Fiction or Science?" , originally published in Russian. Doctor is an academic title that originates from the Latin word of the same spelling and meaning. The word is originally an agentive noun of the Latin verb "docēre " ] 'to teach'. It has been used as an academic title in Europe since the 13th century, when the first doctorates were awarded at the University of Bologna and the University of Paris. Having become established in European universities, this usage spread around the world. Contracted "Dr" or "Dr.", it is used as a designation for a person who has obtained a Doctorate (e.g. PhD). In many parts of the world it is also used by medical practitioners, regardless of whether or not they hold a doctoral-level degree. Georgian International Academy (Georgian: საქართველოს საერთაშორისო აკადემია ) is a research and academic institution located in Tbilisi, Georgia. The academy is one of the few Georgian institutions which awards the degree “Doctor Academician” – the highest academic title in Europe.

Maarten van der Vleuten (] ) is a Dutch producer, composer and recording artist born in Vught, The Netherlands in 1967. Between 1987 and 2007 he used over two dozens of aliases, producing Detroit techno, electro, house, experimental and ambient music. In early 2008 he announced that he would only use his real name for future releases. He recorded for R&S Records, Outrage Recordings, Apollo Records (Belgium), Djax-Up-Beats, See Saw, ESP and Klang Elektronik to name just a few. Since 1996 he is also releasing music on his own label Signum Recordings (and its two sublabels Passiflora and Glam). Maarten's musical vision knows no limits: working in his own studio, he's constantly experimenting and exploring all aspects of (danceable) music, looking for innovation and bringing new angles to it. Due to his experimental vision towards his music, Van Der Vleuten's productions are not mainstream material. As a result of that he has gained more credits from within the "underground" scene. Or as the database of the Dutch Rock & Pop Institute writes; "one of the pioneers of the dutch dance scene". Der ferne Klang ("The Distant Sound") is an opera by Franz Schreker, libretto by the composer. Putra Komuter station is a Malaysian commuter train halt in Kuala Lumpur named in part after the Putra World Trade Centre located nearby.

The opera was also largely inspired by Janáček's love for Kamila Stösslová. This is often considered his first "mature" opera, despite the fact that he was 67 when it was premiered. "Káťa Kabanová" is a clear response to Janáček's feelings for Kamila, and the work is dedicated to her. The first performance was at the National Theatre (Národní divadlo v Brně ) in Brno on 23 November 1921. Eilene Hannan AM (24 July 194611 July 2014) was an Australian operatic soprano with an international reputation.

**Question:** Are Alice Munro and Lillian Hellman both writers?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
Alice Ann Munro ( , "née" Laidlaw ; born 10 July 1931) is a Canadian short story writer and Nobel Prize winner. Munro's work has been described as having revolutionized the architecture of short stories, especially in its tendency to move forward and backward in time. Her stories have been said to "embed more than announce, reveal more than parade." Lillian Hellman: An Imperious Life is a 2014 book by Dorothy Gallagher. It is a critical biography of the American playwright and writer Lillian Hellman. Lillian Florence Hellman (June 20, 1905 – June 30, 1984) was an American dramatist and screenwriter known for her success as a playwright on Broadway, as well as her left-wing sympathies and political activism. She was blacklisted after her appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) at the height of the anti-communist campaigns of 1947–52. Although she continued to work on Broadway in the 1950s, her blacklisting by the American film industry caused a drop in her income. Many praised Hellman for refusing to answer questions by HUAC, but others believed, despite her denial, that she had belonged to the Communist Party. The Autumn Garden is a 1951 play by Lillian Hellman. The play is set in September, 1949 in a summer home in a resort on the Gulf of Mexico, about 100 miles from New Orleans. The play is a study of the defeats, disappointments and diminished expectations of people reaching middle age. For inspiration, Hellman drew on her memories of her time in her aunts' boardinghouse. Dashiell Hammett, who had been Hellman's lover for 20 years, helped her write the play and received 15 percent of the royalties. Of all Hellman's plays it was her favorite. Vann Nath (Khmer: វ៉ាន់ណាត ; 1946 – September 5, 2011) was a Cambodian painter, artist, writer, and human rights activist who was one of a diverse group of writers from 22 countries to receive the prestigious Lillian Hellman/Hammett Award, which recognizes courage in the face of political persecution—which he faced during the Khmer Rouge. He was the eighth Cambodian to win the award since 1995. Dash and Lilly is a 1999 Emmy and Golden Globe Award-nominated biographical television film about writers Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman. The film was directed by actress Kathy Bates and written by Jerrold L. Ludwig. It stars Sam Shepard and Judy Davis. Marcus Samuel Blitzstein (March 2, 1905January 22, 1964), was an American composer, lyricist, and librettist. He won national attention in 1937 when his pro-union musical "The Cradle Will Rock", directed by Orson Welles, was shut down by the Works Progress Administration. He is known for "The Cradle Will Rock" and for his Off-Broadway translation/adaptation of "The Threepenny Opera" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. His works also include the opera "Regina", an adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play "The Little Foxes"; the Broadway musical "Juno", based on Seán O'Casey's play "Juno and the Paycock"; and "No for an Answer". He completed translation/adaptations of Brecht's and Weill's musical play "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny" and of Brecht's play "Mother Courage and Her Children" with music by Paul Dessau. Blitzstein also composed music for films, such as "Surf and Seaweed" (1931) and "The Spanish Earth" (1937), and he contributed two songs to the original 1960 production of Hellman's play "Toys in the Attic". The Little Foxes (1941) is an American drama film directed by William Wyler. The screenplay by Lillian Hellman is based on her 1939 play of the same name. Hellman's ex-husband Arthur Kober, Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell contributed additional scenes and dialogue. Candide is an operetta with music composed by Leonard Bernstein, based on the 1759 novella of the same name by Voltaire. The operetta was first performed in 1956 with a libretto by Lillian Hellman; but since 1974 it has been generally performed with a book by Hugh Wheeler which is more faithful to Voltaire's novel. The primary lyricist was the poet Richard Wilbur. Other contributors to the text were John Latouche, Dorothy Parker, Lillian Hellman, Stephen Sondheim, John Mauceri, John Wells, and Bernstein himself. Maurice Peress and Hershy Kay contributed orchestrations. Although unsuccessful at its premiere, "Candide" has now overcome the unenthusiastic reaction of early audiences and critics and achieved enormous popularity. It is very popular among major music schools as a student show because of the quality of its music and the opportunities it offers to student singers. Julia is a 1977 American drama film directed by Fred Zinnemann, from a screenplay by Alvin Sargent. It is based on a chapter from Lillian Hellman's book "Pentimento" about the author's relationship with a lifelong friend, "Julia," who fought against the Nazis in the years prior to World War II. Hellman said the story was true, but critics have challenged its accuracy. The film in DeLuxe Color was produced by Richard Roth, with Julien Derode as executive producer and Tom Pevsner as associate producer.

**Answer:** I Saw Her Standing There

**Context:**
Tonight's the Night is the debut album by American girl group quartet The Shirelles, released in 1961. It contains the hit song "Will You Love Me Tomorrow". Although Shirley Owens was the group's main lead singer, "Tonight's the Night" also features lead vocals by Doris Coley and Beverly Lee; all four members share lead for "Doin' the Ronde". Later on in 1963, "Unlucky" was covered by Dionne Warwick for her debut album. " Boys", which had been the B-side of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and a regional hit on its original release, became better known after it was covered by The Beatles on their debut album "Please Please Me" in 1963. "The Beatles" and "The Rolling Stones" were arguably the biggest bands of the 1960s. Both bands started their careers in the early 1960s in the United Kingdom and rose to fame as part of the British invasion. The Beatles rose to fame in the UK in 1963 with their singles "Please Please Me" and 'Love Me Do". After a successful album contract the band decided to leave Liverpool and move to London. The Rolling Stones were a struggling band at the time and the Beatles had become famous as a self contained Rock Band. Original song content was getting tougher to acquire in the United Kingdom so the Rolling Stones were a Rock and Roll Blues cover group. On meeting the Beatles at a London Pub; John Lennon and Paul McCartney agreed to write an original single for the Rolling Stones called "I Wanna Be Your Man". The song gave the Stones their first commercial success and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards began writing as well. "Twist and Shout" is a 1961 song written by Phil Medley and Bert Berns (later credited as "Bert Russell"). The song was originally recorded by the Top Notes. It first became a chart hit as a cover single by the Isley Brothers in 1962. The song has since been covered by several artists, including the Beatles on their first album "Please Please Me" (1963), as well as the Tremeloes in 1962 and the Who in 1970 and 1984. "I Saw Her Standing There" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon. It is the opening track on the band's 1963 debut album "Please Please Me". Renditions is the first studio album by Amelia Warner under the name Slow Moving Millie. The album features the songs 'Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want' which was the song for the John Lewis 2011 Christmas advert, and 'Beasts' which was used in a Virgin Media TV advert. The first eight tracks on the album are covers but 'Beasts' and 'Hart With A Crown & Chain' were written by Amelia Warner and are original tracks for the album. After the first week of release, the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number 89. "Ask Me Why" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles originally released in the United Kingdom as the B-side of their hit single "Please Please Me".

I Love You" is a song composed principally by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney) and recorded by the English rock band the Beatles, with McCartney on lead vocal. It was released on 5 October 1962 as the B-side of their debut single "Love Me Do" and is also included on their 1963 album "Please Please Me". It was later included on the 1964 American release "Introducing The Beatles", its 1965 reissue "The Early Beatles" and the 1977 Beatles compilation "Love Songs". Tiffany Renee Darwish (born October 2, 1971), also known as Tiffany, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and former teen icon. She is most notable for her 1987 cover of "I Think We're Alone Now", a 1967 original recording by Tommy James and the Shondells. Released as the second single from her eponymous album, "Tiffany", the song quickly became a teen anthem. Thanks to an original mall tour, "The Beautiful You: Celebrating The Good Life Shopping Mall Tour '87", Tiffany found commercial success; both the single and the album peaked at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and "Billboard" 200 charts, respectively. The singles "Could've Been" and "I Saw Him Standing There", a cover version of The Beatles' "I Saw Her Standing There", followed soon after, with the former also claiming the number one position on the "Billboard" Hot 100. "Please Please Me" is a song and the second single released by English rock group the Beatles in the United Kingdom, and the first to be issued in the United States. It was also the title track of their first LP, which was recorded to capitalise on the success of the single. It was originally a John Lennon composition (credited to Lennon–McCartney), although its ultimate form was significantly influenced by George Martin. John Lennon: "Please Please Me is my song completely. It was my attempt at writing a Roy Orbison song, would you believe it? I wrote it in the bedroom in my house at Menlove Avenue, which was my auntie's place". Please Please Me is the debut studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Parlophone rush-released the album on 22 March 1963 in the United Kingdom to capitalise on the success of their singles "Please Please Me" (No. 1 on most lists though only No. 2 on "Record Retailer") and "Love Me Do" (No. 17).

**Question:** Which writer of the song "Money, Money, Money" by pop group ABBA was born on 16 December 1946 ?
**Answer:** Benny Andersson

**Context:**
Arrival is the fourth studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA. It was originally released in Sweden on 11 October 1976 by Polar Records. Recording sessions began in August 1975 and continued until September 1976 at Metronome and Glen studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It became one of ABBA's most successful albums to date, producing three of their biggest hits: "Dancing Queen", "Money, Money, Money" and "Knowing Me, Knowing You". Upon its original 1976 release, "Fernando", released as a single earlier the same year, did not appear on "Arrival", but it was included on the Australian and New Zealand versions. "Arrival" was the best-selling album of 1977 in the United Kingdom and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. "Money, Money, Money" is a song recorded by Swedish pop group ABBA, written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus. It was released as a single on 1 November 1976, as the follow-up to "Dancing Queen" (both from the album "Arrival"). The B-side, "Crazy World", was recorded in 1974 during the sessions for the album "ABBA". ABBA: The Movie is a 1977 documentary film about the pop group ABBA's Australian tour. It was directed by Lasse Hallström, who directed most of the group's videos. The film has become a cult film among ABBA fans. Its release coincided with the release of "", the group's fifth studio album, and features many songs from that album as well as many of their earlier hits, and one, "Get on the Carousel", unavailable anywhere else. "I'm a Marionette" is a song recorded by the Swedish pop group ABBA from their fifth album, "". Written by Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, this song was part of a mini-musical called "The Girl with the Golden Hair" that ABBA performed at several of their live concerts. The other songs in the "mini-musical" were "Thank You for the Music", "I Wonder (Departure)" and "Get on the Carousel". With the exception of the last track, studio versions of these appeared on the 1977 ABBA album. "I'm a Marionette" was the B-side of "Take a Chance on Me", when it was released as a single. "The Piper" is a 1980 track off the "Super Trouper" album by Swedish pop group ABBA. The song is loosely based on the famous story of The Pied Piper of Hamelin. It is regarded by some ABBA fans as being very different from the more mainstream songs they had recorded until this time. In particular, the dark lyrics dealing with the seduction by fascistic leaders and a somewhat medieval sound (drums, flute, choral) are not seen in their earlier songs. It is also the only ABBA song where a part of the refrain is in Latin. The song has gained a small cult following among ABBA fans. "Disillusion" is a ballad by the pop group ABBA, on their first album "Ring Ring" (1973). It is notable as the only song ABBA recorded to have a song-writing credit from Agnetha Faltskog. She, unlike Anni-Frid Lyngstad, was a songwriter as well as a singer, and had dabbled in that in her pre-ABBA career. She wrote the music, with lyrics added by fellow ABBA member Björn Ulvaeus. "I Have a Dream" is a song by Swedish pop group ABBA. It was featured on the group's sixth studio album "Voulez-Vous" and released as a single in December 1979. The single became a big hit, topping the charts in many countries and peaking at No. 2 in the UK over the Christmas week of 1979. Twenty years later, Irish pop group Westlife released a version of the song which reached No. 1 in the UK over the Christmas week of 1999. "That's Me", originally "Coachman's Farm", is a song recorded by the Swedish pop group ABBA in 1976. It was released as a single in Japan the following year (with "Money, Money, Money" as the B-side) to promote the band's "Arrival" album, and reached number 75 on the official Japanese charts. Elsewhere, "That's Me" was used as the B-side to ABBA's hit single, "Dancing Queen". My Love, My Life is a compilation album released by Agnetha Fältskog, a former member of Swedish pop group ABBA, in 1996. The album is named after the ABBA song "My Love, My Life". The two-disc set primarily features Swedish-language songs recorded by Fältskog, but it also contains a few songs recorded in English, including some of her favourite ABBA songs, such as "My Love, My Life" and "The Winner Takes It All". Göran Bror Benny Andersson (] ; born 16 December 1946) is a Swedish musician, composer, member of the Swedish music group ABBA (1972–1982), and co-composer of the musicals "Chess", "Kristina från Duvemåla", and "Mamma Mia!

Pakistan recorded one of the highest temperatures in the world – 53.5 °C – on 26 May 2010, the hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan, but also the hottest reliably measured temperature ever recorded on the continent of Asia. As Pakistan is located on a great landmass north of the Tropic of Cancer (between latitudes 25° and 36° N), it has a continental type of climate characterized by extreme variations of temperature, both seasonally and daily. Very high altitudes modify the climate in the cold, snow-covered northern mountains; temperatures on the Balochistan Plateau are somewhat higher. Along the coastal strip, the climate is modified by sea breezes. In the rest of the country, temperatures reach great heights in the summer; the mean temperature during June is 38 °F in the plains, the highest temperatures can exceed 47 °C . In the summer, hot winds called Loo blow across the plains during the day. Trees shed their leaves to avoid loss of moisture. The dry, hot weather is broken occasionally by dust storms and thunderstorms that temporarily lower the temperature. Evenings are cool; the diurnal variation in temperature may be as much as 11C to 17C. Winters are cold, with minimum mean temperatures in Punjab of about 4 °C in January, and sub-zero temperatures in the far north and Balochistan. The chizer is a mixed dog breed originating in the United States of America. Chizers are a mix of the Chihuahua and the miniature schnauzer. This breed is NOT recognized by the American Kennel Club. The chizer has a combination of looks from both breeds of dogs, and can vary depending upon the breakdown of the breed. General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights.

Bambi is the title character in Felix Salten's 1923 novel "Bambi, A Life in the Woods" and its sequel "Bambi's Children", as well as the Disney animated films "Bambi" and "Bambi II". The character of Bambi also appears in Salten’s novels "Perri" and "Fifteen Rabbits". Lawrence L. "Larry" Morey (March 26, 1905 – May 8, 1971) was an American lyricist and screenwriter.

The Prospect Plaza Houses was a 4.53 acre complex owned by the New York City Housing Authority in the Ocean Hill section of Brooklyn. It had four buildings, 12 and 15-stories tall with 368 apartments. Completed June 30, 1974, it is bordered by St. Marks and Sterling Place, Howard and Saratoga Avenues. At one time the residents numbered approximately 1,171 residents. Today there are no residents. Many residents left after signing a deal under a plan called HOPE VI. According to reports the deal offered residents of Prospect Plaza Houses temporary townhouse styled housing while their apartments were renovated. Many of these residents were instead given vouchers to alternative Section 8 housing. Many former residents have expressed dissatisfaction with what they claim was an unfair deal to remove them in order for the city to turn the buildings into condominiums and bring in more money. Sriniwaspuri (Hindi: श्रीनिवासपुरी ) is a small Colony located in the southern part of Delhi, India. This Colony has mainly two sub-colonies - a government colony and a private colony. The government colony has Type-I and Type-II flats and few type 3 flats above i block market under General Pool Residential Accommodation of Central Government maintained by CPWD, and residents here are employees of various Central and attached government offices and their family members. The private colony was initially developed as J.J.Colony Sriniwaspuri. The original residents of this JJ Colony had been residing at Bela Road Jhuggi Basti near Rajghat and were Rajasthani and Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Janghi. Being poor, they had been working in and around the Purani Delhi area, the Yamuna area, etc. Most of them were labourers, masons, etc. In 1961, due to a fire accident this Juggi Basti had burnt. Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, then the Prime Minister of India, allotted 80 Sq.Yds Plots with a loan of Rs.1000 to every family to build homes. First, 94 Plots in J Block were allotted to Rajasthani families, and Blocks K, L, M, N and O were allotted to the remaining people. Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Jhangi people were largest at that time too. Therefore, it is clear that most of the original residents of Sriniwaspuri residing in Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O have been residing in Sriniwaspuri since 1961, and they may have been residing in Delhi since 1951 or earlier. Thereafter, local people and other people came in this Colony and encroached upon the land, resulting in the more recent P, Q, R, S, and T blocks. The difference may be seen easily that on one hand J.J. Colony having Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O has well planned roads and buildings, whereas Blocks P, Q, R, S, and T are congested. This part is also known as the private colony wxtension. The private colony extension of Sriniwaspuri grapples with basic issues such as water supply, electricity, and encroachment. This part of Sriniwaspuri has many unregulated businesses such as provisional stores, dairies, and confectionery shops. Over the years, the place has commercialised so much that many residents have started leaving the place. Master Sergeant Ronald Greer, USMC is a fictional character from the science fiction television series "Stargate Universe", the third live-action series from the "Stargate" franchise centering on a group of 80 soldiers and civilians trapped on the Ancient vessel "Destiny".

The Exide lead contamination, in southeast Los Angeles County, California, United States, came from a battery recycling plant that emitted lead, arsenic and other dangerous pollutants over decades that contaminated as many as 10,000 homes in half a dozen working-class, Latino communities near the plant. Exide Technologies, owner of the lead-acid battery smelter located in Vernon, agreed in 2015 to close the facility while the massive cleanup of the contaminated soil will take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The residents have expressed outrage over the failure of state regulators to act as the plant was allowed to operate without a full permit while documented violations were occurring. The Department of Toxic Substances Control, which allowed the plant to operate, is in charge of the cleanup and is finding that the many residents do not trust them. The residents must give them permission to test the soil around their home yet many feel betrayed by this government agency. As of 2012, 21.4% of the population in San Francisco was of Chinese descent, and at least 150,000 Chinese American residents. The Chinese are the largest Asian American subgroup in San Francisco.

A proposed Islamic cemetery at Farmersville in Collin County, Texas became the subject of controversy in 2015 when local residents expressed opposition to the prospect of Muslims being buried near their town. After a consortium of local mosques purchased a plot of land outside the city limits to provide a burial ground for the county's Muslims, the local authorities unanimously granted permission for the plans. However, opposition grew among local residents and the proposals were vehemently denounced in public forums where many residents expressed strongly anti-Islamic sentiments as the basis for their opposition. Council members and planning officials reported receiving death threats and threats were also made to desecrate the site with pigs' blood and severed pigs' heads. The council emphasized that there was little it could do to prevent the cemetery going ahead, as it was bound by local and state planning regulations.

The source of the 3 mi river is Turkey Creek Bay, which is the northern beginning of the Econlockhatchee River Swamp that extends to Lake Conlin, the source of the Econlockhatchee River. From Turkey Creek Bay, the creek flows north and goes under Wewahootee Road and then State Road 528, commonly known as the "Beachline Expressway". A tributary of the creek itself, the Green Branch, joins Turkey Creek at about 1100 ft before Turkey Creek joins the Econlockhatchee at . The Estrella River is a 28.5 mi tributary river in eastern San Luis Obispo County, California. The river forms at the confluence of Cholame Creek, from the north, and San Juan Creek, from the south, near the town of Shandon. From there it flows west-northwest to its confluence with the Salinas River, of which it is a tributary, 8 miles (12.8 km) north of Paso Robles. Cholame Creek has its headwaters on the southwest side of Middle Mountain and its tributary, Little Cholame Creek, begins on the northeast side. The creek drains the Cholame Valley, which is bordered by Diablo Range on the east and Cholame Hills, a northern extension of the Temblor Range, on the west. The average precipitation in the area ranges from 11 to , increasing northward. Paradise Creek is a 9.6 mi tributary of Brodhead Creek in the Poconos of eastern Pennsylvania in the United States. The Ventura River, located in western Ventura County in southern California, United States, flows through an eponymous narrow valley with steeply sloped sides. The smallest of the three major rivers in Ventura County, the Ventura River main stem begins at the confluence of Matilija Creek and North Fork Matilija Creek, 16.2 mi from the Pacific Ocean. Matilija Creek is Ventura River's most significant headwater and tributary, and adds 17.3 miles to the length of the river's main drainage. San Antonio Creek, the river's second most significant tributary, joins the river from the east halfway to the ocean; Coyote Creek enters the river from the west and Cañada Larga Creek from the east a few of miles downstream. In its final stretch, the Ventura River flows through the Ventura River estuary, which extends from about the 101 Freeway bridge to the Pacific Ocean. Tomichi Creek is a 71.8 mi tributary of the Gunnison River in Gunnison County, Colorado. Tomichi Creek originates north and west of Monarch Pass and flows to the southwest along the base of Monarch Mountain. Congress Creek drains into Tomichi west of Old Monarch Pass where it flows south toward Sargents. Agape Creek flows into Tomichi just north of Sargents where Marshall Creek flows from Marshall Pass. Just below Sargents, Long Branch Creek, flowing out of Baldy Lake from the south, enters Tomichi Creek which takes a westward course where Needle Creek Reservoir drains into Tomichi east of Doyleville. Hot Springs Reservoir drains down Wanita Canyon flowing into Tomichi Creek just west of Doyleville. The Tomichi Valley is a semi-wide valley allowing Tomichi Creek to meander and split into several waterways creating an excellent livestock range and being largely private ranch lands. At Parlin, Quartz Creek flows from Pitkin and Ohio into Tomichi Creek. Tomichi continues its westward journey, slightly northwest, where the Cochetopa Creek drains into Tomichi at State Highway 114 from the south at the intersection of U.S. Highway 50 and continues west to Gunnison where it enters the Gunnison River. A map can be viewed at the BLM Colorado website here. Cow Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 35 mi long, in north central Montana in the United States. Cow Creek rises in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri approximately 25 mi northeast of Winifred, Montana—or 22 mi upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge. Cow Creek flows down to the Missouri in a canyon that passes through the Missouri Breaks, which are severely eroded badlands that extend out on either side from the Missouri River. The floor of Cow Creek canyon provided a pathway of travel from the Montana plains north of the river, down to the Missouri – at the mouth of Cow Creek, Cow Island made fording the Missouri easier – a steep but short trail on the south bank of the Missouri opposite Cow Creek completed this route which led from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern Montana plains. This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries. During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west. In 1877 the Nez Perce Indian Tribe, fleeing to Canada, had several skirmishes along Cow Creek including the "Battle of Cow Island", and several days later at a camp on Cow Creek the Nez Perce, thinking themselves now beyond the reach of the U.S. Army, made the fateful decision to slow down, rather than push on for the Canada–US border. Today, modern highways have by passed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and the nomadic Indian are gone. Cow Creek is dormant, in one of the most remote spots of the isolated regions of the vast area known as the Montana Missouri Breaks. Cedar Creek is an 11.2 mi tributary of the South Fork Eel River in Mendocino County in the U.S. state of California. The creek begins southeast of Red Mountain, at an elevation of 778 ft . It makes an S-curve west-northwest then bends sharply south, dropping into the valley of the South Fork Eel. The confluence is south of the city of Leggett, on the river's right bank. The only named tributary of Cedar Creek is Little Cedar Creek, a headwaters tributary. Big Dann Creek joins the South Fork Eel on the same bank, just upstream of Cedar Creek, while the next major tributary downstream of Cedar is Rock Creek. The Cedar Creek watershed is rugged and has few tributaries. Brodhead Creek is a 21.9 mi tributary of the Delaware River in the Poconos of eastern Pennsylvania in the United States. Paradise Creek (1989–2011) was a millionaire American Thoroughbred racehorse and successful sire. He was bred in Kentucky by Bertram R. Firestone and raced under the same Firestone banner as his owner. He finished racing with a record of 14-7-1 in 25 starts with career earnings of $3,401,415. Paradise Creek was best known for his wins in the grade one Washington, D.C. International Stakes and the grade one Arlington Million. In 1994 he became the only horse ever to have won both prestigious turf races of the United States. Cadwallader Creek is an important tributary of the Hurley River in the Bridge River Country of the British Columbia Interior, Canada, most notable for its role as the home of the Bralorne and Pioneer Mines and associated gold claims and workings. Less than twenty miles in length, the creek is joined by Noel Creek within the area of the town of Bralorne, and just below Bralorne joins the Hurley River just above Hurley Falls and that river's ten-mile canyon prior to its own confluence with the Bridge River near the town Gold Bridge. Standard Creek, a short tributary of Cadwallader Creek near its upper end, connects via McGillvray Pass to the creek of the same name and, on Anderson Lake far below, the resort townlet of McGillivray Falls. One-time plans to build a cog railway to the mines from the Pacific Great Eastern at McGillivary Falls were never fulfilled.

Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi. He rarely discussed "Halakot", and his discussions of them were not original ("Shab. " 64b). Once he recited a "Halakah" in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: "Is it his own? It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah" (M. Ḳ. 24b). In the "Haggadah", he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original. Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments ("Ex. " xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices. He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, "That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments ("Zeb." 88b; " 'Ar." 16a; compare "Yer. Yoma," vii. 44b; "Lev. R." x.). Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush ("Ex." iii. 2-4) he remarks, "The Holy One—blessed be He! —said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says ["Ezek. " viii. 3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree ["Gen." xviii. 4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written ["Jer." xxiii. 24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said ["Job," xxxviii. 1, xl. 6], "The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind"" ("Ex. R." iii., where the interpretation is somewhat forced). Lev Vladimirovich Kuleshov (Russian: Лев Влади́мирович Кулешо́в ; 13 January [O.S. 1 January] 1899 – 29 March 1970) was a Russian and Soviet filmmaker and film theorist, one of the founders of the world's first film school, the Moscow Film School. He was given the title People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1969. He was intimately involved in development of the style of film making known as Soviet montage, especially it's psychological underpinning, including the use of editing and the cut to emotionally influence the audience, a principle known as the Kuleshov effect. He also developed the theory of creative geography, which is the use of the action around a cut to connect otherwise disparate settings into a cohesive narrative. Pamela B.

Levni Yilmaz (born 1973) is a San Francisco based independent film maker, artist and publisher, best known for his “Tales of Mere Existence” animated comic series. Eliezer ben Jacob I (Hebrew: אליעזר בן יעקב) was a Tanna of the 1st century; contemporary of Eleazar b. Ḥisma and Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and senior of Judah ben Ilai (Pes. 32a, 39b; Yalḳ. , Lev. 638). Of his personal history nothing is known, except that he had seen the Temple at Jerusalem and was familiar with the specific purposes of its many apartments, a subject on which he was considered an authority (Yoma 16b). Some of the details, however, he eventually forgot, and was reminded of them by Abba Saul b. Baṭnit (Mid. ii. 5, v. 4). Simon b. 'Azzai, R. Akiva's contemporary, relates that he had discovered a genealogical roll wherein was stated, "The Mishnah of R. Eliezer b. Jacob is only a 'ḳab' [small in proportion], but clear" (משנת ראב"י קב ונקי, Yeb. 49b), wherefore subsequent generations generally adopted Eliezer's views as law (Yeb. 60a; Bek. 23b). Pamela B. Green is an American film producer and director known for her work in feature film titles and motion graphics. She is the director and producer of the documentary "Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blache". Pamela B. Davis, MD, PhD is a pediatric pulmonologist specializing in cystic fibrosis research.

Contrary to popular belief, the player does not have to play at least a year in college basketball, as the player can choose to instead play in another professional league (especially overseas) like Brandon Jennings or Emmanuel Mudiay in Italy and China respectively, simply take the year off, such as the case with Satnam Singh Bhamara, or even hold themselves back a year in high school before declaring for the draft, such as the case with Thon Maker.

He formed a secret revolutionary society from among the members of the circle, which included the young Fyodor Dostoevsky. After the government of Tsar Nicholas I arrested the members of the Petrashevsky Circle in 1849, Speshnev was interrogated, threatened with torture, and eventually sentenced, along with Dostoevsky, Petrashevsky and others, to execution by firing squad. The sentence was commuted to hard labour in Siberia, but the prisoners were only informed of this after enduring a mock execution. Roger (Gilbert) Lancelyn Green (2 November 1918 – 8 October 1987) was a British biographer and children's writer.

**Question:** Arbutus and Aspidistra are what types of plants?
**Answer:** flowering plants

**Context:**
Aspidistra is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae, native to eastern and southeastern Asia, particularly China and Vietnam. They grow in shade under trees and shrubs. Their leaves arise more or less directly from ground level, where their flowers also appear. The number of species known has increased considerably from the 1980s onwards, with around 100 accepted as of July 2013 . " Aspidistra elatior" is common worldwide as a foliage house plant that is very tolerant of neglect. It and other species can also be grown in shade outside, where they are generally hardy to -5 C . Imazapyr is a non-selective herbicide used for the control of a broad range of weeds including terrestrial annual and perennial grasses and broadleaved herbs, woody species, and riparian and emergent aquatic species. It is used to eliminate "Lithocarpus densiflorus" (Tan Oak) and "Arbutus menziesii" (Pacific Madrone). Additionally, imazapyr is used to control annual and perennial grass and broadleaved weeds, brush, vines and many deciduous trees. Imazapyr is absorbed by the leaves and roots, and moves rapidly through the plant. It accumulates in the meristem region (active growth region) of the plant. In plants, imazapyr disrupts protein synthesis and interferes with cell growth and DNA synthesis. There are currently two main types of power plants operating in Nigeria: (1) hydro-electric and (2) thermal or fossil fuel power plants. With a total installed capacity of 8457.6MW (81 percent of total) in early 2014, thermal power plants (gas-fired plants) dominates the Nigerian power supply mix. Electricity production from hydroelectric sources (% of total) in Nigeria was reported at 17.59 % in 2014, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. There have been two main types of fossil fuel/thermal power plants in the country: (i) coal-fired and (ii) natural gas-fired. Silene menziesii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Menzies' campion and Menzies' catchfly. It is native to western North America from Alaska through the western half of Canada to the southwestern United States. It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range. It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa. In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long. It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower. Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both. Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals. The petals are white with two lobes at the tips. The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers. The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male. A trellis (treillage) is an architectural structure, usually made from an open framework or lattice of interwoven or intersecting pieces of wood, bamboo or metal that is normally made to support and display climbing plants, especially shrubs. There are many types of trellis for different places and for different plants, from agricultural types, especially in viticulture, which are covered at vine training systems, to garden uses for climbers such as grapevines, clematis, ivy, and climbing roses or other support based growing plants. The rose trellis is especially common in Europe and other rose-growing areas, and many climbing rose varieties require a trellis to reach their potential as garden plants. Some plants will climb and wrap themselves round a trellis without much artificial help being needed while others need training by passing the growing shoots through the trellis and/or tying them to the framework. Aspidistra nikolaii is a plant species of the genus "Aspidistra" that was one of the new 21 species of plants and animals recently discovered in the Annamite Range of central Vietnam. It was named after a late Russian botanist named Nicolai Arnautov. It has a dark blue flower that is almost black. Self-pollination is when pollen from the same plant arrives at the stigma of a flower (in flowering plants) or at the ovule (in Gymnosperms). There are two types of self-pollination: In autogamy, pollen is transferred to the stigma of the same flower. In geitonogamy, pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same flowering plant, or from microsporangium to ovule within a single (monoecious) Gymnosperm. Some plants have mechanisms that ensure autogamy, such as flowers that do not open (cleistogamy), or stamens that move to come into contact with the stigma. The term selfing that is often used as a synonym, is not limited to self-pollination, but also applies to other types of self fertilization. Arbutus is a genus of 11 accepted species of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, native to warm temperate regions of the Mediterranean, western Europe, the Canary Islands (Teneriffa) and North America. The name "Arbutus" was taken from Latin, where it referred to "A. unedo". Thorius munificus is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Mexico and only known from near its type locality near Las Vigas, Veracruz. Its natural habitats are pine-oak and pine forests, woodlands, and "Arbutus" forests with abundant shrubby and ericaceous plants. The species is threatened by habitat loss caused by logging, agriculture, and human settlement. False vivipary is an abnormal condition found in many types of plants in which a plantlet is produced where the flower should appear. It is not a completely understood topic, but some say it could be caused by a hormonal mistake. The plantlet which appears can be rooted and grown like normal plants. This abnormal behavior can occasionally be seen in many types of carnivorous plants.

**Question:** who is younger Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville ?
**Answer:** Keith Bostic

**Context:**
Ken Herock (born July 16, 1941, in Pittsburgh) was an American college and professional football player who played tight end. He played collegiately at West Virginia and professionally in the American Football League, where he played for the AFL Champion Oakland Raiders in the second AFL-NFL World Championship Game, held after the 1967 season. He attended Munhall High School in Pittsburgh. His six-year pro career was spent with the Oakland Raiders, who he helped win the AFL title, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Boston Patriots. After his playing career ended, Herock was a player personnel executive in the NFL with the Raiders, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Atlanta Falcons. He is known for trading Brett Favre from the Falcons to the Green Bay Packers at the urging of head coach Jerry Glanville. The 1990 Atlanta Falcons season was the franchise's 25th season in the National Football League (NFL). Jerry Glanville was hired to be the team's new coach. The franchise changed their helmets from red to black. Atlanta looked to improve on its 3-13 record from 1989. The team did improve on its 3-13 record, finishing 5-11, but the Falcons missed the playoffs for the eighth straight season. The season started out pretty well for Atlanta, as they beat playoff contenders Houston, New Orleans, and Cincinnati at home. The team sat at 3-4 after their win against Cincinnati. It then lost seven games in a row before winning its last two to end the season. Atlanta went 5-3 at home, but winless on the road, which cost them a trip to the postseason. The Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American Football team playing in the National Football League. Their 1987 season saw the team record an 8-7 record and fail to reach the playoffs. Noll was renowned as a stoic character, but in complete contrast was his reaction to Jerry Glanville, the head coach of the Oilers. After the Steelers second meeting, Noll in the post game handshake grabbed Glanville and told him he'd better watch out or he'd get jumped on. This was in reaction to Glanville's earlier comments on how the Oilers field was the 'house of pain' and his prediction that his players would intentionally hurt the Steelers.

A native of Washington, Davis grew up in Oregon, where he started his coaching career as a high school football coach. Davis is now widely regarded as the 'godfather' of the run and shoot offense. Jerry Michael Glanville (born October 14, 1941) is a former American football player and coach, former NASCAR driver and owner, and sportscaster. He served as head coach of the Houston Oilers from 1986 to 1990 and the Atlanta Falcons from 1990 to 1994, compiling a career NFL record of 63–73. From 2007 to 2009, he was the Head Football Coach at Portland State University, tallying a mark of 9–24. Glanville has worked as an analyst on HBO's "Inside the NFL", CBS's "The NFL Today"/"NFL on CBS" and Fox's coverage of the NFL. He has also raced on the Automobile Racing Club of America circuit.

The ACM award-winning band are also bringing the star power on the album, with guest appearances from Willie Nelson, John Anderson, Colt Ford and former NFL coach, Jerry Glanville, on a special 20th Anniversary version of the signature smash, “Trashy Women.” The 1989 season was the Houston Oilers 30th season and their 20th in the National Football League (NFL). The franchise scored 365 points while the defense gave up 412 points. Their record of 9 wins and 7 losses resulted in a second-place finish in the AFC Central Division. The Oilers appeared once on Monday Night Football and appeared in the playoffs for the third consecutive year. It would be Jerry Glanville’s final year as the Oilers coach. Perhaps one of the lowest points of the season for the Oilers was their second to last game against division rival Bengals. The Bengals thumped the Oilers 61-7 in that game. This loss marked the worst defeat for the team during its tenure in Houston. As of 2017, the worst defeat for the team known either as the Oilers or the Titans was in 2009 when they lost 59-0 to the New England Patriots. It was the second time the Oilers had allowed 61 points to the Bengals, the other being a 61-17 loss at home in 1972. William Keith Bostic (born January 17, 1961) is a former professional American football player who played for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). During his career he played safety for the Houston Oilers and the Cleveland Browns. Bostic served as the Oiler defensive captain under Jerry Glanville.

**Question:** Where did Henri Christophe and other slaves hold an uprising from 1791 to 1804 that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery and ruled by non-whites and former captives?
**Answer:** Saint-Domingue

**Context:**
Jean-Baptiste Sans-Souci was a leader of rebel slaves during the Haitian Revolution. He was assassinated by rival black rebel leader, Henri Christophe, in 1803, shortly before Haiti won its independence. Sans-Souci is notable as one of the most effective military leaders during the revolution, particularly against French forces led by Charles Leclerc in 1802 and 1803. Henri Christophe: A Chronicle in Seven Scenes (1949) is the first play by Derek Walcott, written when he was 19 years old. It is about the self-declared King Henri Christophe of Haiti, a former slave who became a general under Toussaint Louverture in the Haitian Revolution. Later, he ruled the northern part of the nation from 1807 to 1820, first as president and from 1811 as king. At the time the South was governed by the president Alexandre Pétion, a "gens de couleur" (free man of color; in Haiti, such people were generally of French and African descent). Henri Christophe (] ; 6 October 1767 – 8 October 1820; used the anglicized version of Henry Christopher) was a former slave of Bambara ethnicity, and perhaps of Ibo descent, and key leader in the Haitian Revolution, which succeeded in gaining independence from France in 1804. In 1805 he took part under Jean-Jacques Dessalines in the capturing of Santo Domingo (now Dominican Republic), against French forces who acquired the colony from Spain in the Treaty of Basel. The Northern Kingdom of Haiti (French: Royaume d'Haïti, Haitian Creole: Ini an Ayiti) was the state established by Henri Christophe on 28 March 1811 when he was self-proclaimed as King Henri I after having previously ruled as president. This was Haiti's second attempt at monarchical rule, as Jean-Jacques Dessalines had previously ruled over the Empire of Haiti. Following the assassination of Emperor Jacques, the country was split. Henri ruled over the north of the country as President of the State of Haiti and Alexandre Pétion, a free person of color, ruled as President of the Republic of Haiti in the south. The Haitian Revolution (French: "Révolution haïtienne" ] ) was a successful anti-slavery and anti-colonial insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign nation of Haiti. It began in 1791 and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence. It was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state, which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives. With the recent increase in Haitian Revolutionary Studies, it is now widely seen as a defining moment in the history of racism in the Atlantic World. François-Ferdinand Henri Christophe (1794 October 7, 1805) was the eldest son and first child of Field General Henri Christophe, future King of Haiti, and his wife, Marie-Louise Coidavid. Because he was both born and died before his father's ascension as King, in 1811, he was never Prince Royal of Haiti, nor was he ever heir apparent to the throne. Pompée Valentin Vastey (1781 - 1820), or Pompée Valentin, Baron de Vastey, was a Haitian writer, educator, and politician. Vastey was what people at the time called a "mulatto," because he was born to a white French father and a black Haitian mother. He served as secretary to King Henri Christophe and tutor to Christophe's son, Victor Henri. Vastey also claimed to have fought in Toussaint’s army and is said to have been the second cousin of the French novelist and playwright Alexandre Dumas (Daut 56; see also, Griggs 181). Vastey is best known for his essays on the history and contemporary circumstances of Haiti. The Citadelle Laferrière or, Citadelle Henry Christophe, or simply the Citadelle (English: Citadel ), is a large mountaintop fortress in Nord, Haiti, located on top of the mountain Bonnet a L’Eveque, approximately 17 mi south of the city of Cap-Haïtien, 10 mi southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and 5 mi uphill from the town of Milot. It is one of the largest fortresses in the Americas and was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a World Heritage Site in 1982—along with the nearby Sans-Souci Palace. The mountaintop fortress has itself become an icon of Haiti. The Citadel was built by Henri Christophe, a key leader during the Haitian slave rebellion (1791–1804), after Haiti gained independence from France at the beginning of the 19th century. Slavery in Ethiopia existed for centuries. The practice formed an integral part of Ethiopian society, from its earliest days through to the 20th century. Slaves were traditionally drawn from the Nilotic groups inhabiting Ethiopia's southern hinterland. War captives were another source of slaves, though the perception, treatment and duties of these prisoners was markedly different. Slaves were also sold abroad as part of the Arab slave trade, serving as concubines, bodyguards, servants and treasurers. In response to pressure by Western Allies of World War II, Ethiopia officially abolished slavery and involuntary servitude after having regained its independence in 1942. On 26 August 1942, Haile Selassie issued a proclamation outlawing slavery. The State of Haiti (French: État d'Haïti, Haitian: Leta an Ayiti) was the name of the state in northern Haiti. It was created on October 17, 1806 following the overthrow of the Empire of Haiti following the assassination of Emperor Jacques I. The northern State of Haiti was ruled by Henri Christophe originally as "Provisional Chief of the Haitian Government" from October 17, 1806 until February 17, 1807 when he became "President of the State of Haiti". The 1807 constitution for the State of Haiti made the post of president a position for life with the president having the power to appoint his successor. On March 28, 1811 President Henri was proclaimed King Henry I, thereby dissolving the State of Haiti and creating the Kingdom of Haiti.

**Question:** How many termini does the train that runs on the C&M subdivision and runs between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest serve?
**Answer:** two termini

**Context:**
The Mainstreeter was a passenger train on the Northern Pacific Railway between Chicago, Illinois, and the Pacific Northwest from 1952 to 1971. When the "North Coast Limited" got a faster schedule in November 1952 the Mainstreeter was introduced, running roughly on the North Coast's old schedule but via Helena. Unlike the North Coast the "Mainstreeter" was not a true streamliner as it carried both new lightweight and traditional heavyweight coaches. It replaced another train, the "Alaskan". The name referred to the Northern Pacific's slogan, "Main Street of the Northwest." While Amtrak did not retain the train as part of its initial route structure, it created a new train named the "North Coast Hiawatha" several months afterwards. This train ran until 1979. The Empire Builder is a daily passenger train operated by Amtrak that runs between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. The route has two segments west of Spokane that serve two termini, Seattle and Portland. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee. The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee. The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort. Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as "LD" which is part of the Cincinnati Division. From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee. At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash "Amqui" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal. Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as "SA" and operates on AAR58. There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui. From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track). There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1. Few more miles southward, the next major location appears. At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal. From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago. The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track. From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track. From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike. The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of "0BA" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal. At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard. Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals. This location is known as North Radnor. The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta. The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures. The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main. Both lines remain double track for a while. The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0. Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south. From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge. At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40. From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10. After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown. On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present. This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it. The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye. The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic. The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal. The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0. The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 "11th Avenue" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track. The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at "Shops". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until "Sellars", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the "walkway" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as "Long Lead". And now, the Terminal splits into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, "SC". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track. And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. Canadian Pacific's Galt Subdivision is Canadian Pacific's 114.6 mile long section of its Montréal-Detroit freight corridor. It is located in Southern Ontario, Canada. Getting its name from the historic City of Galt (now the City of Cambridge) that it passes through, the track runs from the bustling hub of Toronto, Ontario, to London, Ontario. GO Transit's Milton GO train service operates on this line from Toronto Union Station to Milton GO station. The rest of the line plays host to mixed freight and intermodal traffic, from Toronto to termini like Detroit, and Chicago. This Central Ontario line also had CP passenger rail service till 1971 when it was eliminated. Passenger rail service would be partly restored halfway through the line through the introduction of GO Transit operations in 1981 westward only as far as the Town of Milton.

The Pacific Northwest languages are the indigenous languages of the Pacific Northwest of North America. This is a geographic term and does not imply any common heritage for these languages. In fact, the Pacific Northwest is an area of exceptional linguistic diversity and contains languages belonging to a large number of (apparently) unrelated families. However, the close proximity of multiple languages has created many opportunities for mutual interaction, with the result that the Pacific Northwest forms a linguistic area, with many areal features that are shared across language families. The Olympian and its successor the Olympian Hiawatha were passenger trains operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the "Milwaukee Road") between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest. The "Olympian" operated from 1911 to 1947 and was, along with its running mate the "Columbian", the first all-steel train to operate in the Pacific Northwest. The streamlined "Olympian Hiawatha" operated from 1947 to 1961 and was one of several Milwaukee Road trains to carry the name "Hiawatha." The "Olympian Hiawatha" was designed by industrial designer Brooks Stevens and included the distinctive glassed-in "Skytop" observation-sleeping cars.

**Context:**
The 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment was a cavalry regiment recruited from Southern Unionists that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was the only predominantly-white Union regiment from Alabama. Of the 2,678 white Alabamians who enlisted in the Union Army, 2,066 served in the 1st Alabama Cavalry. The Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, normally referred to as the Royal Australian Artillery (RAA), is a Regiment of the Australian Army descended from the original colonial artillery units prior to Australia's federation. Australia’s first guns were landed from HMS "Sirius" and a small earthen redoubt built, near the present day Macquarie Place, to command the approaches to Sydney Cove. The deployment of these guns represents the origins of artillery in Australia. These and subsequent defences, as well as field guns, were operated by marines and the soldiers of infantry regiments stationed in Australia. The first Royal Artillery unit arrived in Australia in 1856 and began a succession of gunner units which ended with the withdrawal of the imperial forces in 1870 resulting in the raising of the Victorian Artillery Corps in Melbourne in 1870 and the New South Wales Artillery in Sydney in 1871. The First World War saw the raising of 60 field, 20 howitzer and two siege batteries along with the heavy and medium trench mortar batteries. Until 19 September 1962 the Australian Artillery was referred to as the 'Royal Australian Artillery', however on this date HM Queen Elizabeth II granted the RAA the title of 'The Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery'. The Regiment today consists of Regular and Reserve units. The Warwickshire Royal Horse Artillery was a Territorial Force Royal Horse Artillery battery that was formed in Warwickshire in 1908. It was the first Territorial Force artillery unit to go overseas on active service, spending the whole of the First World War on the Western Front, mostly with 1st Cavalry Division and 29th Division. A second line battery, 2/1st Warwickshire RHA, also served on the Western Front in 1917 and 1918 as part of an Army Field Artillery Brigade. Post-war it was reconstituted as a Royal Field Artillery battery. 2nd Siege Artillery Battery was formed in Victoria during April 1915. The battery departed Melbourne on 17 July 1915 and served on the Western Front during World War I. The battery along with the 1st Siege Artillery Battery made up the 1st Siege Artillery Brigade. 2nd Siege Artillery Battery was renamed the 55th Siege Artillery Battery on 28 September 1915. The battery was equipped first with four BL 9.2 inch Howitzers and then 6 from July 1917.

The 1st Arkansas Light Artillery, originally known as the Fort Smith Artillery (1861), was a Confederate artillery battery that served during the American Civil War. The unit was actually a pre-war volunteer militia company which was activated as part of the Arkansas State Troops and mustered out of state service following the Battle of Wilson's Creek. The unit immediately re-organized and re-enlisted for Confederate service. The unit spent the majority of the war in the western theater, fighting as part of the Confederate Army of Tennessee. The unit is also known as Reid's Battery, Provence's Battery, Humphreys' Battery and finally The Battle of Fort Pillow, also known as the Fort Pillow massacre, was fought on April 12, 1864, at Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River in Henning, Tennessee, during the American Civil War. The battle ended with a massacre of Union troops (most of them African American soldiers) attempting to surrender, by soldiers under the command of Confederate Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Military historian David J. Eicher concluded, "Fort Pillow marked one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history." The 1st Arkansas Infantry (1861–1865) was a Confederate Army infantry regiment during the American Civil War. The regiment was raised in April 1861 by Colonel Thompson B. Flournoy. It moved first to Virginia, but transferred back to Tennessee and served the rest of the war in the western theater, seeing action in the Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia campaigns. Following its depletion in numbers, the regiment was consolidated several times with other Arkansas regiments, finally merging in 1865 into the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment. There were three regiments known as "1st Arkansas" during the war. The second unit with the designation of "1st Arkansas" was the 1st Infantry, Arkansas State Troops, which was mustered into Confederate service at Pitman's Ferry, Arkansas, on 23 July 1861, under the command of Colonel Patrick Cleburne; this unit was eventually redesignated as the 15th Arkansas Volunteer Infantry. The third unit bearing the title "1st Arkansas" was the 1st Arkansas Volunteer Infantry, which served with the Union Army. Turku Coastal Regiment (Finnish: Turun Rannikkorykmentti ) was a Finnish coastal artillery unit operating in the Turku area and Archipelago Sea. It was formed on 10.9.1939 as Turku Sector ("Turun Lohko") as part of the neutrality guard and later Winter War coastal sector system from a peace time "1st Independent Coastal Artillery Battalion" ("1. Erillinen Rannikkotykistöpatteristo").

The Joe Bell Site (9MG28) is an archaeological site located in Morgan County, Georgia underneath Lake Oconee, but prior to the 1970s, it was located south of the mouth of the Apalachee River on the western bank of the Oconee River. The junction of these two rivers could be seen from the site. This site was first visited by Marshall Williams in 1968 at the suggestion of the site’s landowner, Joe Bell, who had discovered various artifacts while the site was being regularly plowed. Because of Interstate construction, Marshall Williams and Mark Williams discovered this site during surface surveys and excavations of the plowed areas. The site was excavated and analyzed by Mark Williams as part of his PhD dissertation. During the 1969 excavations, four areas within the site were designated for excavation. In Areas 1-3 various five foot square units were excavated. No excavations were done in Area 4 in 1969. Large quantities of small potsherds were discovered during these excavations, and they ranged from the Duvall Phase in Area 1 to Bell Phase in Areas 2-4. As part of the 1969 excavations, a road grading machine took off the topsoil of twelve strips on the site. This uncovered Features 1 and 2, and they were completely excavated. In 1977, the site was revisited by Marshall Williams and Mark Williams. Since various plans threatened this site, major excavations took place from June 15, 1977 until September 16, 1977 by Mark Williams. Most of the work centered on Area 2 or the Bell Phase portion of the site. The Bell Phase portion of this site was probably no more the 1.5 acres .

P.S.K. are the initials for Park Side Killas, a street gang with which Schoolly D was affiliated. The highly influential song is considered the first hardcore rap song and features incidents of graphic sex, gunplay, drug references and one of the first uses of the word "nigga" in a rap song (earlier uses include "Scoopy Rap" and "Family Rap" in 1979, and "New York New York" in 1983). "She's a Woman" is a song by the Beatles, written mainly by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. John Lennon contributed to the lyrics and middle eight (the bridge). The song was finished in the studio the morning of the session. It was released as the B-side to "I Feel Fine" in 1964, their last single release that year. It reached number 4 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 from frequent airplay.

The 12" single featured a dub mix of "A New Day" as the A-side and "A New Day" as the B-side. The 7" single featured a shorter version of "A New Day" as the A-side and "Dance Day" as the B-side. A completely different version of "A New Day", which was not a mix, later appeared on the 2008 reissue of Killing Joke's fifth studio album, "Night Time". The single reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart. A promotional video was filmed for the song, marking the first time the band had made a video for a non-album single. "No Milk Today" is a song that was written by Graham Gouldman and originally recorded by British pop band Herman's Hermits. It was first released as a single by the Mancunian group in the UK in October 1966 and, with the B-side "My Reservation's Been Confirmed", enjoyed chart success, peaking at No. 7 in the UK Singles Chart. Although not released as a single in the US ("Dandy" was released in its place with the same B-side), it was popular enough to become a moderate hit when it was released there as the B-side to "There's a Kind of Hush", reaching No. 35 in 1967 (the A-side reaching No. 4). It was also a major hit in many European countries. "White Horse" is a 1983 song written by Tim Stahl and John Guldberg of the Danish duo Laid Back. The song was released as the B-side of their single "Sunshine Reggae" which became a major hit in several European countries. In the US, the A-side was mainly ignored and it was the B-side that became most successful. It was released as a single and went on to spend three weeks at number one on the Dance Charts. The single also made the top five on the R&B singles chart and peaked at number 26 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Although being played in European clubs, it failed to chart there when re-released as an A-side. "So Good To You" is a song that was written by Lynsey de Paul, and first released by Zakatek (aka Lenny Zakatek) as the B-side to his 1973 single, "I Gotcha Now", which also penned by de Paul. The single was released in 2 March 1973 and both songs were produced and arranged by de Paul. Her own version appeared in October 1973 as the B-side to her award-winning single "Won't Somebody Dance with Me", which was arranged by Christopher Gunning and produced by de Paul. In Japan, however, "So Good To You" was released as the A-side with "Won't Somebody Dance with Me" being relegated to the B-side on its release in 1974. All Music lists "So Good to You" as one of De Paul's song highlights. De Paul's version appeared for the first time on CD in 1996 on the album "Greatest Hits" and later as a track on the CD compilation "Sugar & Beyond: Anthology 1972-1974". "Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung" was a 1971 essay by Lester Bangs, later collected in a (ISBN  ). The essay, which talks about what is today called garage rock, contains the phrase, "...punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound." This is believed to be one of the first uses of the word "punk" to refer to a type of rock music. A large section of the essay is concerned with the imagined longer career of the garage band the Count Five, after their hit "Psychotic Reaction". The band split after one album, but Bangs' discussion of the imagined subsequent records is entirely fanciful. "The Earth is Dancing" (in Slovene: ""Zemlja pleše"") is a 1962 pop song, music of which was written by Mojmir Sepe based on a lyrics by Slovene poet Gregor Strniša that was awarded at the first edition of the Slovenian song festival where it was sung by a notable singer Marijana Držaj. The song became an evergreen, a popular and enduring example of Slovenian popular music. It has been since then released in a number of re-mixes. It also inspired one of the first musical videospots made in 1980s in Slovenia, at the time part of Yugoslavia, where both the videospot and the song were also popular.

**Question:** Were The Living Desert and What Would Jesus Buy? directed by the same person?
**Answer:** no

**Context:**
What Would Tyler Durden Do? (WWTDD) is a gossip blog named for the "Fight Club" character Tyler Durden, and playing on the Christian inspirational phrase 'What would Jesus do? ' The blog, which is occasionally not safe for work, is notable for publishing rumours, criticism and revealing photographs of celebrities. The posts to the blog typically consist of a report followed by commentary from the author. Its readership is primarily from the United States. In a 2006 Youth Trends survey, What Would Tyler Durden Do? was one of two blogs of the top 10 most popular websites with females aged 17–25, a popularity the researcher attributed to "Gen Y females' current adoration with content surrounding celebrities and their 'uh oh' moments." It was cited by Mashable in 2008 as one of the 30 most salacious celebrity gossip sites on the Internet. The blog explains its purpose as follows: Big Tent Revival is a Christian rock band that formed in 1991, toured extensively, disbanded in 2000, and reformed in 2012.

The first told a story about two different couples in which one trusted in Jesus through the storms of life and the other didn't. The second was used as an invitational at Harvest Crusade altar calls. The last was part of the WWJD movement that encouraged people to consider what Jesus would do in real-life situations. Crackin' Up! was Ray Stevens' twenty-fourth studio album and his fourth for MCA Records, released in 1987.

He was the son of Christoph Sonnleithner, brother of Ignaz von Sonnleithner and uncle of Franz Grillparzer and Leopold von Sonnleithner. He was a personal friend and attorney of Ludwig van Beethoven, and he wrote numerous librettos, among them, Beethoven's stage opera "Fidelio", "Faniska" by Luigi Cherubini and "Agnes Sorel" by Adalbert Gyrowetz. Maria Antonia of Austria (Maria Antonia Josepha Benedicta Rosalia Petronella; 18 January 1669 – 24 December 1692) was the eldest daughter and only surviving child of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I and his wife Margaret Theresa of Spain. She became Electress of Bavaria when she married in 1685, but died prematurely in 1692.

He descends from King Ludwig I of Bavaria in direct line and is a distant relative to the current head of the House of Wittelsbach, Franz, Duke of Bavaria and his brother, Maximilian, Duke in Bavaria. He also descends from Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph and his wife Elisabeth and from King George II of Great Britain, and is therefore a distant cousin of Elizabeth II. As a Roman Catholic he is excluded from the line for the British throne by the Act of Settlement 1701. He also descends from Isabella II of Spain, through her daughter, and Leopold´s great-grandmother, María de la Paz.

Moreover, the agreement proposed that Louis, "le Grand Dauphin", would receive Naples, Sicily, Finale, and the ports in Tuscany while Archduke Charles, the younger son of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I would receive the Spanish Netherlands. Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, would take Milan, which in turn ceded Lorraine and Bar to the Dauphin. The Treaty of London, agreed on March 25, 1700 and sometimes known as the Second Partition Treaty, was an attempt to restore the Pragmatic Sanction following the death of Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria, which had undermined the First Partition Treaty (the Treaty of Den Haag). Under the new Treaty, Archduke Charles (later Emperor Charles VI), the second son of the Emperor Leopold I, was to succeed King Charles II of Spain on his thrones and acquire his oversees colonies.

Gerold (died 799) was an Alamannian nobleman who served the Frankish King, Charlemagne, as Margrave of the Avarian March and Prefect of Bavaria in what is now South-Eastern Germany. Gerold played a significant role in the integration of Bavaria into the Frankish Kingdom during Carolingian expansion in the late 8th, and early 9th centuries. Gerold both aided the continuity of Agilofing rule of Bavaria, as well as took steps to integrate Bavarians into the wider scope of the Frankish Kingdom. Gerold was related both to the Agilofing family, the ruling class of Bavaria, as well as the Carolingian family. The Agilofings had ruled Bavaria since Duke Garibald I in 548. Gerold was born into the Agilofings, and his sister Hildegard was married to Charlemagne in 771. From these familial connections, he was appointed Prefect of Bavaria following the deposition of Duke Tassilo III in 788. Gerold was heralded as a superb military commander, giving rise to his promotion to Prefect as a defender of the eastern border of the Frankish Kingdom. In 799, Gerold is said to have fallen in battle against the Avars, shortly after the same Avars killed his ally, Erich, Duke of Friuli, through treachery. Slavery in Libya has a long history and a lasting impact on the Libyan culture. It is closely connected with the wider context of slavery in north Africa.

**Answer:** Victoria

**Context:**
The Alice River is a river located on the Cape York Peninsula of Far North Queensland, Australia. The Uw Oykangand are an Indigenous Australian people living on the southwestern part of the Cape York Peninsula, Queensland in Australia. Their neighbours to the northwest are the Yir-Yoront, Their traditional lands are around the Alice River and the Crosbie River, and further west around the Mitchell River and into Gulf Country. Luigi Maria D'Albertis (21 November 1841 – 2 September 1901) was a flamboyant Italian naturalist and explorer who, in 1876, became the first person to chart the Fly River in Papua New Guinea. He took eight weeks to steam some 580 miles up the Fly River in an Australian launch, the "Neva". On board as engineer was young Lawrence Hargrave, later to become an aviation pioneer. D'Albertis kept a pet python on board to prevent his motley crew from pilfering the stores. He also fired off exploding rockets to keep any hostile natives at bay. His expedition collected specimens of birds, plants and insects. The "Neva" forced its way upstream until brought to a halt by the shallows. They then steamed downriver to a tributary d'Albertis had named the Alice River (today known as the Ok Tedi), and d'Albertis cajoled his crew up this river with promises of gold. Eventually stricken by malaria and crippled by rheumatism in both legs, he admitted defeat. He tried once again in the following year, but did not reach as far as before, and returned to Europe. A homosexual, Goode was accompanied on his expeditions by a succession of young male companions.

**Question:** Were both the Battle of Saipan and the Battle of Manila fought by American forces?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
The South German Offensive is the general name of one of the final offensives of World War II in Europe. The offensive was led by the Seventh and Third armies of the United States along with the First Army of France. Soviet troops linked up with American forces in Czechoslovakia notably in the Battle of Slivice. The offensive was made by the US 6th Army Group to protect the US 12th Army Group's right flank and to prevent a German last stand in the Alps. However German resistance was much more fierce than in the north, which slowed the 6th Army Group's progress. However, by the end of April, many German divisions surrendered without a fight to the advancing American forces to avoid the inevitable destruction. The VI Corps of the Seventh Army linked up with the US Fifth Army, which fought through Italy, in the Alps as the Third Army advanced into Austria and Czechoslovakia, where it linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east. Fighting continued a few days after the Surrender of Germany on 8 May, due to German forces fighting west to surrender to the Americans instead of the Soviets. The Japanese 20mm Cannon Blockhouse is one of many relics of World War II on the island of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands. It is a concrete blockhouse, semi-circular in shape with a diameter of about 6 m . Its walls are 1.22 m thick with four firing ports large enough to accommodate 20mm cannons, originally equipped with steel sliding shutters. A steel door 25 mm thick provides access to the structure at the rear, sheltered by a concrete wall and covered defensively by a machine gun port. The blockhouse is located near the center of what is locally called Big Agingan Beach (Unai Dankulo Agingan), on the south coast of the island, about 20 m from the shore. It was built in some haste by the Japanese forces defending Saipan in 1944, and was captured by Allied forces early in the Battle of Saipan. The Battle of Manila (February 3, 1945 – March 3, 1945) was a major battle of the Philippine campaign of 1944-45, during the Second World War. It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater. Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle. Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation. The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945). The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. The Battle of Attu, which took place from 11–30 May 1943, was a battle fought between forces of the United States, aided by Canadian reconnaissance and fighter-bomber support, and the Empire of Japan on Attu Island off the coast of the Territory of Alaska as part of the Aleutian Islands Campaign during the American Theater and the Pacific Theater and was the only land battle of World War II fought on incorporated territory of the United States. It is also the only land battle in which Japanese and American forces fought in Arctic conditions. The Battle of Hill 609 took place at Djebel Tahent in northwestern Tunisia during the Tunisia Campaign. The battle was for control over the key strategic height Hill 609 and its surrounding area between the American forces of the U.S. II Corps and German units of the Afrika Korps. The battle proved a formative experience for the American forces - it their first clear cut victory of the campaign and has been called "the American Army's coming-of-age". The Battle of Saipan was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought on the island of Saipan in the Mariana Islands from 15 June to 9 July 1944. The Allied invasion fleet embarking the expeditionary forces left Pearl Harbor on 5 June 1944, the day before Operation Overlord in Europe was launched. The U.S. 2nd Marine Division, 4th Marine Division, and the Army's 27th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Holland Smith, defeated the 43rd Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito. The Battle of Bataan (7 January – 9 April 1942) represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II. In January 1942, forces of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy invaded Luzon along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. The commander-in-chief of all Filipino and American forces in the islands, General Douglas MacArthur, consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese invaders. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region. Despite a lack of supplies, Filipino and American forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward. As the combined Filipino and American forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific. The surrender at Bataan, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether, was the largest in American and Filipino military histories, and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry. Soon afterwards, Filipino and American prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March. The Battle of Manila, sometimes called the Mock Battle of Manila, was a land engagement which took place in Manila on August 13, 1898, at the end of the Spanish–American War, four months after the decisive victory by Commodore Dewey's Asiatic Squadron at the Battle of Manila Bay. The belligerents were Spanish forces led by Governor-General of the Philippines Fermín Jáudenes, and American forces led by United States Army Brigadier General Wesley Merritt and United States Navy Commodore George Dewey. American forces were supported by units of the Philippine Revolutionary Army, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The Battle of Piqua, also known as the Battle of Pekowee or Pekowi, was part of the western campaign during the American Revolutionary War. Led by General George Rogers Clark, over 1,000 soldiers (among them Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton) crossed the Ohio River near present-day Cincinnati and burned five Shawnee villages, including Old Chillicothe, along the Little Miami River. Peter Loramie's Store, a British trading post-located in what was later Fort Loramie, Ohio in Shelby County, Ohio-, was also burned by Clark's men. The Shawnee gradually withdrew during the first few days before finally engaging American forces 7 miles west of Springfield, Ohio on August 8, 1780. Joseph Rogers, a cousin of George Rogers Clark, had previously accompanied him to Kentucky and was later captured by the Shawnee near Maysville. Despite having been adopted by the tribe, he was killed during the battle while trying to join American forces. The Battle of Manilla (1574) was a battle in the Manila area mainly in the location of what is now Parañaque between Chinese pirates, led by Limahong and the Spanish colonial forces and their native allies. The battle occurred on November 29, 1574 when Limahong's fleet landed in the town of Parañaque and from there, began to assault the fortifications of Intramuros. Initially, the inhabitants where disorganized and Limahong's forces routed them. Furthermore, the Chinese killed the Master-of-Camp of the Spanish, Martin De Goiti. This caused them to delay their assault on Manila as Martin de Goiti's house was an obstacle in their march. However, upon the arrival of a certain Filipino hero called, Galo, resistance started to organize. Under Galo's command, they were able to resist China-born Limahong until Mexico-born Juan de Salcedo arrived from Ilocos with 300 Ilocano Warriors and Limahong was defeated and eventually forced to retreat. Thereafter Limahong abandoned his plans to invade Manila and instead, set up a temporary kingdom in Pangasinan.

**Question:** Which rock band chose its name by drawing it out of a hat, Switchfoot or Midnight Oil?
**Answer:** Midnight Oil

**Context:**
Midnight Oil is the debut album by Australian hard rock band Midnight Oil which was recorded in 1977 and released in November 1978 on the band's independent Powderworks label. It reached the top 50 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. The album was later distributed by CBS Records and issued as a CD. The LP has a blue cover, however, the CD has a black cover. Because of the blue cover, the former version is often referred to, by fans, as the "blue album" or "the Blue Meanie". The lead single, "Run By Night", became the band's first minor hit in Australia and appeared on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart Top 100. It also had a video clip. Red Sails in the Sunset is a rock album by Australian group Midnight Oil which was released in October 1984 under the Columbia Records label. It was recorded and produced in Tokyo, Japan and is significant for becoming their first No. 1 album in Australia – it also entered the United States "Billboard" 200. The cover image, by Japanese artist Tsunehisa Kimura, depicts Sydney Harbour after a hypothetical nuclear strike. Some of its tracks were performed live in January 1985 at a Sydney Harbour Goat Island concert to celebrate radio station Triple J's 10th birthday, which was simulcast on ABC Television and subsequently re-broadcast on their then-Tuesday night music program "Rock Arena". In 2004 the film footage later became part of a DVD album, "Best of Both Worlds". "Red Sails in the Sunset" contains the only Midnight Oil tracks with lead vocals provided by their drummer Rob Hirst, "When the Generals Talk" and "Kosciusko". The album spawned two singles, "When the Generals Talk" and "Best of Both Worlds" but neither appeared on the Australian singles chart. Robert George "Rob" Hirst (born 3 September 1955) is an Australian musician from Camden, New South Wales. He is a founding member of rock band Midnight Oil on drums, percussion and backing vocals (sometimes lead vocals) from the 1970s until the band's took a hiatus in 2002. He also wrote a book, "Willie's Bar & Grill", recounting the experiences on the tour Midnight Oil embarked on shortly after the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001. 20,000 Watt R.S.L. is a compilation album by Australian rock band Midnight Oil released in October 1997 on their own label Sprint Music. The word "Collection" appears on the front of the CD along the hinge in the same type face as the title and the name of the band and may have been intended as part of the album's title; however, it does not appear on the spine. The release has also been distributed inside a cardboard sleeve which adds "Midnight Oil: The Hits" to the album art, distinguishing it as a compilation album. The Power & The Passion ... a tribute to Midnight Oil is a 2001 tribute album featuring thirteen mostly Australian bands and artists, covering songs by the prominent Australian rock band Midnight Oil. Switchfoot is an American alternative rock band from San Diego, California.

Species Deceases is an extended play by Australian rock music group, Midnight Oil, which was released on 26 November 1985 under the CBS record label. "Species Deceases" debuted at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart for six weeks from December 1985 to January 1986. It was the first Australian single and/or EP to reach the number-one spot on its chart appearance and remains Midnight Oil's only No. 1 on the national singles chart. "Read About It" is the second single released by Australian rock band, Midnight Oil, from their 1982 studio album, "10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1". It was a favorite with the band and with fans, appearing at least once on every tour since its release and appearing at the WaveAid concert. Very few other Midnight Oil songs have appeared so often (only "Power and the Passion", "Beds Are Burning", "The Dead Heart", and "Say Your Prayers" are "known" to have been performed so often). Midnight Oil (also known informally as "The Oils" to fans) are an Australian rock band, who originally performed as Farm from 1972 with drummer Rob Hirst, bass guitarist Andrew James and keyboard player/lead guitarist Jim Moginie. While vocalist Peter Garrett was studying at Australian National University in Canberra, he answered an advertisement for a spot in Farm, and by 1975 the band was touring the east coast of Australia. By late 1976, Garrett moved to Sydney to complete his law degree, and Farm changed its name to Midnight Oil by drawing the name out of a hat. "Power and the Passion" was the second single by Midnight Oil from their 1982 album "10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1" (following "US Forces"). The song is one of the band's most famous, and it was performed on every Midnight Oil tour since the issue of "10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1" as well as at the WaveAid concert.

**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
Odds are a Canadian alternative rock band.

Drummers was a melodic hardcore band formed in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain at the end of 1997 by three teenagers who stood out from their other students due to their colourful hair dies and their taste in the california punk rock bands such as Bad Religion, Operation Ivy, NOFX, Lagwagon, The Descendents etc. Original members from other small local bands Dani Llamas (guitar and vocals), Pakomoto (Bass and vocals) and Rafa Camison (Drums) started playing together and composing their own music and after one year of sending demos around the country they got put as the opening act for Swedish Punk Rock band Randy on their Spanish tour. A tour that took the band through the whole country helping a lot of Spanish kids discover that there were actually Spanish bands capable of sounding as good as some of their favorite American bands. This lead immediately the band to sign to a young record label called Slide Chorus Records a young emerging record label from Madrid which would start releasing albums for other Spanish Punk Rock bands. This first release titled Proud To Be Nothing hit the streets at the end of 1999 and was presented on their first European tour which covered Spain, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands amongst Spanish punk rock legend[P.P.M.

Haitian rock, or rock kreyòl, started as rock n roll in Haiti in the early 1960s. It was played by rock bands called "yeye" bands. The name "yeye" derives from the Beatles lyrical verse, "yeah, yeah, yeah", which took off in the United States and was listened to by upper class Haitian families who had access to the radio. Young Haitians formed small electric guitar-based bands. These "yeye" rock bands were short-lived, as the addition of "compas" to their repertoires resulted in a sound was called mini-jazz, or "mini-djaz" in creole.

**Question:** Are York Minster and Brentwood Cathedral in the same country?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
York Minster Police is a small, specialised cathedral constabulary responsible for policing York Minster in York, United Kingdom. The York Minster astronomical clock was installed in the North Transept of York Minster in 1955. It was first conceived in 1944 and designed by R d'E Atkinson, chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. The clock is a memorial to the airmen operating from bases in Yorkshire, Durham, and Northumberland who were killed in action during World War II. Minster is an honorific title given to particular churches in England, most famously York Minster in York, Westminster in London and Southwell Minster in Southwell. The term "minster" is first found in royal foundation charters of the 7th century. Although it corresponds to the Latin "monasterium" or monastery, it then designated any settlement of clergy living a communal life and endowed by charter with the obligation of maintaining the daily office of prayer. Widespread in 10th-century Anglo-Saxon England, minsters declined in importance with the systematic introduction of parishes and parish churches from the 11th century onwards. It continued as a title of dignity in later medieval England, for instances where a cathedral, monastery, collegiate church or parish church had originated with an Anglo-Saxon foundation. Eventually a minster came to refer more generally to "any large or important church, especially a collegiate or cathedral church". In the 21st century, the Church of England has designated additional minsters by bestowing the status on existing parish churches. John Paul Burbridge was the Dean of Norwich in the latter part of the 20th century (1983-1995). Born on 21 May 1932, he was educated at The King's School, Canterbury and King's College, Cambridge, New College, Oxford, and Wells Theological College. After National Service with the Royal Artillery, he was ordained to a curacy at Eastbourne Parish Church in 1959. In 1962 he was appointed vicar choral and chamberlain at York Minster. He was appointed residentiary canon precentor at York Minster in 1966. In 1976 he was appointed Archdeacon of Richmond and canon residentiary at Ripon Cathedral, a post he held until his appointment as Dean of Norwich in 1983 (F.S.A). The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title "minster" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum. The Cathedral of St Mary and St Helen is the Roman Catholic cathedral in the English town of Brentwood, Essex. It is the seat of the Diocese of Brentwood. Lincoln Cathedral or the Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Lincoln, and sometimes St. Mary's Cathedral in Lincoln, England is the seat of the Anglican bishop. Building commenced in 1088 and continued in several phases throughout the medieval period. It was the tallest building in the world for 238 years (1311–1549), and the first building to hold that title after the Great Pyramid of Giza. The central spire collapsed in 1549 and was not rebuilt. The cathedral is the third largest in Britain (in floor area) after St Paul's and York Minster, being 484 by . It is highly regarded by architectural scholars; the eminent Victorian writer John Ruskin declared: "I have always held... that the cathedral of Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the British Isles and roughly speaking worth any two other cathedrals we have." The Old Palace in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England, is also known as the Minster Library and is in Dean's Park. It houses York Minster’s library and archives as well as the Collections Department and conservation studio. Its name is a new one and renders homage to the part of the building that used to be the chapel of the Archbishop of York, which was built in the 13th century. It was refurbished in 1810 and shortly thereafter became the home of the Minster library. Notable items held in the collection include cathedral records dating to back to 1150 and a copy of the 1631 Wicked Bible. It is a Grade I listed building. An extension was added in 1998. Grays Court is a Grade I listed ancient house in the middle of York, England, near York Minster, behind the Treasurer's House next to the city walls. Grays Court is possibly the oldest continuously occupied house in the United Kingdom. Dating back in part to 1080 and commissioned by the first Norman Archbishop of York to provide the official residence for the Treasurers of York Minster, the house has a significant history. The house was surrendered to the Crown on 26 May 1547 and the last of the mediaeval Treasurers, William Clyff, resigned. The first post-Reformation owner was Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset. He was given the house in 1547 by King Edward VI, the son of King Henry VIII. John Scott Whiteley (born 1950) is an English organist and composer. He has performed extensively around the world and since 1985 has undertaken an annual tour of the USA. He has performed in most major UK Cathedrals and concert halls, and was Assistant Organist and later Organist and Director of the Girls' choir at York Minster between 1975 and 2010. He is currently Organist Emeritus of York Minster.

Some salad bars also have additional food items such as cooked cold meats, (turkey, chicken, ham, or tuna), cooked beans (e.g., chick peas, garbanzo beans or kidney beans), boiled eggs, cottage cheese, cold pasta salads, tortilla chips, bread rolls, soup, and fresh cut fruit slices.

Wheat allergy is an allergy which typically presents itself as a food allergy, but can also be a contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response. Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy. Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.

Bean salad can be prepared as a pickled dish. It is common in some parts of the United States to refer to this sort of salad by the number of different beans it contains; e.g., "Three Bean Salad" or "Four Bean Salad."

**Question:** In what country did Irvine Gerald Sellar develop the second-tallest free-standing structure?
**Answer:** United Kingdom

**Context:**
Ostankino Tower (Russian: Останкинская телебашня , "Ostankinskaya telebashnya") is a television and radio tower in Moscow, Russia, owned by the Moscow branch of unitary enterprise Russian TV and Radio Broadcasting Network. Standing 540.1 m tall, Ostankino was designed by Nikolai Nikitin. It is currently the tallest free-standing structure in Europe and 11th tallest in the world. The tower was the first free-standing structure to exceed 500 m in height. Ostankino was built to mark the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. It is named after the Ostankino district of Moscow in which it is located. Wall boxes are a type of post box or letter box found in many countries including France, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Nations, Crown dependencies and Ireland. They differ from pillar boxes in that, instead of being a free-standing structure, they are generally set into a wall (hence the name) or supported on a free-standing pole, girder or other stable structure. In the UK, UK Dependent Territories, Colonies and former Colonies and in many former British Empire countries, wall boxes usually bear the initials of the reigning monarch at the time the box was made. The first UK wall boxes were erected in 1857 in Shrewsbury and Market Drayton. The Tallinn TV Tower ("Tallinna teletorn") is a free-standing structure with an observation deck, built to provide better telecommunication services for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics regatta event (see Sailing at the 1980 Summer Olympics). It is located near the suburb Pirita, six km north-east of the Tallinn city center. With its 314 m (1030.2 ft), the TV Tower is the tallest building in Tallinn. The tower was officially opened on 11 July 1980. The viewing platform at a height of 170 metres was open to the public until 26 November 2007, when it was closed for renovation. Having been repaired, the tower began receiving visitors again on 5 April 2012. The building is administered by the public company Levira (formerly "Estonian Broadcasting Transmission Center Ltd") and is a member of the World Federation of Great Towers. The Liaoning Broadcast and Television Tower (Chinese: 辽宁广播电视塔, Pinyin: liáoníng guǎngbō diànshì tǎ) is a tall free-standing structure used for communication. It was built in 1989 in Shenyang, China and is 305.5 m tall.

This tower is in World Federation of Great Towers. The Shard, also referred to as the Shard of Glass, Shard London Bridge and formerly London Bridge Tower, is a 95-storey skyscraper in Southwark, London, that forms part of the London Bridge Quarter development. Standing 309.7 m high, the Shard is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, the fourth-tallest building in Europe and the 96th-tallest building in the world. It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station. This list of tallest buildings in Toronto ranks skyscrapers in the Canadian city of Toronto, Ontario by height. The tallest structure in Toronto is the CN Tower, which rises 553 m . The CN Tower was the tallest free-standing structure on land from 1975 until 2007. However, it is not generally considered a high-rise building as it does not have successive floors that can be occupied. The tallest habitable building in the city is First Canadian Place, which rises 298 metres (978 ft) tall in Toronto's Financial District and was completed in 1975. It also stands as the tallest building in Canada. Q1 (an abbreviation of Queensland Number One) is a supertall skyscraper in Surfers Paradise, on the Gold Coast, Queensland. It lost its title as the world's tallest residential building to the 337-metre The Marina Torch in Dubai on 29 April 2011. It is now the sixth tallest residential tower in the world and is the tallest building in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere and the second-tallest free-standing structure in the Southern Hemisphere, behind the Sky Tower in Auckland, New Zealand. The Q1 officially opened in November 2005. The CN Tower (French: "Tour CN" ) is a 553.3 m concrete communications and observation tower in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976, and held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years from 1975–2007 and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 being overtaken by Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower, respectively. It is now the third tallest tower in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto's skyline, and a symbol of Canada, attracting more than two million international visitors annually. Irvine Gerald Sellar (9 September 1934 – 26 February 2017) was an English fashion retailer, turned property developer. He was the founder of the Sellar Property Group, and the developer of The Shard. A guy-wire, guy-line, or guy-rope, also known as simply a guy, is a tensioned cable designed to add stability to a free-standing structure. They are used commonly in ship masts, radio masts, wind turbines, utility poles, fire service extension ladders used in church raises and tents. A thin vertical mast supported by guy wires is called a guyed mast. Structures that support antennas are frequently of a lattice construction and are called "towers". One end of the guy is attached to the structure, and the other is anchored to the ground at some distance from the mast or tower base. The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compression and buckling strength of the structure, allows the structure to withstand lateral loads such as wind or the weight of cantilevered structures. They are installed radially, usually at equal angles about the structure, in trios and quads. As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120° angles. Structures with predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires, at a spot where the wires change direction.

**Question:** Which person is known for playing in punk bands, Keith Morris or Rome Ramirez?
**Answer:** Keith Morris

**Context:**
Reggae rock is a subgenre of reggae fusion and rock music that primarily uses the genres reggae, rock and ska. The term "reggae rock" has been used to categorize bands like The Police, Sublime, Sublime with Rome, Pepper, Slightly Stoopid, The Expendables, Iration, the Dirty Heads, Rebelution, 311 and, to some extent, heavier bands such as Fishbone and Bad Brains. The term "reggae metal" has been used to describe bands that combine reggae rock with heavy metal, such as Dub War, Skindred and Zeroscape. Reggae rock found its rise in popularity in the 1990s in Long Beach, California, with the band Sublime. The genre has lately found a boost in popularity with the 2010 song "Lay Me Down" by the Dirty Heads featuring Rome Ramirez from Sublime with Rome, which peaked at number 1 on both the US "Billboard" Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts. Keith Morris (born September 18, 1955) is an American singer and songwriter known for his role as frontman of the hardcore punk bands Black Flag, Circle Jerks, and Off! . Born and raised in Hermosa Beach, California, he formed Black Flag at the age of 21 with guitarist Greg Ginn and performed on the band's 1979 debut EP "Nervous Breakdown". Shortly after leaving Black Flag in 1979, he formed the Circle Jerks with guitarist Greg Hetson; the band released seven albums between 1980 and 1995 and are currently on hiatus. In 2009 Morris formed the supergroup Off! with guitarist Dimitri Coats, bassist Steven Shane McDonald, and drummer Mario Rubalcaba. Morris has also appeared as a guest vocalist on several albums by other artists. Midnight Snack Break at the Poodle Factory is the only album by Punk jazz supergroup Midget Handjob, formed by past Black Flag and Circle Jerks singer Keith Morris. The album combines spoken word with punk jazz. It was released on Epitaph Records on September 26, 2000. Roman René Ramírez (born June 11, 1988 in Fremont, California), better known as Rome Ramirez or simply Rome, is an American singer and guitarist best known for playing with Eric Wilson from Sublime and Josh Freese from The Vandals in the band Sublime with Rome. The lineup initially featured original Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh before his departure in 2011. Despite participation by Gaugh and Wilson, the family of deceased Sublime member Bradley Nowell legally challenged the use of the Sublime name by the surviving members. Nowell had actually registered the trademark "Sublime" under his own name prior to his death, and had sole ownership at the time of his death. The lineup featuring Rome, Wilson and Bud Gaugh released their debut album "Yours Truly" on July 12, 2011. Yours Truly is the debut album by rock group Sublime with Rome, which was released on July 12, 2011. It is the first album since the original Sublime disbanded in 1996, due to lead singer and guitarist Bradley Nowell's death. According to the liner notes, the album is dedicated to him. After the break up, its surviving members Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh reformed Sublime in 2009 almost by accident, with Rome Ramirez filling in for Nowell. However, the group were unable to use the name Sublime for legal reasons, which resulted in the birth of Sublime with Rome. After embarking on their first US tour in 2010, Sublime with Rome signed with the record label Fueled by Ramen and went to work on its first full-length studio album. Guitarist Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers, who co-produced Sublime's eponymous final album, produced it. Circle Jerks (stylized as Ciʀcle Jʀᴋs) were an American hardcore punk band, formed in 1979 in Los Angeles, California. The group was founded by former Black Flag vocalist Keith Morris and Redd Kross guitarist Greg Hetson. They were among the preeminent hardcore punk bands of the LA scene in the late 1970s. The Circle Jerks were an American punk rock band whose most recent lineup consisted of vocalist Keith Morris, guitarist Greg Hetson, bassist Zander Schloss, and drummer Kevin Fitzgerald. The band was formed in Southern California in 1979, and originally comprised Morris on vocals, Hetson on guitar, Roger Rogerson on bass and Lucky Lehrer on drums. Street punk (alternatively spelled streetpunk) is a working class-based genre of punk rock which took shape in the early 1980s, partly as a rebellion against the perceived artistic pretensions of the first wave of British punk. Street punk emerged from the style of early punk bands such as Sham 69 and Cockney Rejects, and the Oi! style bands that followed them such as Blitz, The Business and Angelic Upstarts. A key band in defining the aesthetic was The Exploited, a punk band that don't fit the Oi category, but share several characteristic with those bands. However, street punk continued beyond the confines of the original Oi! form with bands such as GBH, Chaos UK, Discharge, The Anti-Nowhere League and Oxymoron. Street punks generally have a much more ostentatious and flamboyant appearance than the working class or skinhead image cultivated by many Oi! groups. Street punks commonly sported multi-coloured hair, mohawks, tattoos, heavily studded vests and leather jackets, and clothing, especially plaids, adorned with political slogans, patches, and/or the names of punk bands. Brisbane punk rock had its main impact between 1975 and 1984 as part of the overall punk rock scene in Australia. According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, the Queensland capital provided "some of the most anarchistic bands" of that era whilst it was "arguably the most conservative city" in the country. The development of the local punk movement differed from other cities because of its relative geographic isolation from other similar trends. The Brisbane scene also received a greater scrutiny by local police where early punk bands formed as "an obvious backlash to an oppressed society". This generated antagonistic and individualistic groups or "snot" driven punk bands. Black Flag is an American hardcore punk band formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California by Greg Ginn, the band's guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole constant member. During Black Flag's ten-year existence, the band went through sixteen distinct lineups involving seventeen different musicians. Aside from Ginn, the longest-lasting members were singer Henry Rollins (5 years), bassist Chuck Dukowski (4½ years), and drummer Roberto "Robo" Valverde (3 years). The 1983–1985 lineup of Ginn, Rollins, bassist Kira Roessler, and drummer Bill Stevenson recording four albums and three EPs together in a sixteen-month period. After breaking up in 1986 and briefly reuniting in 2003, Black Flag announced another reunion in January 2013. Two versions of Black Flag are currently touring; the Ginn-fronted band known as "Black Flag", and one featuring founding vocalist Keith Morris known simply as "Flag".

**Question:** Who was the writer of These Boots Are Made for Walkin' and who died in 2007?
**Answer:** Barton Lee Hazlewood

**Context:**
Nancy Sandra Sinatra (born June 8, 1940) is an American singer and actress. She is the elder daughter of Frank Sinatra and Nancy (Barbato) Sinatra, and is widely known for her 1966 signature hit "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'". Kon Kan is a Canadian synthpop project conceived and formed in 1988 by Barry Harris in Toronto, Ontario. Kon Kan were awarded a 1990 Juno for the song "I Beg Your Pardon" and nominated for a 1991 Juno Award for the single "Puss N' Boots/These Boots Are Made for Walkin'". Abdul Wali was an Afghan man who died in US custody on June 21, 2003 at the age of 28. At the time of his death, he had been held for three days at the US base 10 miles south of Asadabad, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on suspicion of involvement in a rocket attack on the same base. The cause of his death was at first reported to be a heart attack, but this came into question when three members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division came forward to testify that CIA contractor David Passaro assaulted Wali. Passaro, a former U.S. Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing grievous injuries including a fractured pelvis. Prosecutors would charge that Passaro ordered soldiers not to allow Wali to sleep, limited his access to food and water and subjected him to two consecutive nights of interrogation and beatings.

Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a series of novels beginning in 1908 with "Anne of Green Gables". The book was an immediate success. The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. Anne Shirley is a fictional character introduced in the 1908 novel "Anne of Green Gables" by Lucy Maud Montgomery. Montgomery wrote in her journal that the idea for Anne's story came from relatives who, planning to adopt an orphaned boy, received a girl instead. Anne Shirley's appearance was inspired by a photograph which Montgomery clipped from the Metropolitan Magazine and kept, unaware of the model's identity as the 1900s Gibson Girl Evelyn Nesbit.

**Question:** when the Marlins are the home team, games are played at this park which was LEED certified as the greenest MLB park in what year?
**Answer:** 2012

**Context:**
The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in the U.S. state of Florida. The Marlins became members of MLB as an expansion team in the 1993 season. Through 2010, they have played 2,848 games, winning 1,363 and losing 1,485 for a winning percentage of .478. This list documents the superlative records and accomplishments of team members during their tenures as Marlins in MLB's National League East. The 2009 SEC Championship Game was played on December 5, 2009, in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, to determine the 2009 football champion of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The game featured the Florida Gators and the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Crimson Tide was the designated "home team"; this home team, chosen on an alternating basis, was 2–4 in SEC Championship Games. The winner was all but assured to go on to play for a National Championship, in a likely matchup with the Texas Longhorns provided Texas won in the Big 12 Championship Game versus the north division champion Nebraska Cornhuskers. Entering the 2009 contest, the SEC East was 11–6 in SEC Championship games, with the Florida Gators accounting for seven of the eleven victories. Before the 2009 game, Alabama represented the SEC West six times in the conference championship game, compiling a 2–4 record, and had faced the Gators in all six of their previous SEC Championship game appearances. This was the first and so far the only time any conference championship game had featured two undefeated teams and was also the first time an AP Poll No. 1 played a No. 2 outside of the BCS Championship Game since the top-ranked Ohio State beat the second-ranked Michigan during the 2006 regular season. The stadium is designed in a neomodern form of baseball architecture. Marlins Park was also LEED certified as the greenest MLB park in 2012. The building is the sixth MLB stadium to have a retractable roof. With a seating capacity of 37,442, it is the third-smallest stadium in Major League Baseball by official capacity, and the smallest by actual capacity.

It was televised nationally by Fox. The game was the first since 2002 whose outcome did not determine home-field advantage for the World Series; instead, the team with the better regular-season record will have home-field advantage. The Marlins were announced as the hosts on February 10, 2015, by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred; the game was the Marlins' first time hosting, leaving the Tampa Bay Rays as the only MLB franchise not to have hosted an All-Star game. The 2010 NHL Winter Classic (known via corporate sponsorship as the 2010 NHL Winter Classic presented by Bridgestone) was an outdoor regular season National Hockey League (NHL) game played on January 1, 2010, at Fenway Park in Boston.

In baseball, a no-hitter (also known as a no-hit game and colloquially as a no-no) is a game in which a team was not able to record a single hit. Major League Baseball (MLB) officially defines a no-hitter as a completed game in which a team that batted in at least nine innings recorded no hits. A pitcher who prevents the opposing team from achieving a hit is said to have "thrown a no-hitter". This is a rare accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff: only 296 have been thrown in Major League Baseball history since 1876, an average of about two per year. In most cases in MLB, no-hitters are recorded by a single pitcher who throws a complete game; one thrown by two or more pitchers is a combined no-hitter. The most recent no-hitter by a single pitcher was thrown on June 3, 2017 by Edinson Vólquez of the Miami Marlins against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Miami's Marlins Park. The most recent combined no-hitter was thrown by Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman, Ken Giles, and Jonathan Papelbon of the Philadelphia Phillies against the Atlanta Braves on September 1, 2014. The Citrus Series is the name given to the interleague series between the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball. The Marlins broke into the league in as the "Florida Marlins", while the Rays had their first season in as the "Tampa Bay Devil Rays".

The 1998 Florida Marlins season started off with the team trying to repeat as World Series Champions, having won the title in 1997. Their manager was Jim Leyland. They played home games at Pro Player Stadium. They finished with a record of 54–108, dead last in the NL East. The team is notable for having arguably the biggest fire sale in sports history, auctioning off nearly all of their most notable players. The 1998 Marlins were the first defending World Series champions to finish last in their division. After winning on opening day against the Chicago Cubs, the Marlins would lose 11 straight, the most consecutive losses by a reigning champion. The Marlins would finish 0-9 against 3 teams: Cincinnati, San Francisco, and Milwaukee. The 1998 Marlins are the last team in baseball history to finish winless against 3 separate opponents.

**Question:** What is the proper name for the steroid used by the retired British track sprinter who is one of the fastest European sprinters in the history of athletics?
**Answer:** Tetrahydrogestrinone

**Context:**
Richard Kilty (born 2 September 1989) is a British track and field sprinter who competes in the 60 metres, 100 metres and 200 metres. His personal bests for the events are 6.49 seconds, 10.01 seconds and 20.34 seconds, respectively. Coached for several years by 1992 Olympic 100 m champion Linford Christie, Kilty switched to Rana Reider in late 2013, when the American coach was recruited by UK Athletics. He is the 2014 World, and 2015 and 2017 European Indoor 60m champion. He also gained numerous British national sprint titles, including UK junior 100m champion and two-time English Schools national 100 metres champion, during his years at Northfield School and Sports College. On the British club-level, he represents Gateshead Harriers, which is the major track club in his native northeast England. Somnus is a retired British champion Thoroughbred racehorse. One of the best European two-year-olds in 2002, he developed into a leading sprinter the following year when he won the Group One Haydock Sprint Cup. As a four-year-old he won two more Group One races in France- the Prix Maurice de Gheest (2004) and the Prix de la Forêt- and was named European Champion Sprinter at the Cartier Racing Awards. He continued racing until being retired in 2008 at the age of eight, having won ten of his forty-three races. Unlike many sprinters, Somnus was not a pure "speed horse" and ran only once, unsuccessfully, at five furlongs: all his victories came over six or seven furlongs. Edward W. "Dad" Moulton (1849 – July 19, 1922) was an American sprinter, athletic trainer, and coach. He was a professional sprinter who won more than 300 races and was regarded as the American sprinting champion from 1872 to 1878. Moulton later worked as a trainer of sprinters, wrestlers, boxers, and bicyclists. He trained many well-known track and field athletes from the 1880s through the 1910s, including the original "world's fastest human," Al Tharnish, and Olympic medalists Alvin Kraenzlein (four gold medals in 1900), Charlie Paddock (two gold medals and one silver in 1920), Morris Kirksey (one gold and one silver in 1920), George Horine (bronze medal in 1912), and Feg Murray (bronze medal in 1920). Allan Wipper Wells (born 3 May 1952) is a former British track and field sprinter who became the 100 metres Olympic champion at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Within a fortnight of that, he also took on and beat America's best sprinters at an invitational meeting in Koblenz. In 1981, Wells was both the IAAF Golden Sprints and IAAF World Cup gold medallist. He is also a three-time European Cup gold medallist among many other sprint successes. Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), often referred to by its nickname The Clear, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) which was never marketed. It was developed by Patrick Arnold and was used by a number of high-profile athletes such as Marion Jones and Dwain Chambers. Dwain Anthony Chambers (born 5 April 1978) is a retired British track sprinter. He has won international medals at World and European level and is one of the fastest European sprinters in the history of athletics. His primary event is the 100 metres, in which he has the fourth fastest time by a British sprinter. He is the European record holder for the 60 metres and 4×100 metres relay events with 6.42 seconds and 37.73 s respectively. He received a two-year athletics ban in 2003 after testing positive for THG, a banned performance-enhancing drug. Jana Kolukanova (born August 4, 1981) is a retired Estonian swimmer, who specialized in sprint freestyle events. She is a two-time Olympian, multiple-times champion of Estonia and one of the top European sprinters of her generation. Stephen James Backley, OBE (born 12 February 1969) is a retired British track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw. He formerly held the world record, and his 91.46 m throw from 1992 is the British record. During his career, he was a firm fixture in the British national athletics team. He won four gold medals at the European Championships, three Commonwealth Games gold medals, two silvers and a bronze at the Olympic Games, and two silvers at the World Championships. Māsarjawaih (Arabic: ماسرجويه‎ ‎ ) was one of the earliest Jewish physicians of Persian origin, and the earliest translator from the Syriac; he lived in Basra about 683 (Anno Hegirae 64). His name, distorted, has been transmitted in European sources; it has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Neuda (in "Orient, Lit." vi. 132) compares the name ""Masarjawaih"" with the Hebrew proper name ""Mesharsheya""; but the ending ""-waih"" points to a Persian origin. The form ""Masarjis"" has been compared with the Christian proper name ""Mar Serjis""; but it is not known that Masarjis embraced either Christianity or Islam. In the philosophy of language a proper name, for example the names of persons or places, is a name which is ordinarily taken to uniquely identify its referent in the world. As such it presents particular challenges for theories of meaning and it has become a central problem in analytical philosophy. The common sense view was originally formulated by John Stuart Mill in "A System of Logic" where he defines it as "a word that answers the purpose of showing what thing it is that we are talking about but not of telling anything about it". This view was criticized when philosophers applied principles of formal logic to linguistic propositions. Gottlob Frege pointed out that proper names may apply to imaginary and inexistent entities without becoming meaningless, and he showed that sometimes more than one proper name may identify the same entity without having the same "sense", so that the phrase "Homer believed the morning star was the evening star" could be meaningful and not tautological in spite of the fact that the morning star and the evening star identifies the same referent. This example became known as Frege's Puzzle and is a central issue in the theory of proper names.

**Question:** Where does the descendant of the Red Setter originate? 
**Answer:** Scotland

**Context:**
Subfunctionalization was proposed by Stoltzfus (1999) and Force et al. (1999) as one of the possible outcomes of functional divergence that occurs after a gene duplication event, in which pairs of genes that originate from duplication, or paralogs, take on separate functions. Subfunctionalization is a neutral mutation process; meaning that no new adaptations are formed. During the process of gene duplication paralogs simply undergo a division of labor by retaining different parts (subfunctions) of their original ancestral function. This partitioning event occurs because of segmental gene silencing leading to the formation of paralogs that are no longer duplicates, because each gene only retains a single function. It is important to note that the ancestral gene was capable of performing both functions and the descendant duplicate genes can now only perform one of the original ancestral functions. The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland. The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie. It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters. Mulcahy is a surname and Clan of Irish Gaelic origin. The anglicized form of "Ó Maolchathaigh" which in Gaelic means 'a descendant of a devotee of Cathach', a personal name meaning Warlike. The name is thought to originate in County Tipperary, However the earliest mention of the family appears in the Annals of Inisfallen in 1317 AD and subsequent references in and around the Churches of County Kerry in the 15th century. The Irish Setter (Irish: "sotar rua" , literally "red setter") is a setter, a breed of gundog, and family dog. The term "Irish Setter" is commonly used to encompass the show-bred dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as well as the field-bred Red Setter recognised by the Field Dog Stud Book. Kanitkar is a surname used by Konkanastha Chitapavan sub-caste of Brahmins in India. Kanitkars, like most other Konkanastha Chitpavan Brahmins, originate in the Konkan strip on the western seacoast of India - about 300-500 kilometers south of Mumbai. Kanitkars (other names: Satkar) were from original five towns and 23 descendant families, spread to 110 towns by 1988. Kanitkars belong to Kaushik Gotra, and consider Shri Vyadeshwar at Guhaghar, Maharashtra, India as their primary "family god" [Kul Daivat]. The Reverend Noble Huston (died 1944), was the minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch, County Down and a breeder of dogs, credited with saving the Irish Red and White Setter from extinction in the early the twentieth century. According to Anna Redlich in “The Dogs of Ireland” (Dundalgan Press 1949), he " mated his half red and half red and white bitch Gyp to Johnnie, and later on to Glen of Rossmore ... Thus in due time and by judicious selection , he managed to build up a kennel of Red and White Setters..." James Andrew Hanna (c. 1947 – 1 April 1974), also known as Red Setter, was a senior member of the Northern Irish loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) until he was shot dead by fellow members, for being an alleged informer. Journalists Joe Tiernan and Kevin Myers described him as having been the senior military leader of the UVF. Tiernan also suggested that he was part of a UVF unit that planted car bombs in Dublin in December 1972 and January 1973 which left three people dead and 145 injured. Tiernan claimed that Hanna was controlled by four British Army Intelligence Corps officers who frequently visited his home in Lisburn. The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog. It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton. The Irish Red and White Setter () is a breed of dog, more specifically a setter. As with all the setters and the Pointer, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada. It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter and its other setter cousins, the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog. Coity Mountain (also spelled "Coety Mountain", Welsh: "Mynydd Coety") is a flat-topped mountain in the South Wales Valleys, between Blaenavon and Abertillery. The highest points of both Torfaen and Blaenau Gwent unitary authorities are at the summit of Coity Mountain. The summit is also known as Twyn Ffynhonnau Goerion. Some 2 km to the southeast lies a major subsidiary top of the hill, Mynydd Varteg Fawr (549m) at the southeastern end of whose broad ridge is a trig point at 544m. A few hundred metres to the southeast of this summit is a memorial known as the "Dog Stone" which commemorates "Carlo the Red Setter", a dog shot accidentally by his master while hunting on the 12 August 1864.

The song was composed by Ghanaian musician Guy Warren in 1956 under the original title "An African's Prayer (Eyi Wala Dong)". Berthold Heinrich Kämpfert, (16 October 1923 – 21 June 1980), better known as Bert Kaempfert, was a German orchestra leader, music producer, and songwriter.

Best known for his work with pop musicians Bert Kaempfert, James Last and Freddy Quinn, Geisler developed the distinctive "Knack-Bass" percussive bass sound that helped popularize the Bert Kaempfert Orchestra. He later released numerous records under his own name. "Strangers in the Night" is a song credited to Bert Kaempfert with English lyrics by Charles Singleton and Eddie Snyder. Kaempfert originally used it under the title "Beddy Bye" as part of the instrumental score for the movie "A Man Could Get Killed." The song was made famous in 1966 by Frank Sinatra, although it was initially given to Melina Mercouri, who thought that a man's vocals would suit more to the melody and therefore declined to sing it. "A Swingin' Safari" is an instrumental composed by Bert Kaempfert (using his alias, Bernd Bertie) in 1962. It was recorded by Kaempfert on Polydor Records and released in the United States on Decca Records, but failed to chart. That same year, Billy Vaughn recorded it, and his cover reached number 13 on the "Billboard" charts that summer. Herbert "Herb" Rehbein (15 April 1922 – 28 July 1979) was a German songwriter, composer and arranger of light orchestral music. Together with his friend and collaborator Bert Kaempfert, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1993. Harald Ende (born February 15, 1929, Hamburg, Germany) is a German saxophone, flute and accordion player who was active in the Hamburg music scene from the 1950s to the 1990s. He attended the local music school and was trained as a classical clarinetist. However, upon graduating, he soon found that in order to get steady work, he had to play in a more popular context. In 1958, he joined the NDR (Norddeutscher Rundfunk, or North German Radio) big band. He also worked as a studio musician for many popular German recording acts like Bert Kaempfert. In 1968, he joined the James Last Orchestra, for which he had to learn how to play the flute; James Last himself taught Ende how to play the instrument. A big band musician enamoured with the work of Buddy Rich and Count Basie, Ende recorded and toured with Last until the end of 1979, after which he devoted most of his career to his work with the NDR big band, often backing up well-known jazz stars like Joe Pass and Chet Baker. One popular sideline act was his accordion duo with fellow Last and Kaempfert bandmate Günter Platzek, known as The Pop Kids. Now retired, Ende took part in the 80th anniversary celebration of the birth of Bert Kaempfert in 2003. "Wonderland by Night" (German title ""Wunderland bei Nacht"") is a popular song by Bert Kaempfert that was a "Billboard" number one hit for three weeks, starting January 9, 1961. The song was written by Klaus-Günter Neumann with English lyrics by Lincoln Chase. It was Kaempfert's first hit with his orchestra. The song featured Charly Tabor on trumpet. The original version of "Wonderland by Night" also crossed over to the R&B chart where it peaked at number five. Another cover, recorded and released by Louis Prima, also charted in the same year, reaching #15 on the Billboard charts. Anita Bryant's version, which included orchestrations by Lew Douglas, reached #18 on the US Pop Chart. Engelbert Humperdinck also recorded a vocal version of the song in his 1968 album "A Man Without Love." Manfred Moch was a German trumpet player. He made a name for himself in the 1960s as the featured solo trumpet player for the Bert Kaempfert orchestra, contributing memorable and melodic solos to many of Kaempfert’s hits; such songs included “Bye Bye Blues”, “Strangers In The Night”, “L-O-V-E” and “Sweet Maria”. His association with Kaempfert ended in 1968 over a pay dispute, but by the late 1970s he was again playing sessions and concerts with Kaempfert, although not as a soloist. Moch was also a long-time member of the James Last Orchestra during the 1960s and 1970s, and continued to play for Last as a session musician after leaving the touring band. In addition, Moch was a member of the NDR (Nordeutscher Rundfunk, or North German Radio) Big Band from the 1960s until the 1990s. He was also active as a session player in Hamburg, playing for many other popular German recording artists. During the late 1960s, Moch recorded some trumpet duet albums with fellow Last/Kaempfert bandmate Heinz Habermann, which were released on the Decca label under the name The Tattoos. "Danke Schoen" is a 1962 song first recorded by Bert Kaempfert. It gained its fame in 1963 when American singer Wayne Newton recorded his version of it. It regained fame when it was featured in the 1986 American comedy film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off", lip synced by the main character, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick). The music was composed by Bert Kaempfert, with the German lyrics written by Kurt Schwabach and the English lyrics by Milt Gabler. The melody was originally released without lyrics under the title "Candlelight Cafe".

**Question:** Dean O'Banion was the main rival of which mobster, known as Scarface?
**Answer:** Alphonse Gabriel Capone

**Context:**
The Samarkand clan (alternatively Samarqand) is an Uzbek clan led by Ismoil Jurabekov. The clan is one of two major clans in Uzbekistan; the other, its main rival, is the Tashkent clan. To a lesser extent, the Ferghana clan is also a rival. Former Uzbek President Islam Karimov and current President Shavkat Mirziyoyev come from the Samarkand clan. Alphonse Gabriel Capone ( ; ] ; January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the nickname Scarface, was an American mobster, crime boss and businessman who attained fame during the Prohibition era as the co-founder and boss of the Chicago Outfit. His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old. "I Seen a Man Die", also known as "I Never Seen a Man Cry", is the second single released from Scarface's third album, "The Diary". Produced by N.O. Joe, Mike Dean and Scarface himself, "I Seen a Man Die" became a top 40 hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100, the first of two that Scarface had in his career. It peaked at 37 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is a tale of a young male released from prison after seven years looking for a better life only to get caught up on the crime side again and robbed by his enemies only to die in the hospital while feeling regrets. The song also has a music video released which mirrors Scarface's lyrics. Angelo "Bloody Angelo" Genna (February 3, 1898 – May 26, 1925) was a Chicago bootlegger and organized crime leader during the Prohibition era. The leader of his own Sicilian crime family, he was best known for his war with the North Side Gang leader, Charles Dean O'Banion. Genna masterminded the assassination of O'Banion in November 1924. Gold (stylised as GOLD) is a British classic comedy channel from the UKTV network, broadcasting to the United Kingdom and Ireland. It launched on 1 November 1992 as UK Gold, before, in 2008, it was split into current flagship channel Gold and miscellaneous channel, Watch, with comedy based programming now airing on Gold, non-crime drama and entertainment programming airing on Watch, and quiz shows and more high-brow comedy airing on Dave. The channel is currently available as subscription-only on Sky, Virgin Media, TalkTalk TV, BT TV, and TVPlayer (When subscribed to TVPlayer Plus). It shows repeats of classic programming from the BBC and other broadcasters. The channel's main rival is the ITV plc owned ITV3, which mainly airs the archive ITV programmes, and has a higher audience share than Gold. Another rival is More4 which also has a higher audience share than Gold. This is because they are free-to-air channels whereas Gold is a pay TV channel. On 1st December 2015 - 4th January 2016, Gold was temporarily rebranded as Christmas Gold. This was repeated again from 12 November 2016 to 4 January 2017. A rivalry is the opposition between two competing parties (rivals). Someone's main rival is called an archrival. The words rivalry, rival and arch rival may also refer to: Charles Dean O'Banion (July 8, 1892 – November 10, 1924) was an American mobster who was the main rival of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone during the brutal Chicago bootlegging wars of the 1920s. The newspapers of his day made him better known as Dion O'Banion, although he never went by that first name. He led the North Side Gang until 1924, when he was murdered, reportedly by Frankie Yale, John Scalise and Albert Anselmi. Hits is a compilation album series that ran in the United Kingdom for over twenty years from 1984 until 2006. It was compiled as a joint venture, variously between the compilation arms of the Sony BMG and Warner Music groups to rival the "Now That's What I Call Music" series that had launched a year earlier in 1983, compiled by rival companies EMI and Virgin. Initially, the "Hits" brand was arguably as popular as its main rival, with volume one through to volume eight all achieving at least a platinum BPI award, with several of the early albums going multi-platinum. The standard release rate of "The Hits Album" was two volumes per year compared with three volumes of the "Now" albums. Scarface (also known as Scarface: The Shame of the Nation and The Shame of a Nation) is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film starring Paul Muni as Antonio "Tony" Camonte. It was produced by Howard Hughes and Howard Hawks and directed by Hawks. The story is based on Armitage Trail's 1929 novel of the same name, which is loosely based on the rise and fall of Al Capone. The film features Ann Dvorak as Camonte's sister, and also stars Karen Morley, Osgood Perkins, and Boris Karloff. The plot centers on gang warfare and police intervention when rival gangs fight over control of Chicago. A version of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre is also depicted. Vincent Drucci, also known as "The Schemer" (born Vincenzo D'Ambrosio; 1898 – April 4, 1927), was an Sicilian-American mobster during Chicago's Prohibition era who was a member of the North Side Gang, Al Capone's best known rivals. A friend of Dean O'Banion, Drucci succeeded him by becoming co-leader. He is the only US organized crime boss to have been killed by a policeman.

**Question:** OU812 was the second album to feature a vocalist that also played what instrument in "Finish What Ya Started"?
**Answer:** rhythm guitar

**Context:**
Tu Ángel de la Guarda ("Your guardian angel") is Gloria Trevi's second album, and it contained one of her signature songs and her most widely known hit, "Pelo Suelto". It also contained other hit songs such as "Tu angel de la guarda", "Ya no", "Virgen de las virgenes", and "Hoy me ire de casa". This album was very controversial different from other artists' albums such as Lucero. "Virgen de las virgenes" mocked girls who said they were virgins but had actually lost their virginity, and "¡Ya no!" went against the machismo movement of México. Following the release of the album, Gloria was working hard in promoting radio, television and print media. Trevi first traveled abroad visiting American Union countries, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and received a Gold and Platinum for high sales achieved. OU812 (pronounced "Oh You Ate One Too") is the eighth studio album by American hard rock band Van Halen, released in 1988, and the second to feature vocalist Sammy Hagar. Van Halen started work on the album in September 1987 and completed it in April 1988, just one month before its release. "Wizard in Black" is the second track on doom metal band Electric Wizard's second album, Come My Fanatics.... On the original version of the CD, the beginning of the song features a sample from the 1974 zombie film "Let Sleeping Corpses Lie" (aka "The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue"), in which the Inspector (a character in the film) tells George (one of the teenage protagonists), "You're all the same, the lot of you, with your long hair and faggot clothes. Drugs, sex…every sort of filth. And ya hate the police, don't ya?" This is followed by George's reply, "You make it easy." "Finish What Ya Started" is a song by Van Halen taken from their 1988 album "OU812". Despite the album being seemingly complete, Eddie Van Halen came up with the riff at 2 in the morning and went down to his then-neighbor Sammy Hagar to show it. Hagar let Eddie in, and the two played guitars in his balcony until they had a completed song. Once Eddie left, Hagar decided to write the lyrics despite being late at night. The theme wound up being unfulfilled sex, summed up by Hagar as "blue balls. In the song, Eddie Van Halen recorded his guitar part on a Fender Stratocaster plugged direct into the studio mixing console. The song is one of only two Van Halen tracks featuring Sammy Hagar playing a rhythm guitar part, which he played on a Gibson acoustic. The OU812 Tour was a concert tour by hard rock band Van Halen. It was the second tour to include dates in Japan, and was the second with Sammy Hagar as vocalist (who had settled into the role more by this point). It followed the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988, which had formed the first part of the promotion for the "OU812" album. The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers (1938- 1966) were an early bluegrass band which included such notable "first generation" bluegrass musicians as Ezra Cline, Bobby Osborne, Paul Williams, Melvin Goins, Charlie Cline, Curly Ray Cline, Larry Richardson and for a short time Jimmy Martin. The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named "Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers". The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia. During World War II, Ned was killed in action. When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis. Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca. It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass. This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none. Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry). Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award. In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play. (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage). The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of "Pain in my Heart" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening. John (Boss) Murphy (1875–1955) from The Leap, Churchtown, Co. Cork was a former farmer by profession, but possessed a keen interest in fiddle playing, and was renowned locally for his ability on the instrument. His father, William Murphy (1829–1911), was both a fiddle player and maker, indeed John was the proud owner of an instrument that had been made by his father. John’s father was his first fiddle teacher. His siblings, a brother and three sisters, also played the instrument but their interest in music waned as they reached adulthood and they did not continue to play. John’s musical literacy was also gained primarily from his father, who had learnt to read music at a hedge school at Ballygrace in the locality taught by a Thomas Croke. The same Thomas Croke, many years later, stayed for long periods of time in the Murphy household and would undoubtedly also have taught the young John directly. If You Only Knew is the second album by American R&B singer Gina Thompson. It was scheduled to be released through Elektra Records/East West Records on September 21, 1999, however it was shelved due to the failure and lack of commercial success for her lead singles, "Ya Di Ya" (#38 U.S. R&B) and "Caught Up". The album, however, was released by Elektra Records for a limited time, due to the lukewarm success of "Ya Di Ya". The Lord Wilton Guarnerius, sometimes called the ex-Yehudi Menuhin, is an antique and valuable violin fabricated by Italian luthier, Giuseppe Antonio Guarneri (1698–1744), usually called Guarneri del Gesù. The Wilton was crafted in 1742 in the city of Cremona. It was named after Seymour Egerton, 4th Earl of Wilton, a musician, associate of Arthur Sullivan, and 19th century owner of the instrument. It was owned and played by the celebrated violinist Yehudi Menuhin from 1978 to 1999. After Menuhin's death in 1999, the instrument was sold for $US6 million to the collector David L. Fulton, the highest price paid for a violin to that date. As of 2015, the instrument remains in Fulton's possession. Zlatko Balokovic also played the instrument from 1952 to 1961. Emel Mathlouthi (Arabic: آمال المثلوثي) (born January 11, 1982) is a Tunisian singer-songwriter best known for her protest songs "Ya Tounes Ya Meskina" ("Poor Tunisia") and "Kelmti Horra" ("My Word is Free"), which became anthems for the Tunisian revolution. Her first studio album, also titled "Kelmti Horra", was released worldwide by Harmonia Mundi in 2012 to critical acclaim. Her second album, "Ensen, was released by Partisan Records in 2017, also to comsiderable acclaim.

**Question:** What nationality was the Jaguar R2 driver, Eddie Irvine?
**Answer:** British racing driver

**Context:**
Edmund Irvine Jr. (born 10 November 1965) is a retired British racing driver from Northern Ireland. He was a Formula One driver between 1993 and 2002, and runner-up in the 1999 World Drivers' Championship, driving for Scuderia Ferrari. The Jaguar R3 is a Formula One racing car with which Jaguar Racing competed in the 2002 Formula One season. The car was launched on January 4, 2002. It was driven by Eddie Irvine and Pedro de la Rosa, both retained from 2001. The 2001 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the LIX Grand Prix de Monaco) was a Formula One motor race held at the Circuit de Monaco on 27 May 2001. It was the seventh race of the 2001 Formula One season. The 78-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher driving for the Ferrari team. Rubens Barrichello finished second in the other Ferrari with Eddie Irvine third for the Jaguar team. Schumacher's win was his fourth of season, and Irvine's third place was the first podium position for the Jaguar team. The 1997 Argentine Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Autódromo Oscar Alfredo Gálvez in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 13 April 1997. It was the third race of the 1997 Formula One season and the 600th World Championship event. The 72-lap race was won by Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve after he started from pole position. Eddie Irvine finished second for the Ferrari team and Jordan driver Ralf Schumacher came in third. The Jordan 194 was a Formula One car for the 1994 season. The number 14 seat was taken by Rubens Barrichello and the number 15 seat was taken by Eddie Irvine. Kelvin Burt was named as test driver, but his mileage in the car was limited. The engine was a Hart 1035 3.5 V10, a developed version of the engine which had proved promising in 1993. The team's main sponsor was Sasol, with additional financial support coming from Arisco, the Irish government and other smaller sponsors. With driver aids such as traction control and active suspension banned for the 1994 season, the car used a conventional semi-automatic gearbox and pushrod double wishbone suspension.

In sports, the terms Cinderella, "Cinderella story", and Cinderella team are used to refer to situations in which competitors achieve far greater success than would reasonably have been expected. Cinderella stories tend to gain much media and fan attention as they move closer to the championship game at the end of the tournament. The term comes from "Cinderella", a well-known European folk tale embodying a myth-element of unjust oppression/triumphant reward. The title character is a woman living in unfortunate circumstances that are suddenly changed to remarkable fortune. In a sporting context the term has been used at least since 1939, but came into widespread usage in 1950, when the Disney movie came out that year, and in reference to City College of New York, the unexpected winners of the NCAA Men's Basketball championship also that year. The term was used by Bill Murray in the 1980 hit movie "Caddyshack" where he pretends as the announcer to his own golf fantasy: "Cinderella story. Outta nowhere. A former greenskeeper, now, about to become the Masters champion."

Maryland's Western Shore (not to be confused with Western Maryland) is an area of Maryland west of the Chesapeake Bay. Originally, it included all areas not on the Eastern Shore and some colonial and later state government functions were administered separately for each region. The term no longer identifies an official region of Maryland and is used in contrast to the "Eastern Shore", which has long had a distinct historical, cultural, sociological, and economic character and sense of personality, well known in American and state history, politics and events, especially before the 1952 construction of the Gov. William Preston Lane Memorial Bridge (Chesapeake Bay Bridge). William Preston (August 26, 1921 – July 10, 1998) did not start his acting career until he was at the age of 47 but subsequently appeared in more than sixty productions of Shakespeare's plays. He had a Master's degree in English literature from Penn State. He is perhaps best known for his role as recurring character Carl "Oldy" Olson on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien".

Scenes set on the coast of Sierra Leone were filmed at various locations on the North Carolina coast, particularly Fort Anderson and Fort Macon. Interiors and green screen special effects shots were filmed in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The film stars Erik Nelson as the young John Newton. The film premiered at the deCoste Centre in Pictou, on May 13, 2017.

Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and the lowest amount of precipitation of any weather station in Canada. Fort Gibson is a historic military site located next to the present day city of Fort Gibson, in Muskogee County Oklahoma. It guarded the American frontier in Indian Territory from 1824 until 1888. When constructed, the fort lay farther west than any other military post in the United States; it formed part of the north–south chain of forts intended to maintain peace on the frontier of the American West and to protect the southwestern border of the Louisiana Purchase. The fort succeeded in its peacekeeping mission for more than 50 years, as no massacres or battles occurred there.

Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, "Out of Exile", it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. The Monashee Mountains are a mountain range lying mostly in British Columbia, Canada, extending into the U.S. state of Washington. They stretch 530 km from north to south and 150 km from east to west. They are a sub-range of the Columbia Mountains. They are limited on the eastern side by the Columbia River and Arrow Lakes, beyond which lie the Selkirk Mountains, and by the upper North Thompson River and the Interior Plateau on the west. The northern end of the range is at the southern end of the Robson Valley just south of the town of Valemount. The southern extremity of the range is in Washington State, where the Kettle River Range reaches just down to the confluence of the Kettle River and the Columbia, and also farther west to the southern extremity of the Okanagan Highland (spelled Okanogan Highland in the US) just northeast of the confluence of the Okanogan and Columbia rivers at Brewster and Bridgeport. Pennsylvania Route 382 (PA 382) is an 11.8 mi state highway located in York County, Pennsylvania. The southern terminus is at PA 181 in York Haven. The western terminus is at PA 114 near Bunches in Fairview Township. PA 382 is a two-lane undivided road that runs through rural areas in the northern part of York County. The route heads west from York Haven, intersecting PA 262 and PA 295. Farther west, the road has an interchange with Interstate 83 (I-83) in Newberrytown and an intersection with PA 177 in Lewisberry. From here, PA 382 turns north and continues to its terminus at PA 114. What is now PA 382 was designated as a portion of PA 24 in 1928. PA 382 was designated to its current alignment in the 1960s after the northern terminus of PA 24 was truncated to the York area. Fort Harker, located in Kanopolis, Kansas, was an active military installation of the United States Army from November 17, 1866 to October 5, 1872. The fortification was named after General Charles Garrison Harker, who was killed in action at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain in the American Civil War. Fort Harker replaced Fort Ellsworth, which had been located 1.6 km from the location of Fort Harker and was abandoned after the new fortifications at Fort Harker were constructed. Fort Harker was a major distribution point for all military points farther west and was one of the most important military stations west of the Missouri River. Register Cliff is a sandstone cliff and featured key navigational landmark prominently listed in the 19th century guidebooks about the Oregon Trail, and a place where many emigrants chiseled the names of their families on the soft stones of the cliff it was one of the key checkpoint landmarks for parties heading west along the Platte River valley west of Fort John, Wyoming which allowed travelers to verify they were on the correct path up to South Pass and not moving into impassable mountain terrainsgeographically, it is on the eastern ascent of the Continental divide leading upward out of the great plains in the east of the U.S. state of Wyoming. It is notable as a historic landmark for 'registering' hundreds of emigrants on the Oregon Trail (thus also the other northern Emigrant Trails that split off farther west such as the California Trail and Mormon Trail) who came to follow custom and inscribed their names on its rocks during the western migrations of the 19th century. An estimated 500,000 emigrants used these trails from 1843–1869, with up to one-tenth dying along the way, usually due to disease. State Highway 77, or SH 77, is a numbered state highway in Texas, occupying the counties of Morris and Cass. SH 77 is 46.815 mi long, and connects U.S. Highway 259 to the eastern state line. It begins four miles (6 km) north of Omaha on US 259, and travels eastward to Naples, meeting U.S. Highway 67 and State Highway 338. In Douglassville, SH 77 intersects State Highway 8. After cutting across the south side of Atlanta, where it meets U.S. Highway 59 (Future Interstate 369), SH 77 cuts to the southeast, and crosses into the very northwest corner of Louisiana, becoming Louisiana Highway 1. SH 77 was originally proposed in 1926 as a route from Douglasville to Naples, replacing SH 1B. By 1933, SH 77 extended southeast to Louisiana, replacing a portion of SH 47. It was originally planned to travel farther west to Commerce, but this plan was cancelled in 1941. In 1966, SH 77 was extended west over FM 2880 from US 259 to US 67.

**Question:** Are both French Spaniel and Beagle universally recognized breeds?
**Answer:** no

**Context:**
The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family. Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused. The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a breed of dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was developed in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct by the turn of the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition. The Beaglier is a designer breed, the offspring of a Beagle and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Beaglier became particularly popular through crossbreeding programs in Australia during the 1990s. The dog was developed because of affection for the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Beagle breeds; the breeders were looking for a healthy, energetic small dog with a less active scent drive than that of the Beagle. They are very popular in Australia due to their temperaments. The Beaglier typically has the shorter and more rounded muzzle of the Cavalier. Beagliers have variable coat colours and markings. The Picardy Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in France for use as a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections. Varieties are often confused with breeds. Only eight breeds of turkey are recognized by the APA in its breed standard, the "American Standard of Perfection". Also there are eight domestic turkeys that are recognized by the American Poultry Association (APA). Many more exist as officially unrecognized variants or as recognized breeds in other countries. This is a list of goat breeds. There are many recognized breeds of domestic goat "(Capra aegagrus hircus)". Goat breeds (especially dairy goats) are some of the oldest defined animal breeds for which breed standards and production records have been kept. Selective breeding of goats generally focuses on improving production of fiber, meat, dairy products or goatskin. Breeds are generally classified based on their primary use, though there are several breeds which are considered dual- or multi-purpose goats, so there is some crossover between lists. Water spaniel (capitalized in the names of recognized breeds) was originally a term for water dogs generally, and today refer to several different breeds of water dogs that actually are spaniels, such as: The Beagle is a breed of small hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems. The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog. It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as "Cocker Spaniel" before the American variety was created. The word "cocker" is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while "spaniel" is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain. The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Asian cat. Derived from the Wichianmat landrace, one of several varieties of cat native to Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. The carefully refined modern Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes; a triangular head shape; large ears; an elongated, slender, and muscular body; and point colouration. (Aside from the colouration, it bears little resemblance to the original stock, and the more moderate, traditional or "old-style" Siamese, with a much rounder head and body, has been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat.) The International Cat Association describes the modern Siamese as social, intelligent, and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch. Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like companionship from other cats.

**Question:**  "Prostitute" is a song written by Axl Rose and Paul Tobias with additional work by an American guitarist has played in two different bands on a list of what? 
**Answer:** 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock

**Context:**
"One in a Million" is a song by American rock band Guns N' Roses. It is the eighth track on the album "G N' R Lies" and was released in 1988. The lyrics describe Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose's experience of getting hustled in the Greyhound bus station upon first arriving in Los Angeles. The song is notable not only for its controversy, but also for being one of the first Guns N' Roses songs that Axl Rose wrote solo. According to interviews, Rose wrote "One in a Million" on guitar (with which he was not proficient at the time), using only the bottom two strings. This differs from other Rose-written Guns N' Roses songs, which Rose composed on piano or keyboards. This is the first Guns N' Roses song to feature piano, played by Rose on the outro. Jesse Tobias (born April 1, 1972) is an American guitarist who has been the guitarist/co-writer for Morrissey since 2005. Tobias first gained notoriety during a brief tenure with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1993, although he was replaced by Dave Navarro within a month after joining the band. Before he joined the Chili Peppers, he briefly played with L.A.-based band Mother Tongue. In 1996, Tobias joined the touring band for Alanis Morissette and from 1999-2005 was a member of the musical duo, Splendid. Robert John "Robin" Finck (born November 7, 1971) is an American guitarist. He is one of only a few artists who has played in two different bands listed on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock": Nine Inch Nails (ranked no. 43) and Guns N' Roses (ranked no. 9). Guns N' Roses, often abbreviated as GNR, is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles and formed in 1985. The lineup, when first signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. Guns N' Roses have released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including 45 million records in the United States, making them one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. Fire and Gasoline is a heavy metal album released in 1989 by British musician Steve Jones, formerly of the Sex Pistols. The album featured Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses on the song "I Did U No Wrong" and the lyrics of Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe on "We're Not Saints". The album was co-produced by Ian Astbury of The Cult, who also sings backing vocals on the album, while Cult guitarist Billy Duffy plays guitar on the song "Get Ready" and then-current Cult drummer Mickey Curry plays throughout the album. Chris Weber (born October 16, 1966) is an American musician best known as the guitarist and founder of the groups U.P.O. and Hollywood Rose (which featured future Guns N' Roses members Axl Rose, Slash, Izzy Stradlin, and Steven Adler). With U.P.O., he released two albums, "No Pleasantries" (2000) and "The Heavy" (2004), while the Hollywood Rose demos, recorded in 1984, were released in 2004 titled "The Roots of Guns N' Roses". "Prostitute" is the fourteenth and final track from "Chinese Democracy", Guns N' Roses' sixth studio album released in 2008. The song dates back to at least 1999, as it was mentioned in a July issue of "Spin" Magazine; ""Rose is laboring over a song with the working title 'Prostitute', according to Youth, but past successes weigh heavily on him..."" The song is written by Axl Rose and Paul Tobias with additional work by Robin Finck. City of Evil is the third studio album by Avenged Sevenfold released on June 7, 2005 by Warner Bros. Records. Co-produced by Andrew Murdock, "City of Evil" contains a more traditional heavy metal and hard rock sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous two albums, which showcased a predominantly metalcore sound. The album is also notable for the absence of screaming vocals. M. Shadows worked for months before the album's release with vocal coach Ron Anderson, whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell, to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having the tone". In order to increase stamina and strength on the pedals, The Rev would sit for hours practicing until he could get up to 210 beats per minute. The album was ranked No. 63 on "Guitar World" magazine's "100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time". City of Evil also appears in Kerrang's "666 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" and "50 Albums You Need To Hear Before You Die" The album was ranked No. 35 in Kerrang's list of "50 Greatest Metal Albums Ever" in 2016.

**Question:** Are Roger Waters and Tom Johnston both musicians?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
"Time" is the fourth track from the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd's 1973 album "The Dark Side of the Moon", and the only song on the album credited to all four members of the band, though the lyrics were written by Roger Waters. It is the final Pink Floyd song credited to all four members and the last to feature Richard Wright on lead vocals until "Wearing the Inside Out" on "The Division Bell". This song is about how time can slip by, but many people do not realise it until it is too late. Roger Waters got the idea when he realised he was no longer preparing for anything in life, but was right in the middle of it. He has described this realisation taking place at ages 28 and 29 in various interviews. It is noted for its long introductory passage of clocks chiming and alarms ringing, recorded as a quadrophonic test by Alan Parsons, not specifically for the album. George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English singer, songwriter, bassist, and composer.

**Question:** The player who laid motionless for ten minutes in the Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident was born in which year ?
**Answer:** 1978

**Context:**
Too Many Cooks was a British cookery competition on ITV in 2004 and 2005 where four teams of two people competitively cooked for three judges. Each team was told what to cook and were given ten minutes to cook a starter, twenty minutes to cook a main course, and ten minutes to cook a pudding. A couple got eliminated after each course, leaving two teams to compete at the pudding stage. "Ten Minutes" is the first single from The Get Up Kids' album "Something to Write Home About". The single was released as part of the Sub Pop Records Singles Club. 1300 pressings were black, with only 100 pressings of the single on clear vinyl. On July 2, 2005 The Get Up Kids performed for the last time before their hiatus at the Uptown Theater in Kansas City, MO. "Ten Minutes" was the last song they played. Alpha and Omega is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated adventure romantic comedy-drama film directed by Anthony Bell and Ben Gluck. Starring Justin Long, Hayden Panettiere, Dennis Hopper, Danny Glover and Christina Ricci, the film was written by Christopher Denk and Steve Moore, based on a story by Moore and Gluck. The Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident (also called the Steve Moore incident, the Todd Bertuzzi incident, and the Bertuzzi–Moore incident) was a highly controversial event in ice hockey that happened during a National Hockey League (NHL) game between the Vancouver Canucks and the Colorado Avalanche on March 8, 2004. In the first period, Steve Moore fought Vancouver player Matt Cooke and served a 5-minute major penalty for fighting. The Avalanche would go on to build up a large lead in a fight-filled game. Late in the third period, Todd Bertuzzi was sent onto the ice. After failing to instigate Moore to fight, Bertuzzi skated after Moore, grabbed his jersey and punched him in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. Bertuzzi landed on top of him, driving Moore face first into the ice followed by Moore's teammate Andrei Nikolishin and Bertuzzi's teammate Sean Pronger. Moore was knocked out and lay motionless for ten minutes before being carried off on a stretcher. The combination of the hit, fall, and piling-on had resulted in three fractured neck vertebrae, facial cuts and a concussion. The incident ended Moore's professional hockey career, and resulted in criminal assault charges against Bertuzzi, and a civil lawsuit against Bertuzzi and the Canucks. On August 19, 2014, it was reported the civil trial ended with all parties agreeing to a confidential settlement. Ten Minutes Older is a 2002 film project consisting of two compilation feature films titled "The Trumpet" and "The Cello". The project was conceived by the producer Nicolas McClintock as a reflection on the theme of time at the turn of the Millennium. Fifteen celebrated film-makers were invited to create their own vision of what time means in ten minutes of film. The music for the compilations was composed by Paul Englishby, and performed by Hugh Masekela (trumpet) and Claudio Bohorques (cello). Steven Francis Moore (born September 22, 1978) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey center who played in parts of three National Hockey League (NHL) seasons with the Colorado Avalanche.

It attempted to render many of the basic techniques of classic French cooking into a quick form for people who did not have time to cook. The ATM 2000 (Pz Mi 88) and ATM 2000E are Austrian plastic cased anti-vehicle mines using Misznay Schardin effect warhead.

**Question:** Which beverage is ignited prior to consumption, Flaming beverage or Blue Hawaii
**Answer:** Flaming beverages

**Context:**
Blue Sky Beverage Company is an all natural beverage company that produces a large selection of natural soft drinks and energy drinks. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Monster Beverage Corporation. The company was established in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1980 where it remained until it was purchased by Monster (then Hansen Beverage) in 2000. Coca-Cola North America took ownership of Blue Sky Sodas, Hansen’s Juice Products, Hansen’s Natural Sodas, Hubert’s Lemonade, Peace Tea and other non-energy drink brands as part of Coke’s partnership with Monster Beverage Corp on Jun 12, 2015. "Till mitt eget Blue Hawaii" is a song written by Rose-Marie Stråhle, and recorded by Vikingarna on the 1990 album "Kramgoa låtar 18". With lyrics about Hawaii, it became a major Svensktoppen hit, staying at the chart for 23 weeks during the period 7 January-13 May 1990, and held first position for the first nine weeks. In October 1989, the song won "Hänts meloditävling". Flaming beverages include cocktails and other mixed drinks that contain flammable, high-proof alcohol, which is ignited prior to consumption. The alcohol may be an integral part of the drink, or it may be floated as a thin layer across the top of the drink. The flames are mostly for dramatic flair. However, in combination with certain ingredients, the flavor of the drink is altered. Some flavors are enhanced, and it may impart a toasted flavor to some drinks. The Blue Hawaii is a tropical cocktail made of rum, pineapple juice, Curaçao, sweet and sour mix, and sometimes vodka as well. It should not be confused with the similarly named Blue Hawaiian cocktail (also known as the Swimming Pool cocktail) that contains creme of coconut instead of sweet and sour mix. Juice is a beverage made from the extraction or pressing out of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood (e.g., clam juice). Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods allowed for its preservation without using fermentation (the approach used with wine production). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated the total world production of citrus fruit juices to be 12,840,318 tonnes in 2012. The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increased with country income level. To the American food industry, fruit juice is more profitable than only fruit. Blue on Blue is Bobby Vinton's sixth studio album, released in 1963. Cover versions include the jazz songs "St. Louis Blues" and "Blueberry Hill", "Am I Blue", "Blue, Blue Day", the Fleetwoods' hit "Mr. Blue", "My Blue Heaven", three show tunes ("Blue Skies", "Blue Hawaii" and "Blue Moon"), and The Clovers Rhythm and blues hit, "Blue Velvet". The U.S. state of Oregon has an extensive history of laws regulating the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, dating back to 1844. It has been an alcoholic beverage control state, with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission holding a monopoly over the sale of all distilled beverages, since Prohibition. Today, there are thriving industries producing beer, wine, and liquor in the state. Alcohol may be purchased between 7 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. As of 2007, consumption of spirits is on the rise, while beer consumption is holding steady. Also, 11% of beer sold in Oregon was brewed in-state, the highest figure in the United States. Blue Hawaii is the fourteenth album by American singer and musician Elvis Presley, released on RCA Victor Records in mono and stereo, LPM/LSP 2426, on October 20, 1961. It is the soundtrack to the 1961 film of the same name starring Presley. Recording sessions took place at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on March 21, 22, and 23, 1961. In the United States, the album spent 20 weeks at the number one slot and 39 weeks in the Top 10 on "Billboard"' s Top Pop LPs chart. It was certified Gold on December 21, 1961, Platinum and 2x Platinum on March 27, 1992 and 3x Platinum on July 30, 2002 by the Recording Industry Association of America. On the US Top Pop Albums chart "Blue Hawaii" is second only to the soundtrack of "West Side Story" as the most successful album of the 1960s. The legal drinking age in India and the laws which regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol vary significantly from state to state. In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Gujarat, Bihar and Nagaland as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. There is a partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur. All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but fix a legal drinking age, which ranges at different ages per region. In some states, the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverage. The YF-77 is China's first cryogenic rocket engine developed for booster applications. It burns liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer using a gas generator cycle. A pair of these engines will power the LM-5 core stage. Each engine can independently gimbal in two planes. Although the YF-77 is ignited prior to liftoff, the LM-5's four strap-on boosters will provide most of the initial thrust in an arrangement similar to the European Vulcain on the Ariane 5 or the Japanese LE-7 on the H-II. Like the Vulcain, the YF-77 uses the less efficient gas generator cycle and even for that application it has less performance than the European engine.

**Question:** Graveraet River is a tributary of a lake that is shared between which US states ?
**Answer:** Minnesota to the west, and Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the south

**Context:**
Great East Lake is an 1825 acre water body located in Carroll County, New Hampshire, and York County, Maine, in the United States. The lake is shared by the towns of Wakefield, New Hampshire, and Acton, Maine, with 45% of its surface area in Acton and 55% in Wakefield. The lake is the farthest upstream of the five headwater lakes of the Salmon Falls River, a tributary of the Piscataqua River. Water from Great East Lake flows out its dam and through the 800 ft Newichawannock Canal into Horn Pond, then into the Salmon Falls River below Horn Pond. Lake Superior is the largest of the Great Lakes of North America. The lake is shared by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north, the US state of Minnesota to the west, and Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the south. It is generally considered the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. It is the world's third-largest freshwater lake by volume and the largest by volume in North America. The furthest north and west of the Great Lakes chain, Superior has the highest elevation and drains into the St. Mary's River. The Bumping River is a tributary of the Naches River, in Washington in the United States. It flows down the east side of the Cascade Range, through Wenatchee National Forest and the William O. Douglas Wilderness. From its source at Fish Lake near Crag Mountain, it flows northeast to Bumping Lake, a natural lake enlarged and regulated by Bumping Lake Dam. Below the dam, the Bumping River continues flowing northeast. It is joined by the American River, its main tributary, a few miles above its mouth where it joins the Little Naches River to form the Naches River. The Portage River is an 8.8 mi tributary of the Moose Horn River in eastern Minnesota, United States. It flows west to the Moose Horn River, joining it at Moosehead Lake next to the city of Moose Lake. By the Moose Horn River, its waters flow to the Kettle River, St. Croix River, and ultimately the Mississippi River. Just to the east of the Portage River, Nemadji Creek flows east to the Nemadji River, a tributary of Lake Superior and part of the Saint Lawrence River basin. The Schoolcraft River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately 30 mi (48 km) long, in northern Minnesota in the United States. Although short, it is considered as the first major tributary of the Mississippi, since it is the first river that joins the Mississippi below its source that is nearly the same size as the Mississippi itself. The river is named after Henry Schoolcraft, who mapped the region and discovered nearby Lake Itasca as the source of the Mississippi in 1831. Its name in the Ojibwe language is "Ozaawindibe-ziibi" (Yellow-head River), named after Ozaawindib who guided Schoolcraft to the nearby "Omashkoozo-zaaga'igan" (Elk Lake), which Schoolcraft then named Lake Itasca. Prior to being named for these early explorers it had been called the "Naiwa River" The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington, then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The river is 1243 mi long, and its largest tributary is the Snake River. Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province. The fourth-largest river in the United States by volume, the Columbia has the greatest flow of any North American river entering the Pacific. The Straight River is a 15.5 mi tributary of the Apple River located entirely within Polk County, Wisconsin in the United States. The Straight River rises in wetlands west of Straight Lake in Straight Lake State Park. After exiting Straight Lake, the river flows generally southeastward toward Big Round Lake in the town of Georgetown. From Big Round, the Straight flows through Little and Big Blake lakes, before meeting Fox Creek, the outlet of Bone Lake. Below the confluence, Fox Creek flows southward for 5.2 mi , roughly parallel to County Road I/H, before meeting the Apple River a few miles west of White Ash Lake within the town of Apple River. The West Branch Lackawanna River (also known as Ball Creek) is a tributary of the Lackawanna River in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately 9.5 mi long and flows through Ararat Township, Herrick Township, and Union Dale. The watershed of the river has an area of 16.8 sqmi .

The Red Rock River is a roughly 70 mi river in southwestern Montana in the United States. Its drainage basin covers over 1548 mi2 . Its furthest tributary, Hell Roaring Creek, originates in the Beaverhead National Forest within a few hundred meters of the North American Continental Divide and Montana-Idaho border near Brower's Spring, at an elevation of about 9100 ft . Brower's Spring is near the furthest headwaters of the Missouri River, one of the major watercourses of the central United States. The drainage flows north and west with its name changing to "Red Rock Creek" into the Red Rock Lakes in the middle of a wide grassy valley; the Red Rock River issues from the west side of Lower Red Rock Lake. It flows west, receiving many tributaries such as Peet Creek and Long Creek, widening into the Lima Reservoir and then passing through a canyon, which ends near Lima, Montana. From there, it flows northwest through a valley, passing Kidd and Red Rock, and into Clark Canyon Reservoir. Under the waters of the lake was once the confluence of the Red Rock and Horse Prairie Creek, forming the Beaverhead River, a tributary of the Jefferson River, in turn a headwater of the Missouri River.

The park was built and operated by the Minneapolis and St. Paul Suburban Railroad Company, a subdivision of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company, which ran a streetcar line from Mahtomedi to nearby St. Paul. It was the sister park of Big Island Amusement Park on Lake Minnetonka, as both were intended to draw crowds of people to opposite ends of the Minneapolis-St. Paul streetcar system on weekends. Wildwood Amusement Park proved to be more successful than Big Island Amusement Park, which closed in 1911, and lasted until 1932 when financial losses brought about its demise. Pontins is the trading name of Britannia Jinky Jersey Ltd, a company operating holiday parks in the UK. The original Pontins company was founded in 1946 by Fred Pontin.

They usually cater to "sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas." FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. FECs are sometimes called family amusement centers, play zones, family fun centers, or simply fun centers. Some non-traditional FECs, called urban entertainment centers (UECs), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations.

**Question:** Which Austrian and later American chess master who was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician competed for the first contest  that was defined "in advance" as being for the world championship?
**Answer:** Steinitz

**Context:**
Spencer Crakanthorp, (17 February 1885 in Sydney, Australia – 1 August 1936) was a chess player and Australian Chess Champion in 1923−24, 1925−26, 1926 and 1927. He was the father-in-law of chess master Cecil Purdy who married Anne Purdy (née Crakanthorp, 1915–2013). Anne was a strong A Grade chess player in her own right. He was also grandfather to another chess master, Cecil's son John Purdy. Furthermore, Crakanthrop's granddaughter Diana Hutchings (née Purdy) married Frank Huntchings - winner of the 1953 New Zealand junior chess championship while his father (Lawrence Crakanthorp) (1857-1929) was ranked world no 188 in the 1902 historical world rating list. Therefore, the Crakanthorp-Purdy family can be recognized as one of the greatest chess dynasties ever. The concept of a world chess champion started to emerge in the first half of the 19th century, and the phrase "world champion" appeared in 1845. From this time onwards various players were "acclaimed" as world champions, but the first contest that was defined "in advance" as being for the world championship was the match between Steinitz and Zukertort in 1886. Until 1948 world championship contents were matches arranged privately between the players. As a result, the players also had to arrange the funding, in the form of stakes provided by enthusiasts who wished to bet on one of the players. In the early 20th century this was sometimes a barrier that prevent or delayed challenges for the title. The monthly Chess Life and bi-monthly Chess Life Kids (formerly School Mates and Chess Life for Kids ) are the official magazines published by the United States Chess Federation (US Chess). "Chess Life" is advertised as the "most widely read chess magazine in the world," and reaches more than a quarter of a million readers each month. It focuses on American chess players and tournaments, instruction, human interest, and US Chess governance matters. "Chess Life for Kids" is geared towards those under 14. A subscription to "Chess Life" and "Chess Life for Kids" is currently one benefit of becoming a US Chess member or affiliate. All members are given access to the online versions of "Chess Life" and "Chess Life for Kids" (including back issues). Affiliates and some membership categories also receive printed copies of "Chess Life" and/or "Chess Life for Kids". Alexander Kevitz (September 1, 1902 – October 24, 1981) was an American chess master. Kevitz also played correspondence chess, and was a creative chess analyst and theoretician. He was a pharmacist by profession. David Graham Baird (3 December 1854 in New York City – 8 October 1913 in Elizabeth, New Jersey) was an American chess master. He was the brother of John Washington Baird, who was also an American chess master. A writer in the "New York Times", describing the players in the Sixth American Chess Congress (1889), portrayed Baird and his brother as follows: Paul Charles Morphy (June 22, 1837 – July 10, 1884) was an American chess player. He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era and an unofficial World Chess Champion. He was a chess prodigy. He was called "The Pride and Sorrow of Chess" because he had a brilliant chess career but retired from the game while still young. Bobby Fischer included him in his list of the ten greatest players of all time, and described him as "perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived". Wilhelm (later William) Steinitz (May 17, 1836 – August 12, 1900) was an Austrian and later American chess master, and the first undisputed world chess champion, from 1886 to 1894. He was also a highly influential writer and chess theoretician. John Washington Baird (February 22, 1852-1923) was a minor American chess master, who played in a number of American and international chess tournaments between 1880 and 1906. He was the brother of David Graham Baird, who was also an American chess master. James Eade (born March 23, 1957) is an American chess master, chess administrator, chess tournament organizer, and chess book publisher. He holds the title of FIDE Master.

The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals focusing especially on viral advertising through online vehicles such as YouTube, Myspace, and online forums. In the case of lesser-known candidates it is also intended to generate significant free mass media coverage the candidate would otherwise not receive. Moneybombs have been used for grassroots fundraising and viral activism over the Internet by several 2008 presidential candidates in the United States.

**Question:** John Rhys-Davies played General Pushkin in the Bond Film that starred whom as James Bond?
**Answer:** Timothy Dalton

**Context:**
The "James Bond Theme" is the main signature theme of the James Bond films and has featured in every Eon Productions Bond film since "Dr. No", released in 1962. The piece has been used as an accompanying fanfare to the gun barrel sequence in almost every James Bond film. Casino Royale is a 1967 spy comedy film originally produced by Columbia Pictures featuring an ensemble cast. It is loosely based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. The film stars David Niven as the "original" Bond, Sir James Bond 007. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and SMERSH. The film's tagline: "Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be "James Bond", namely, baccarat master Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers), millionaire spy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress), Bond's secretary Miss Moneypenny (Barbara Bouchet), Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), Bond's daughter by Mata Hari; and British agents "Coop" (Terence Cooper) and "The Detainer" (Daliah Lavi). Wet Nellie is a custom-built submarine, created for the 1977 James Bond film "The Spy Who Loved Me" in the shape of a Lotus Esprit S1 sports car. The Esprit was chosen to give James Bond a glamorous car to drive. "Wet Nellie" is named in reference to Little Nellie, an autogyro featured in the James Bond film "You Only Live Twice". Little Nellie was named after Nellie Wallace. The Living Daylights (1987) is the fifteenth entry in the "James Bond" film series and the first to star Timothy Dalton as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by John Glen, the film's title is taken from Ian Fleming's short story "The Living Daylights".

Bond Girls Are Forever is a 2002 James Bond documentary film hosted by actress Maryam d'Abo, who had played the role of Kara Milovy in the 15th James Bond film "The Living Daylights". It was accompanied by a 2003 book written by John Cork and d'Abo. The book is subtitled The Women of James Bond. Both the film and the book is a tribute to the elite club of women who have played the role of a Bond girl. Ian Fleming, the writer who created the fictional character James Bond, lived to see the success of his novels depicted on screen before he died. All fourteen books in the series created by Fleming went on to be huge successes on screen. Goldfinger, one of the most epic stories in the James Bond saga, became a fan favorite with Shirley Bassey singing the iconic song, Goldfinger, that was played for the fiftieth anniversary of the Bond series at the Oscars in 2012. Bond was played by Sean Connery and George Lazenby in the movies shot throughout the 60s. The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones. The success of each Bond film lead to bigger budget prices for the following films adapted to the big screen. Each movie recovered its budget and won critically acclaimed awards the years that they came out. Of all the Bond films in cinema today, Thunderball is the most successful movie with the whole Bond series being the third highest grossing of all time in Hollywood cinema. Sky Movies 007 HD was a premium subscription television movie channel in the United Kingdom and Ireland operated by BSkyB. The channel was dedicated to the James Bond films and first went on-air on 5 October 2012 after Sky secured the broadcasting rights to the back catalogue of Bond films, and to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the first Bond film, "Dr. No" in 1962. After initially airing for a month to celebrate the anniversary the channel returned from 1 January 2013 to 21 January 2013, then again in February. Its last airdate was 17 August 2013. In November 2013, ITV re-acquired the franchise after signing a deal with the distributor, and the films returned to terrestrial television. On 8 July 2016 Sky Movies was rebranded as Sky Cinema. As part of the rebrand, Sky acquired the rights to show the latest James Bond film (Spectre). James Bond 007: Goldfinger is a 1986 text adventure video game developed by Angelsoft and published by Mindscape for the IBM PC, Apple II, and Macintosh. It was the follow-up to the 1985 game "James Bond 007: A View to a Kill". It is based on the James Bond film series. Future James Bond author Raymond Benson worked on the development of this game. Live and Let Die (1973) is the eighth spy film in the "James Bond" series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, it was the third of four Bond films to be directed by Guy Hamilton. Although the producers had wanted Sean Connery to return after his role in the previous Bond film "Diamonds Are Forever", he declined, sparking a search for a new actor to play James Bond.

The tour was performed from 28 April to 9 August 2008 with three "warm-up" dates. It has been called "not only hilarious but quite remarkable." As for the name of the tour, Izzard says he called it "Stripped" because"The heels got too high on the last two tours. Now I've just gone back to blokey mode, so I've got all this movement back which I couldn't do before. The set is leaner, what I'm wearing is leaner and just focusing on what I'm talking about. I keep talking about God and I come to all these different conclusions. I'm talking about the whole civilization, trying to strip that back, as well. The last 5,000 years we did everything. I put out my idea what we're doing here. I think it's all random. If there is a God, his plan is very similar to someone not having a plan."

**Question:** Masters and Johnson labeled the orgasmic platform while researching what?
**Answer:** nature of human sexual response

**Context:**
The Masters and Johnson research team, composed of William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, pioneered research into the nature of human sexual response and the diagnosis and treatment of sexual disorders and dysfunctions from 1957 until the 1990s. Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love is a 2009 biography by Thomas Maier. The book chronicles the early lives and work of two American sexologists, Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson, who studied human sexuality from 1957 to the 1990s. The 2013 Showtime television series "Masters of Sex", starring Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan, is based on the book. Suspension array technology (or SAT) is a high throughput, large-scale, and multiplexed screening platform used in molecular biology. SAT has been widely applied to genomic and proteomic research, such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, genetic disease screening, gene expression profiling, screening drug discovery and clinical diagnosis. SAT uses microsphere beads (5.6 um in diameter) to prepare arrays. SAT allows for the simultaneous testing of multiple gene variants through the use of these microsphere beads as each type of microsphere bead has a unique identification based on variations in optical properties, most common is fluorescent colour. As each colour and intensity of colour has a unique wavelength, beads can easily be differentiated based on their wavelength intensity. Microspheres are readily suspendable in solution and exhibit favorable kinetics during an assay. Similar to flat microarrays (e.g. DNA microarray), an appropriate receptor molecule, such as DNA oligonucleotide probes, antibodies, or other proteins, attach themselves to the differently labeled microspheres. This produces thousands of microsphere array elements. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected by optically labeled targets, which determines the relative abundance of each target in the sample. "Masters of Sex" is an American television drama series developed for television by Michelle Ashford and based on the biography "Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love" by Thomas Maier. "Masters of Sex" tells the story of Dr. William Masters (Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (Lizzy Caplan), two pioneering researchers of human sexuality at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. The series premiered on September 29, 2013 on Showtime. The series was cancelled after its fourth season. The human sexual response cycle is a four-stage model of physiological responses to sexual stimulation, which, in order of their occurrence, are the excitement phase, plateau phase, orgasmic phase, and resolution phase. This physiological response model was first formulated by William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson in their 1966 book "Human Sexual Response". Since then, other human sexual response models have been formulated. Stacie Powell (born 18 December 1985) is a British diver and astronomer. She represented her country at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing (10 metre platform and synchronized 10 metre platform) and at the 2012 Summer Olympics (10 metre platform). She is also a postgraduate student in astrophysics at the Institute of Astronomy Cambridge, researching FU Orionis. While an undergraduate at the University of Southampton she spent a year abroad working at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. The orgasmic platform is the tissues of the outer third of the vagina, labeled by Masters and Johnson. They swell considerably, and the pubococcygeus muscle tightens, reducing the diameter of the opening of the vagina. During orgasm, women experience rhythmic contractions of the orgasmic platform. OneTaste is a business dedicated to researching and teaching the practices of "orgasmic meditation" and "slow sex". Though it embraces certain tenets based in Eastern philosophy, OneTaste's central focus is female orgasm and sexuality, especially in a practice called Orgasmic Meditation.

**Question:** Which magazine is focused more on the adult demographic, Jack and Jill or Paper?
**Answer:** Paper

**Context:**
Jack and Jill is an American bimonthly magazine for children 7 to 12 years old that takes its title from the nursery rhyme of the same name. It features stories and educational activities. Viceland is a Canadian English language Category A specialty channel. Owned by Rogers Media, it is a Canadian version of Vice Media's Viceland network, and broadcasts lifestyle-oriented documentary and reality series aimed towards a young adult demographic. The key demographic or target demographic is a term in commercial broadcasting that refers to the most desirable demographic group to a given advertiser. Key demographics vary by outlet, time of day, and programming type, but they are generally composed of individuals who are younger and more affluent than the general public: "Young adult viewers have been TV's target demographic for decades, because they're thought to have less brand loyalty and more disposable income." In the case of television, most key demographic groups consist of adults who are somewhere in age between 18 and 54. For example, the key demographic for reality television is women with disposable income aged 18 to 34 whereas for the WB Television Network it is "eighteen- to thirty-four-year-old, , viewers" Television programming is tailored to members of its key demographics: "Despite the increase in time-shifting to watch recorded television and shows on the Internet, the use of television as an advertising vehicle is still determined by demographic characteristics or who is watching at what time." The subset of ratings that only includes the key demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds is often referred to as the "key demo". Certain radio formats (especially those dubbed "classic") and television outlets may target persons 35 to 64, especially since the late 2000s recession wiped out many career opportunities for millennials, since the 35–64 demographic has much more disposable income. Mighty Jill Off is a 2D platform independently developed freeware video game designed by Anna Anthropy, with art by James Harvey and music by Andrew Toups. It stars a submissive named Jill, who has a boot fetish and is forced to climb up a tower after her Queen kicks her down it as punishment. Jill does this by jumping and slowly descending over obstacles. Jill can be defeated in one hit by these obstacles, but will return to the last check point. The game serves as an homage to the 1986 arcade game "Mighty Bomb Jack". It had follow-ups, such as "Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition" and "Jill Off With One Hand". Jill made a cameo appearance in the 2010 video game "Super Meat Boy" as a playable character. Paper, stylized as PAPER, is a New York City-based independent magazine focusing on fashion, popular culture, nightlife, music, art and film. Past cover models include Kim Kardashian, Demi Lovato, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Prince, CL, and Jennifer Lopez. Rap-Up is a magazine launched in 2001 by founder Devin Lazerine. The publication was originally a website devoted to hip hop, until Lazerine decided to pitch the possibility of a magazine to several publishers. The magazine is focused on the hip hop and R&B aspect of the music industry, and predominantly features interviews with artists, actors and other entertainers. Issued quarterly, the magazine's target audience was the 14 to 28 demographic, although the demographic has become older over time. The Post-'80 (also the Post-1980, ) is a colloquial term which refers to the generation, especially in urban cities, whose members were born between 1980 and 1989 in Mainland China after the introduction of the One-child policy. This generation, the first to grow up entirely within the reformist era, currently ranges in age from 27 to 37 , making up a major portion of China's young adult demographic. A light novel (ライトノベル , raito noberu ) is a style of Japanese novel primarily, but not exclusively, targeting high-school and middle-school students (young adult demographic). "Light novel" is a "wasei-eigo", or a Japanese term formed from words in the English language. Light novels are often called ranobe (ラノベ ) or LN in the West. The average length of a light novel is about 50,000 words, the equivalent size of an American novel, and light novels are usually published in "bunkobon" size (A6, 10.5 cm × 14.8 cm), often with dense publishing schedules. One of the most remarkable characteristics of a light novel is that they are illustrated with anime and manga art style, often being adapted into such mediums. They are mainly published in separate book volumes, while some of them have their chapters serialized in anthology magazines before collection in book form, comparable to how manga are published. Consideration is the central concept in the common law of contracts and is required, in most cases, for a contract to be enforceable. Consideration is the price one pays for another's promise. It can take a number of forms: money, property, a promise, the doing of an act, or even refraining from doing an act. In broad terms, if one agrees to do something he was not otherwise legally obligated to do, it may be said that he has given consideration. For example, Jack agrees to sell his car to Jill for $100. Jill's payment of $100 (or her promise to do so) is the consideration for Jack's promise to give Jill the car, and Jack's promise to give Jill the car is consideration for Jill's payment of $100. Digital Max is, since 2005, the official mascot for Cox Communications. He is a CGI human character, apparently intended to appeal to the adult demographic.

**Question:** Who was the military commander of the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt?
**Answer:** Athenion

**Context:**
The Ptolemaic army was the army of the Ptolemaic Macedonian kings that ruled Egypt from 305 to 30 BC. Like most of the other armies of the Diadochi, it was very much Macedonian in style, with the use of the long pike ("sarissa") in a deep phalanx formation. Despite the strength of the Ptolemaic army, evinced in 217 BC with the victory over the Seleucids at the Battle of Raphia, the Ptolemaic kingdom itself fell into decline and by the time of Julius Caesar, it was but a mere client-kingdom of the Roman Republic. The army by the time of Caesar’s campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean was a mere shadow of its former self: generally, a highly disorganized assemblage of mercenaries and other foreign troops. Antiochus III the Great (Greek: Ἀντίoχoς Μέγας ; c. 241187 BC, ruled 222–187 BC) was a Hellenistic Greek king and the 6th ruler of the Seleucid Empire. He ruled over the region of Syria and large parts of the rest of western Asia towards the end of the 3rd century BC. Rising to the throne at the age of eighteen in 222 BC, his early campaigns against the Ptolemaic Kingdom were unsuccessful, but in the following years Antiochus gained several military victories and substantially expanded the empire's territory. His traditional designation, "the Great", reflects an epithet he assumed. He also assumed the title "Basileus Megas" (Greek for "Great King"), the traditional title of the Persian kings. A militarily active ruler, Antiochus restored much of the territory of the Seleucid Empire, before suffering a serious setback, towards the end of his reign, in his war against Rome. Egypt–Italy relations refer to relations between Egypt and Italy. Relations were first established during the period of the Roman Republic, when the Ptolemaic Kingdom frequently interacted with Rome, culminating in the Roman annexation of Egypt in 30 BC. With the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and Egypt's continuation as a province of the Eastern Roman Empire until the Islamic conquest in 642 AD, there were no independent states of Italy and Egypt, and as such no diplomatic relations. Cultural ties between Egypt and Italy distanced further over time with the Islamisation of Egypt and the strength of Catholicism in Italy. It would not be until Egypt's official independence from the Ottomans in 1914 that relations with Italy would be reestablished. With the rise of Mussolini and fascism in Italy and the eventual Italian invasion of Egypt during World War II, relations became severely strained. However, after the war, relations were re-established and the countries now have a cordial relationship. Egypt has an embassy in both Rome and Milan, while Italy has an embassy in both Cairo and Alexandria. Egypt and Italy are both members of the Union for the Mediterranean. Cleopatra VII Philopator (Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Φιλοπάτωρ ; 69 – August 12, 30 BC), known to history simply as Cleopatra, was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, briefly survived as pharaoh by her son Caesarion. After her reign, Egypt became a province of the recently established Roman Empire. The name Ptolemy or Ptolemaeus comes from the Greek "Ptolemaios", which seems to mean "warlike" or "son of war". There have been many people named Ptolemy or Ptolemaeus, the most famous of whom are the Greek-Egyptian astronomer Claudius Ptolemaeus, and the Macedonian founder and ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, Ptolemy I Soter. The following sections summarise the history of the name, some of the people named Ptolemy, and some of the other uses of this name. Athenion was in the late 30s BC a military commander of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra in Coele-Syria. Polycrates of Argos, son of Mnasiades, was a Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Raphia, as well as a governor of Cyprus and chancellor of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the late third and early second centuries BC. The Ptolemaic Kingdom ( ; Ancient Greek: Πτολεμαϊκὴ βασιλεία , "Ptolemaïkḕ basileía") was a Hellenistic kingdom based in Egypt. It was ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty which started with Ptolemy I Soter's accession after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and which ended with the death of Cleopatra VII and the Roman conquest in 30 BC. The Ptolemaic dynasty (Ancient Greek: Πτολεμαῖοι , "Ptolemaioi"), sometimes also known as the Lagids or Lagidae (Ancient Greek: Λαγίδαι , "Lagidai", after Lagus, Ptolemy I's father), was a Macedonian Greek royal family, which ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt during the Hellenistic period. Their rule lasted for 275 years, from 305 to 30 BC. They were the last dynasty of ancient Egypt. Ptolemy II Philadelphus (, "Ptolemaîos Philádelphos" ≈ Ptolemy Beloved of his Sibling; 309–246 BCE) was the king of Ptolemaic Egypt from 283 to 246 BCE. He was the son of the founder of the Ptolemaic kingdom Ptolemy I Soter and Berenice, and was educated by Philitas of Cos. He had two half-brothers, Ptolemy Keraunos and Meleager, who both became kings of Macedonia (in 281 BCE and 279 BCE respectively), and who both died in the Gallic invasion of 280–279 BCE. Ptolemy was first married to Arsinoë I, daughter of Lysimachus, who was the mother of his legitimate children; after her repudiation he married his full sister Arsinoë II, the widow of Lysimachus.

**Question:** What nationality was the lover of Lord Alfred Douglas ? 
**Answer:** Irish

**Context:**
Oscar is a British TV serial first transmitted by BBC 2 in March 1985. Michael Gambon portrayed Oscar Wilde while other actors included Robin Lermitte as Lord Alfred Douglas, Tim Hardy as Alfred Taylor, Emily Richard as Constance Wilde and Norman Rodway as the Marquis of Queensberry. The serial concentrated on Wilde's trials and time in prison. The play Oscar Wilde, written by Leslie and Sewell Stokes, is based on the life of the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in which Wilde's friend, the controversial author and journalist Frank Harris, appears as a character. The play, which contains much of Wilde's actual writings, starts with Wilde's literary success and his friendship with Lord Alfred Douglas, turns into a courtroom melodrama, and ends with Wilde as a broken alcoholic after two years in prison. Harold Sherwood Spencer (born 1890, date of death unknown) was an American-born British anti-homosexuality and antisemitic activist during and after World War I. He was closely associated with Noel Pemberton Billing and Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas (22 October 187020 March 1945), nicknamed Bosie, was a British author, poet, translator, and political commentator, better known as the friend and lover of Oscar Wilde. Much of his early poetry was Uranian in theme, though he tended, later in life, to distance himself from both Wilde's influence and his own role as a Uranian poet. Politically he would describe himself as "a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety". Salome's Last Dance is a 1988 film by British film director, Ken Russell. Although most of the action is a verbatim performance of Oscar Wilde's 1893 play "Salome", which is itself based on a story from the New Testament, there is also a framing narrative written by Russell himself. Wilde (Nickolas Grace) and his lover Lord Alfred Douglas (Douglas Hodge) arrive late on Guy Fawkes Day at their friend's brothel, where they are treated to a surprise staging of Wilde's play, public performances of which have just been banned in England by the Lord Chamberlain's office. John Francis Bloxam (1873 – 1928) was an English Uranian author and churchman. Bloxam was an undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford when his story, "the Priest and the Acolyte", appeared in the sole issue of "the Chameleon: a Bazaar of Dangerous and Smiling Chances", a periodical which he also served as editor. The story details the love affair of a priest and his lover, a boy. The affair, when discovered, triggers the priest's suicide. A poem, "A Summer Hour", also with pederastic themes, appeared in "the Artist". The contents of "the Chameleon", which also included Lord Alfred Douglas' notorious poem "Two Loves", would be used against Oscar Wilde in his trial. Bloxam was a convert to Anglo-Catholicism, and became a priest. De Profundis (Latin: "from the depths") is a letter written by Oscar Wilde during his imprisonment in Reading Gaol, to "Bosie" (Lord Alfred Douglas). The Judas Kiss is a 1998 British play by David Hare, about Oscar Wilde's scandal and disgrace at the hands of his young lover Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas). Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was a prolific Irish writer who wrote plays, fiction, essays, and poetry. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays, the novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray", as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death. Maxim Mazumdar (27 January 1952 – 28 April 1988) was an Indo-Canadian playwright and director. He is known for his one-man show, "Oscar Remembered", which tells the story of the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde as seen from the perspective of his lover and nemesis, Lord Alfred Douglas.

**Question:** What is the name of the historic figure whom participated in surveying the borders of the District of Columbia and had a premier African American recreation center named after him?
**Answer:** Benjamin Banneker

**Context:**
Acme-McCrary Hosiery Mills, also known as Acme Hosiery Mills, McCrary Hosiery Mills, and Asheboro Grocery Company, is a historic textile mill complex located at Asheboro, Randolph County, North Carolina.

**Question:** Bridgewater Triangle is an area where the phenomenon associated with what type of tradition has been seen?
**Answer:** Native American

**Context:**
Premenstrual water retention (or premenstrual fluid retention) is a common phenomenon associated with the menstrual cycle. It consists of the retention of water during the period of time immediately preceding the menstrual cycle (that is, the latter half of the luteal phase, or the week before menstruation). This water retention is most noticeable for its temporary enlargement of the breasts. The excess fluid is lost during menstruation. During this event, the water retention can store enough extra fluid to add an extra 5 – of weight. The phenomenon is thought to be caused by high levels of circulating progesterone, as well as of estrogen and prolactin, stimulating secretory cells in the body and in the breasts. In the breasts, increased blood flow is also thought to be involved. Water retention and breast swelling can also be caused by hormonal contraceptives (which contain estrogen and/or a progestogen). Sundowning, or sundown syndrome, is a neurological phenomenon associated with increased confusion and restlessness in patients with delirium or some form of dementia. Most commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, but also found in those with other forms of dementia, the term "sundowning" was coined due to the timing of the patient's confusion. For patients with sundowning syndrome, a multitude of behavioral problems begin to occur in the evening or while the sun is setting. Sundowning seems to occur more frequently during the middle stages of Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. Patients are generally able to understand that this behavioral pattern is abnormal. Sundowning seems to subside with the progression of a patient's dementia. Research shows that 20–45% of Alzheimer's patients will experience some sort of sundowning confusion. Thunderbird is a term used in cryptozoology to describe large, bird-like creatures, generally identified with the Thunderbird of Native American tradition. Similar cryptids reported in the Old World are often called Rocs. Thunderbirds are regarded by a small number of researchers as having lizard features like the extinct pterosaurs such as "Pteranodon". Reports of Thunderbird sightings go back centuries, and the fossil record does show that giant birds (teratorns) with wingspans between 12 and were likely contemporary with early man. Today the creature is generally regarded as a myth. The Patagonia picnic table effect (also known as the Patagonia rest area effect or Patagonia rest stop effect) is a phenomenon associated with birding in which an influx of birdwatchers following the discovery of a rare bird at a location results in the discovery of further rare birds at that location, and so on, with the end result being that the locality becomes well known for rare birds, even though in itself it may be little or no better than other similar localities. An ice marginal lava flow is a phenomenon associated with glaciovolcanism. Glaciovolcanism is the study of volcano and ice interaction, so essentially any and all volcanic activity that interacts with any sort of ice formation The science of glaciovolcanism relatively young in age because, to study it, people must overcome hostile environments. While young, the science of glaciovolcanism can give us clues to in order to reconstruct volcanoes from the past and answer questions regarding whether or not ice was present in a certain area, the thickness of the ice, the surface elevation of the ice sheet and finally the structure of the ice sheet. Glaciovolcanism is increasingly important for volcanic hazard awareness and preparedness, studying the Pleistocene climate record, possible relationships between deglaciation and volcanism, and finally possible Martian geoscience research. In statistics, separation is a phenomenon associated with models for dichotomous or categorical outcomes, including logistic and probit regression. Separation occurs if the predictor (or a linear combination of some subset of the predictors) is associated with only one outcome value when the predictor is greater than some constant. The cold drop (Spanish: "gota fría" ) is a weather phenomenon often occurring in the Spanish autumn. It is experienced particularly along the western Mediterranean and as such, most frequently affects the east coast of Spain. It is a closed upper-level low which has become completely displaced (cut off) from basic westerly current, and moves independently of that current. Cutoff lows may remain nearly stationary for days, or on occasion may move westward opposite to the prevailing flow aloft (i.e., retrogression). The term is also used to describe the meteorological phenomenon associated. In Spain, it appears when a front of very cold polar air, a jet stream, advances slowly over Western Europe, at high altitude (normally 5–9 km or 3–5.5 mi). The Bridgewater Triangle refers to an area of about 200 mi2 within southeastern Massachusetts in the United States, claimed to be a site of alleged paranormal phenomena, ranging from UFOs to poltergeists, orbs, balls of fire and other spectral phenomena, various bigfoot-like sightings, giant snakes and "thunderbirds." "Bennington Triangle" is a phrase coined by New England author Joseph A. Citro during a public radio broadcast in 1992 to denote an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1920 and 1950. This was further popularized in two books, including "Shadow Child", in which he devoted chapters to discussion of these disappearances and various items of folklore surrounding the area. According to Citro, the area shares characteristics with the Bridgewater Triangle in neighboring Massachusetts. Diffraction in time is a phenomenon associated with the quantum dynamics of suddenly released matter waves initially confined in a region of space.

**Question:** Who runs the website surpassed by both Baidu Baike and Hudong.com?
**Answer:** Wikimedia Foundation

**Context:**
Baidu Baike () is a Chinese-language, collaborative, web-based encyclopedia owned and produced by the Chinese search engine Baidu. Its test version was released on 20 April 2006, and within three weeks the encyclopedia had grown to more than 90,000 articles surpassing the number in Chinese Wikipedia. By 2008, Hudong.com had surpassed both in article count, but Baidu Baike later became number one again. The encyclopedia censors its content in accordance with the requirements of the Chinese government. Social media began in the form of generalized online communities. These online communities formed on websites like Geocities.com in 1994, Theglobe.com in 1995, and Tripod.com in 1995. Many of these early communities focused on social interaction by bringing people together through the use of chat rooms. The chat rooms encouraged users to share personal information, ideas, or even personal web pages. Later the social networking community Classmates took a different approach by simply having people link to each other by using their personal email addresses. By the late 1990s, social networking websites began to develop more advanced features to help users find and manage friends. These newer generation of social networking websites began to flourish with the emergence of SixDegrees. com in 1997, Makeoutclub in 2000, Hub Culture in 2002, and Friendster in 2002. However, the first profitable mass social networking website was the South Korean service, Cyworld. Cyworld initially launched as a blog-based website in 1999 and social networking features were added to the website in 2001. Other social networking websites emerged like Myspace in 2002, LinkedIn in 2003, and Bebo in 2005. In 2009, the social networking website Facebook (launched in 2004) became the largest social networking website in the world. Active users of Facebook increased from just a million in 2004 to over 750 million by the year 2011. Making internet-based social networking both a cultural and financial phenomenon. Pan Haidong (潘海东; born 1974 in Dazhou, Sichuan) is the CEO of Chinese online encyclopedia Baike.com. , the largest online encyclopedia in China as of 2009. Baike.com (), formerly Hudong and Hoodong, is a for-profit social network in China, including the world's largest Chinese encyclopedia/news website. It is China's largest wiki site, using paid advertising, with over 7 million articles and more than 5 million volunteers, as of April 2013. Baidu Entertainment Hot Point ( ) is an award ceremony founded by Chinese web services company Baidu to honor most popular celebrities, Televisions, films, and other internet contents. The Baidu Entertainment Hot Point has been held annually since 2008, and cooperated with one of the Chinese most influential Television network Hunan Television to broadcast on television for the first four years. In the fifth year, Baidu started to release the award information on its own website each year. The Chinese Wikipedia () is the (Standard) Chinese language edition of Wikipedia. It is run by the Wikimedia Foundation. Started on 11 May 2001, the Chinese Wikipedia currently has about articles and about registered users, of which have administrative privileges. The Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures (), alternatively Ten Baidu Deities, was initially a humorous hoax from the interactive encyclopedia Baidu Baike which became a popular and widespread Internet meme in the People's Republic of China in early 2009. Spill.com was a movie and video game review, discussion and news website. It was the continuation of the 9 year old Austin, Texas based public-access television cable TV show called "The Reel Deal". There were four main film critic contributors to the website, collectively known as the Spill Crew, including Korey Coleman, Chris Cox, Martin Thomas, C. Robert Cargill, and Tony Guerrero. Under aliases, with the exception of Coleman, they reviewed movies as animated versions of themselves or in uncut audio reviews, maintaining their personas in weekly podcasts. The website was owned by Hollywood.com, under R&S Investments. Stylistically, the site strived to maintain a "down-to-earth vibe." As of July 2013, Spill.com had over 50,000 registered members. On December 6, 2013, it was announced that the site will be shutting down. As of December 20, 2013, The URL for the website now redirects to the Hollywood.com website. Their final review was for the 2013 Disney film "Saving Mr. Banks". Founder Korey Coleman posted on his Facebook page that he cannot share details regarding the shutdown but that he has mostly made peace with "past events" and "everything is fine". He also received funds via a successful Kickstarter to start a new website that will be a spiritual successor to "Spill.com" titled "Double Toasted" alongside Martin Thomas. Chris Cox, better known as Cyrus, since, started his own website "oneofus.net". Baidu Tieba () is the largest Chinese communication platform provided by the Chinese search engine company, Baidu. It is an online community bound tightly with internet search services, one of the main business of Baidu. The website functions by having users search or create a bar (Forum) by typing a keyword, and if the bar has not been created before, it is then created upon the search. The Grass Mud Horse or Cǎonímǎ (草泥马 ) is a Chinese Internet meme widely used as a form of symbolic defiance of the widespread Internet censorship in China. It is a play on the Mandarin words "cào nǐ mā" (肏你妈 ), literally, "fuck your mother", and is one of the so-called 10 mythical creatures created in a hoax article on Baidu Baike in early 2009 whose names form obscene puns. It has become an Internet chat forum cult phenomenon in China and has garnered worldwide press attention, with videos, cartoons and merchandise of the animal (which is said to resemble the alpaca), having appeared.

Although Clemens rejuvenated himself with the Blue Jays (en route to one of the best-ever single seasons by a starting pitcher, winning the Cy Young Award and the pitchers' triple crown), both Garcia and Merced ended up being flops as dismal overall hitting and an inconsistent bullpen doomed the Blue Jays once again to a last-place finish. 1997 also marked the end of the road for manager Cito Gaston, being fired near the end of the season (Gaston would eventually return to the team in 2008). Longtime fan-favourite Joe Carter also played in his final season for the Blue Jays, as he was released at the end of the season. The Florence Blue Jays were a minor league baseball team based in Florence, South Carolina. They began play in the South Atlantic League in 1981 where they captured the league title in 1985.

**Question:** Which man who presented the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was born on October 22, 1930?
**Answer:** Frank Lowy

**Context:**
Sir Frank P. Lowy, {'1': ", '2': ", '3': ", '4': "} (born 22 October 1930) is an Australian-Israeli businessman and Chairman of Westfield Corporation, a global shopping centre company with US$29.3 billion of assets under management in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. He is a former Chairman of Scentre Group, the owner and manager of Westfield-branded shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand. The Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was a bid by Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The bid has come under FBI investigation for bribery and corruption, leading to the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter. With a population of 2 million people, Qatar will be the first Arab state to host the World Cup. Russia announced its intent to bid for the FIFA World Cup in early 2009, and submitted its request to FIFA in time. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has taken a keen interest in the bid and has gone so far as ordering Vitaly Mutko, the Minister of Sports, to "prepare a bid for Russia to hold the 2018 World Cup". According to a report earlier submitted by Vitaly Mutko, who also served that time as President of the Russian Football Union (RFU), the country is ready to spend some $10 billion on the tournament. The bid committee also includes RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations. In October 2010, Russia formally pulled out of the race to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On December 2, 2010 Russia was chosen as the host country for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the first official bid from the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) to host the FIFA World Cup. FIFA rejected the bid for lack of government support on 19 March 2010. Indonesia was one of four Asian countries bidding to bring the tournament to Asia for a second time, the 2002 tournament having been played in Japan and South Korea. Indonesia, under the name of the Dutch East Indies, had been the first Asian nation to compete in the World Cup, when they participated in the 1938 event, and they lost to Hungary in the first round. The Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid is the second official bid from the Japan Football Association or the JFA. Had this bid been successful, Japan would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host South Korea, becoming the sixth nation to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil and (West) Germany. On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association Bid team decided to concentrate solely on winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups was the process by which the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selected locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups. The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition. By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included England, Russia, a joint bid from Belgium and Netherlands, and a joint bid from Portugal and Spain. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. Indonesia's bid was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons. The Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the second official bid from the Korea Football Association or the KFA. If this bid was successful, Korea would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host Japan. Despite recent tensions, Han Sung-joo, chairman of the bid committee hoped to involve North Korea if South Korea received the bid. The United States Soccer Federation submitted a bid with the hope of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. U.S. Soccer first said in February 2007 that it would put forth a bid for the 2018 World Cup. On January 28, 2009, U.S. Soccer announced that it would submit bids for both the 2018 and 2022 Cups. In October 2010 it withdrew from the 2018 bid process to focus on winning the 2022 edition. On December 2, 2010, it was announced that Qatar would be the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Bill Clinton remarked "The FIFA people were in a mood to give it to people who didn’t have it. I think they wanted to make soccer a world sport." The Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid is Morocco's bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It is competing with the North America 2026 FIFA World Cup bid, a joint bid between Canada, Mexico and the United States for hosting rights. On 11 August 2017, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced that it would submit a bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Australia submitted an unsuccessful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On 2 December 2010 FIFA announced that the event would be held in Qatar. Australia also lodged a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but withdrew the bid on 10 June 2010. The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup. The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson. However, due to controversies of Qatar hosting, Australia's bid is possible if FIFA decides to strip Qatar's 2022 hosting rights.

Born in Brundall, Norfolk, Clemmett began his acting career in 2013. He is known for being cast as Albus Potter in 2015 for the British play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. His performance in the play has made him popular with Harry Potter fans, as well as the creator of Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling. Rowling stated that, "There's much I could say about Sam-as-Albus, but we'd be into spoiler territory so quickly I'll just say we couldn't have cast better." He played the role in the West End, until late-Spring 2017.

In April 2011 worldwide sales of Harry Potter books were estimated to be about 450 million copies. Oddly enough, it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into. As best as can be determined (as of 2017), The Philosopher's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 73 other languages. A 74th language, Scots, was announced on 2017-06-28 and it is expected to be available in October, 2017. Both Bloomsbury's and J.K. Rowling's sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages (80 with the 2017-06-28 announcement of Scots); however, it has been argued that number actually represents the number of authorized translations (of The Philosopher's Stone) plus the original English. The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language. Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (5 languages). English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be (indeed, it is why our list here counts up to 74). Thus: 79 − English − 5 double-translations = 73. It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books are have been translated into these 73 languages. Christian Peter Coulson (born 3 October 1978) is an English actor best known for playing the 16 year old Tom Marvolo Riddle in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets".

A moving map display is a type of navigation system output that, instead of numerically displaying the current geographical coordinates determined by the navigation unit or an heading and distance indication of a certain waypoint, displays the unit's current location at the center of a map. As the unit moves around and new coordinates are therefore determined, the map moves to keep its position at the center of the display. Mechanical moving map displays using paper charts were first introduced in the 1950s, and became common in some roles during the 1960s. Mechanically moved paper maps were replaced by digital maps during the 1970s and 80s, with resolution and detail improving along with computer imagery and the computer memory systems that held the data. A common example of a moving map display today is the map display in a smart phone, which uses GPS to determine its current position and then recalls the map data from the device's memory or from the Internet in real time.

**Question:** What is the relationship of Yeshahework Yilma's mother to the man who was Ethiopia's emperor from 1930 to 1974? 
**Answer:** niece

**Context:**
Princess Yeshashework Yilma (died 1982) was the daughter of Dejazmatch Yilma Makonnen, governor of Harar and niece of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. Her mother Woizero Aselefech Wolde Hanna was the niece of Empress Taitu Bitul, consort of Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. Through her paternal great-grandmother, she was a member of the Imperial Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia. Her father died while she was still very young. Full Gospel Believers Church or Mulu Wongel church (in Amharic) is a Pentecostal church located in the country's capital city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The senior pastor is Wake Yilma. Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east. Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation. Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution. Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world. Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC. The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name "Ethiopia" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots). After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint ("Era of the Judges/Princes"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history. Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization. It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces. Many historians trace modern Ethiopia's foreign policy to the reign of Emperor Tewodros II, whose primary concerns were the security of Ethiopia's traditional borders, obtaining technology from Europe (or modernization), and to a lesser degree Ethiopian rights to the monastery of Dar-es-Sultan in the city of Jerusalem. Tewodros' diplomatic efforts, however, ended disastrously with the British expedition of 1868 which concluded with his death. Despite the efforts of his successor Emperor Yohannes IV to establish a relationship with the United Kingdom, Ethiopia was ignored by the world powers until the opening of the Suez Canal, and more important, the Mahdist War, drew outside attention to her once more. Mengistu Haile Mariam (Amharic: , pronounced ] ; born 21 May 1937) is an Ethiopian politician who was the leader of Ethiopia from 1977 to 1991. He was the chairman of the Derg, the Communist military junta that governed Ethiopia, from 1977 to 1987, and the President of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia from 1987 to 1991. The Derg took power in the Ethiopian Revolution following the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1974, marking the end of the Solomonic dynasty which had ruled Ethiopia since the 13th century. Mengistu purged rivals for power from the Derg and made himself Ethiopia's dictator, attempting to modernise Ethiopia's feudal economy through Marxist-inspired policies such as nationalisation and land redistribution. His bloody consolidation of power in 1977-1978 is known as the Ethiopian Red Terror, a brutal crackdown on opposition groups and civilians following a failed assassination attempt by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party in September 1976, after they had ignored the Derg's invitation to join the union of socialist parties. Italians of Ethiopia are the emigrants and colonists from Italy who moved to live in Ethiopia as far back as the 19th century, and their descendants. King Menelik II did not allow the sale of lands belonging to Ethiopia to Italians (Eritrea) and probably allowed France (Djibouti) to solidify his centralized power and have external trading partners. There was a subsequent exchange of ideas, farming techniques, education and technology between the Italians and Ethiopians during most of this period, including transportation—most notably the Italian engineers who helped to architect an build the aqueducts and rail system for Ethiopia's railway system from the new capital, Addis Ababa to then French controlled Djibouti port. However, the relationship was often marked by the fact that under various treaties written in both Amharic and Italian, the Italian version always referred to Ethiopia as a protectorate of Italy. Most of the Italians moved to Ethiopia after the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1936. Haile Selassie I (Ge'ez: , "qädamawi haylä səllasé" ; ] ; 23 July 1892 – 27 August 1975) , born Tafari Makonnen Woldemikael, was Ethiopia's regent from 1916 to 1930 and emperor from 1930 to 1974. He also served as Chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity from 25 May 1963 to 17 July 1964 and 5 November 1966 to 11 September 1967. He was a member of the Solomonic Dynasty. Aba Tenna Dejazmach Yilma International Airport (Ge'ez: አባ ጤና ደጃዝማች ይልማ ዓለም አቀፍ የአየር ማረፊያ "ābbā ṭēnā dejāzmāč yilmā ʿālem aqef ye-āyyer mārefīyā") (IATA: DIR, ICAO: HADR) , also known as Dire Dawa International Airport, is an international airport serving Dire Dawa, a city in eastern Ethiopia. It is located 5 km northwest of the city center. Lij Endelkachew Makonnen (September 8, 1927 – November 23, 1974) was an Ethiopian politician. Born in Addis Ababa, his father, Ras Betwoded Makonnen Endelkachew, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia in the 1950s. Endelkachew Makonnen was a member of the aristocratic Addisge clan that were very influential in the later part of the Ethiopian monarchy. He would be the last Imperial Prime Minister appointed by Emperor Haile Selassie. He was a stepson of Princess Yeshashework Yilma, Emperor Haile Selassie's only niece. Survivor Africa: Panama was the first pan-regional season of the television show "Survivor" to air in central or southern Africa and it included contestants from the countries of Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The show was broadcast on the channel M-net from September 3, 2006, to November 19, 2006, during which time twelve episodes aired. The contestants for this season were initially split into two tribes, the Embera tribe, named after Panama's semi-nomadic and heavily body-painted tribe, whose buffs were blue, and the Kuna tribe, named after a traditionally matriarchal and politically organised people of Panama, whose buffs were red. During the pre-merge portion of the program the Embera tribe dominated as they won the majority of both the reward and immunity challenges while Kuna saw their numbers dwindle from six to three. When the tribes merged into the Nagual tribe their buff colors may have changed to yellow, but their original tribal alliances remained and the former members of Embera quickly voted out Yagazie "Yaga" Chuwumerje and Nana Sarpong, leaving Metasebia "Meti" Yilma as the only former Kuna member left in the game. Following the elimination of Nana, Tsholofelo "Tebby" Gasenelwe approached Meti and Olanike "Nike" Gbolahan about forming an all-girl alliance. Once formed, the girl alliance, along with Jeremiah Zulu, voted out both Leonard Mapuranga and the leader of the former Embera alliance, Derrick Assetto. When it came time for the final four, the contestants competed in two challenges in order to determine the final two. The first of these challenges was the "plank" challenge. As Meti was the first person to fall off the plank, she was eliminated from the game. As Tebby was the last person to fall off the plank, she automatically advanced to the final two. The other two contestants competed in a second challenge which Jeremiah won and advanced to the final two while Nike was eliminated. Ultimately, it was Gasenelwe from Botswana who won this season over Jeremiah Zulu with a jury vote of 6–0.

**Question:** The Simpsons episode that aired on February 19, 2012 entitled "At Long Last Leave" represented what milestone for the show? 
**Answer:** show's 500th episode

**Context:**
"Good Night" (also known as "Good Night Simpsons") is the first of forty-eight Simpsons shorts that appeared on the variety show "The Tracey Ullman Show". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 19, 1987, during the third episode of "The Tracey Ullman Show" and marks the first appearance of the Simpson family — Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie — on television. After three seasons on Tracey Ullman, the shorts would be adapted into the animated show "The Simpsons". "Good Night" has since been aired on the show in the episode "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular" (in its entirety), along with several other Ullman shorts, and is one of the few shorts to ever be released on DVD, being included in the Season 1 DVD set. "At Long Last Leave" is the fourteenth episode of "The Simpsons"' twenty-third season, and the 500th episode overall of the series. In the episode, the Simpsons discover that the inhabitants of Springfield have grown tired of them and have secretly decided to throw them out of the city. After being evicted from Springfield, the family members end up in a rugged place without rules and regulations called The Outlands. There, they briefly come across their neighbor Julian Assange, who created WikiLeaks. Assange, who is in fear of extradition to Sweden and then the United States, guest-starred in the episode as himself and recorded his lines over the phone having been granted asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in Britain, while waiting for the results of "Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority". "You Kent Always Say What You Want", formerly known as "Kent State Massacre", is the twenty-second episode of "The Simpsons"<nowiki>'</nowiki> eighteenth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 20, 2007 as part of the one-hour season finale, alongside the episode "24 Minutes"; a repeat took place on August 19, 2007. It was the milestone 400th episode of "The Simpsons" and was written by Tim Long. The episode guest starred Ludacris as himself and Maurice LaMarche as the Fox announcer. It was the last episode to air prior to "The Simpsons Movie" releasing into theaters on July 27, 2007. "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" is the fourteenth episode in the eighth season of the American animated television series "The Simpsons". It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 9, 1997. In the episode, "The Itchy & Scratchy Show" attempts to regain viewers by introducing a new character named Poochie, whose voice is provided by Homer. The episode is largely self-referential and satirizes the world of television production, fans of "The Simpsons", and the series itself. It was written by David X. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore. Alex Rocco is a credited guest voice as Roger Meyers, Jr. for the third and final time (having previously provided the character's voice in "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" and "The Day the Violence Died"); Phil Hartman also guest stars as Troy McClure. Poochie would become a minor recurring character and Comic Book Guy's catchphrase, "Worst episode ever", is introduced in this episode. With "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", the show's 167th episode, "The Simpsons" surpassed "The Flintstones" in the number of episodes produced for a prime-time animated series. "Little Orphan Millie" is the sixth episode of "The Simpsons"<nowiki>'</nowiki> nineteenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2007.

"A Star Is Born Again" is the 13th episode from "The Simpsons"<nowiki>'</nowiki> fourteenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 2, 2003. The episode owes much of its plot to "Notting Hill" (1999). While that film is about an actress (Julia Roberts) finding happiness with the owner of an independent bookstore, the Simpsons episode features Hollywood movie star Sara Sloane (Marisa Tomei) falling for Ned Flanders after visiting the Leftorium. Patty and Selma Bouvier ( ) are fictional characters in the American animated sitcom "The Simpsons". They are identical twins (but with different hairstyles) and are both voiced by Julie Kavner. They are Marge Simpson's older twin sisters, who both work at the Springfield Department of Motor Vehicles, and possess a strong dislike for their brother-in-law, Homer Simpson. Selma is the elder by two minutes, and longs for male companionship while her sister, Patty, is a lesbian. Kavner voices them as characters who "suck the life out of everything". Patty and Selma first appeared on the first ever aired Simpsons episode "Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire", which aired on December 17, 1989. "The Simpsons"' twenty-third season began airing on Fox on September 25, 2011, and ended May 20, 2012. The showrunner for the season was Al Jean, with three episodes ran with Matt Selman, one of those he also wrote himself. The show's 500th episode, "At Long Last Leave", aired February 19, 2012. The following is a list of comic book series based on the animated TV show The Simpsons and published by Bongo Comics in the United States. The first comic strips based on "The Simpsons" appeared in 1991 in the magazine "Simpsons Illustrated" (not to be confused with the comic publications from 2012 bearing the same name), which was a companion magazine to the show. The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book entitled "Simpsons Comics and Stories", containing three different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. The book was a success and due to this, the creator of "The Simpsons", Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison, Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics. By the end of 1993, Bongo was publishing four titles: "Simpsons Comics", "Bartman", "Radioactive Man" and "Itchy & Scratchy Comics". Since then, many more titles have been published, out of which "Simpsons Comics", "Bart Simpson", "Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror", "Simpsons Super Spectacular", Simpsons Summer Shindig, and "Simpsons Winter Wingding". "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular" is the tenth episode of "The Simpsons"<nowiki>'</nowiki> seventh season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 3, 1995. As the title suggests, it is the 138th episode and the third clip show episode of "The Simpsons", after "" and "Another Simpsons Clip Show". While the "138th Episode Spectacular" compiles sequences from episodes throughout the entire series like the previous two, it also shows clips from the original Simpsons shorts from "The Tracey Ullman Show" and other previously unaired material. Like the Halloween specials, the episode is considered non-canon and falls outside of the show's regular continuity.

**Question:** Which ocean would the ingredients likely come from for the She-crab soup?
**Answer:** Atlantic Ocean

**Context:**
She-crab soup is a rich soup, similar to bisque, made of milk or heavy cream, crab or fish stock, Atlantic blue crab meat, and (traditionally) crab roe, and a small amount of dry sherry added as it is plated. It may be thickened either by heat reduction or with a purée of boiled rice; it may also include such seasonings as mace and shallots or onions. The soup is a regional specialty from Tidewater, Virginia, the South Carolina Lowcountry and Georgia coast. It is commonly featured on the menus of many Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia restaurants. This extinct genus of dinocephalian therapsid lived approximately 267-260 million years ago during the middle Permian period of the Paleozoic era. These reptiles, located in Russia were initially believed to be mammals. Syodon was first named by Stephan Kutorga in 1838. The fossils of these Synapsids were first discovered in the Molotov Province region of Russia in limestone beds with a high content of copper. However, scientists believe that these organisms likely come from higher rock beds due to increased specializations in their morphology. Avocado soup is a fruit soup prepared using avocados as a primary ingredient. Ingredients used in its preparation in addition to ripe avocados can include milk, cream, half-and-half or buttermilk, soup stock or broth, water, lime juice, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Spring soup is a soup made with ingredients that are only in season for a short period during spring. Although asparagus largely characterizes spring soup, spring soup may include just about any spring vegetable added to a broth, chowder, or bisque. Spring soup is popular largely because it includes fresh ingredients not seen for a while by the consumer. Watercress soup is a soup prepared using the leaf vegetable watercress as a primary ingredient. It may be prepared as a cream soup or as a broth/stock-based soup using vegetable or chicken stock. Additional ingredients used can include vegetables such as potato, leeks, spinach, celery and turnips, cheese, butter, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Simulations indicate that it has most likely come from the Oort cloud, with a roughly equal probability of being an extinct comet and a rocky body that was originally scattered into the Oort cloud. The discovery of 1996 PW prompted theoretical research that suggests that roughly 1 to 2 percent of the Oort cloud objects are rocky. Peanut soup or groundnut soup is a soup made from peanuts, often with various other ingredients. It is a staple of African cuisine but is also eaten in East Asia (Taiwan), the United States (mainly in Virginia) and other areas around the world. In Ghana it is often eaten with fufu.

The Tidewater region is a geographic area of southeast Virginia and northeastern North Carolina, part of the Atlantic coastal plain in the United States of America. Portions of Maryland facing the Chesapeake Bay are also given this designation. The area gains its name because of the effects of the changing tides on local rivers, sounds, and the ocean. The area is generally flat and low and composed of tidal marsh and large expanses of swamp. Much of the area is covered with pocosin and the higher areas are used for agricultural farmlands. Geographically, in North Carolina and Virginia the Tidewater area is the land between the Suffolk Scarp and the Atlantic Ocean. The Hampton Roads area of Virginia is considered to be in the Tidewater. Extreme Southern Maryland and parts of the lower Eastern Shore round out the northern fringe of the region on the Chesapeake Bay.

**Answer:** "The Dragon"

**Context:**
Sabine Thalbach (1932–1966) was a German actress who appeared in many East German films. She was married to the director Benno Besson, and was the mother of the actress Katharina Thalbach. Trumpets and Drums (German: "Pauken und Trompeten" ) is an adaptation of an 18th-century English Restoration comedy by Farquhar, "The Recruiting Officer". It was written by the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht in collaboration with Benno Besson and Elisabeth Hauptmann. The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (French: Jeanne d'Arc ) is a 1999 French epic historical drama film directed by Luc Besson.

**Question:** Psycho-physical Awareness was developed into an original and dependable method by a Russian-American actor who was referred to by Konstantin Stanislavski as what?
**Answer:** his most brilliant student

**Context:**
François Alexandre Nicolas Chéri Delsarte (19 November 1811 – 20 July 1871) was a French musician and teacher. Though he achieved some success as a composer, he is chiefly known as a teacher in singing and declamation. He went on to develop an acting style that attempted to connect the inner emotional experience of the actor with a systematized set of gestures and movements based upon his own observations of human interaction. This Delsarte method (also known as the Delsarte system) became so popular that it was taught throughout the world, particularly in America, by many teachers who did not fully understand or communicate the emotional connections behind the gestures, and as a result the method devolved into melodramatic posing, the kind in response to which Konstantin Stanislavski would later develop his inner psychological methods. The "art of representation" (Russian: "predstavlenie" ) is a critical term used by the seminal Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski to describe a method of acting. It comes from his acting manual "An Actor Prepares" (1936). Stanislavski defines his own approach to acting as "experiencing the role" and contrasts it with the "art of representation". It is on the basis of this formulation that the American Method acting teacher Uta Hagen defines her recommended Stanislavskian approach as 'presentational' acting, as opposed to 'representational' acting. This use, however, directly contradicts mainstream critical use of these terms. Despite the distinction, Stanislavskian theatre, in which actors 'experience' their roles, remains 'representational' in the broader critical sense. An Actor Prepares (Russian: "Работа актера над собой" ) is the first of Konstantin Stanislavski's books on acting, followed by "Building a Character" and "Creating a Role". Stanislavski intended to publish the contents of "An Actor Prepares" and "Building a Character" as a single volume, and in the Russian language. However, "An Actor Prepares" was first published as a single volume in English, and World War II delayed the publication of "Building a Character" for more than ten years. Mikhail Aleksandrovich "Michael" Chekhov (Russian: Михаил Александрович Чехов , 29 August 1891 – 30 September 1955) was a Russian-American actor, director, author, and theatre practitioner. His acting technique has been used by actors such as Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood, Marilyn Monroe, and Yul Brynner. Konstantin Stanislavski referred to him as his most brilliant student. He was a nephew of the playwright Anton Chekhov. Stanislavski's system is a systematic approach to training actors that the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski developed in the first half of the 20th century. Stanislavski was the first in the West to propose that actor training should involve something more than merely physical and vocal training. His system cultivates what he calls the "art of experiencing" (with which he contrasts the "art of representation"). It mobilises the actor's conscious thought and will in order to activate other, less-controllable psychological processes—such as emotional experience and subconscious behaviour—sympathetically and indirectly. In rehearsal, the actor searches for inner motives to justify action and the definition of what the character seeks to achieve at any given moment (a "task"). Psycho-physical Awareness is a popular acting technique used in many schools and universities in the U.S. and Europe. This technique works on the relationship between the mind and the body and at developing an actor’s conscious awareness. In other words, recognizing the resulting sensory and mental states in reaction to physical stimuli. The pioneer of this technique is Constantin Stanislavski who sought to overcome the divisions between “mind from body, knowledge from feeling, analysis from action” through psychophysical training or the method of physical action, but it was Michael Chekhov who further developed an original and dependable method of what we now know to be psycho-physical awareness. Method acting is a range of training and rehearsal techniques that seek to encourage sincere and emotionally expressive performances, as formulated by a number of different theatre practitioners, principally in the United States, where it is among the most popular—and controversial—approaches to acting. These techniques are built on the Stanislavski's "system" of the Russian actor and director Konstantin Stanislavski. Though many have contributed to the development of the Method, three teachers are associated with "having set the standard of its success", though each emphasized different aspects of the approach: Lee Strasberg (the psychological aspects), Stella Adler (the sociological aspects), and Sanford Meisner (the behavioral aspects). The approach was first developed when they worked together at the Group Theatre in New York. All three subsequently claimed to be the rightful heirs of Stanislavski's approach. His three major books were "An Actor Prepares", "Building a Character", and "Creating a Role". Psychotechnique forms part of the 'system' of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal developed by the Russian theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski. It describes the inner, psychological elements of training that support what he called "experiencing" a role in performance. In a rehearsal process, psychotechnique is interrelated with the "embodiment" of the role, in order to achieve a fully realised characterisation. Stanislavski describes the elements of psychotechnique in the first part of his manual "An Actor's Work". Officially State Russian Drama Theatre named after Konstantin Stanislavski (Armenian: Կոնստանտին Ստանիսլավսկու անվան ռուսական պետական դրամատիկական թատրոն ), more commonly Stanislavski Russian Theatre, is a state theatre in the Armenian capital of Yerevan located on Abovyan Street in the central Kentron district of the city, next to Charles Aznavour Square. It was opened in 1937 and named after the Russian actor and theatre director Constantin Stanislavski since 1938. The theatre director is Alexander Grigoryan since 1965. Konstantin Sergeievich Stanislavski ("né" Alexeiev; Russian: Константи́н Серге́евич Станисла́вский ; 17 January [O.S. 5 January] 1863 7 August 1938) was a seminal Russian theatre practitioner. He was widely recognised as an outstanding character actor and the many productions that he directed garnered a reputation as one of the leading theatre directors of his generation. His principal fame and influence, however, rests on his 'system' of actor training, preparation, and rehearsal technique. Calling him "the first great creator of a method of acting in the theatre," Jerzy Grotowski praised Stanislavski for "asking all the relevant questions that could be asked about theatrical technique." Stanislavski began developing a 'grammar' of acting in 1906; his initial choice to call it his System struck him as too dogmatic, so he wrote it as his 'system' (without the capital letter and in inverted commas) to indicate the provisional nature of the results of his investigations—modern scholarship and the standard edition of Stanislavski's works follow that practice; see Benedetti (1999a, 169), Gauss (1999, 3—4), Milling and Ley (2001, 1), and Stanislavski (1938) and (1957). </ref>

**Question:** How many European Jews died in the catastrophe of which Eva Hayman is a survivor?
**Answer:** six million

**Context:**
Eva Hayman (born 1924 in Czechoslovakia) was a Holocaust survivor. When she was only 15, she was sent on a train to Britain with her sister Vera as part of the kindertransport movement, which saved many Jewish children and was organized by Nicholas Winton. Hayman said that her childhood ended the day she boarded the train and she saw children that were torn out of their parents arms. Many older siblings had to become a parent to their younger sisters or brothers. Eva and Vera spent most of the war in Liverpool, Hastings, Monmouth, and Poole. It eventually became impossible to write letters to their parents, so Hayman began writing a diary that was later published as a book called "By the Moon and the Stars". Maurycy Gottlieb made significant contributions towards creating the genre of Jewish Art. Gottlieb’s 1878 painting "Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur" exemplifies many artistic values that are significant to Eastern European Jews at the time and contains many deeper meanings about Gottlieb’s short life. The religious holiday of Yom Kippur (the holiest day of the Jewish year) is shown throughout this piece by the figures and symbolism. The color palette, location, human beings, and objects used all suggest a holiday of repentance and of importance. In this research paper, I will formally analyze the painting Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur, examine the context of the painting and how Gottlieb’s Jewish upbringing influences this work of art. While earlier Jewish immigrants from Germany tended to be politically conservative, the wave of Eastern European Jews, starting in the early 1880s, were generally more liberal or left-wing, and became the political majority. Many of the latter came to America with experience in the socialist, anarchist, and communist movements as well as the Labor Bund, emanating from Eastern Europe. Many Jews rose to leadership positions in the early 20th century American labor movement, and helped to found unions that played a major role in left-wing politics and, after 1936, in Democratic Party politics. For most of the 20th century since 1936, the vast majority of Jews in the United States have been aligned with the Democratic Party. Towards the end of the 20th century, and at the beginning of the 21st century, Republicans have launched initiatives to woo American Jews away from the Democratic Party. Jewish emancipation was the external (and internal) process in various nations in Europe of eliminating Jewish disabilities, e.g. Jewish quotas, to which Jewish people were then subject, and the recognition of Jews as entitled to equality and citizenship rights on a communal, not merely individual, basis. It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Jewish emancipation followed the Age of Enlightenment and the concurrent Jewish enlightenment. Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against Jews where they resided. Before the emancipation, most Jews were isolated in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve integration in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European civil society as Jews gained full citizenship. They emigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the Russian Empire and France. Some European Jews turned to Socialism, others to Jewish nationalism: Zionism. The Holocaust, also referred to as the Shoah, was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its World War II collaborators killed some six million European Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and constituted about two-thirds of the nine million Jews in Continental Europe. A broader definition of the Holocaust includes non-Jewish victims such as the Roma, ethnic Poles, other Slavic ethnic groups, and the disabled and mentally ill. An even broader definition includes Soviet citizens and prisoners of war, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, black people, and political opponents of the Nazis. In 1941–1942 during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, there were at least 2,173 Jews in Norway. At least 775 of them were arrested, detained and/or deported. More than half of the Norwegians who died in camps in Germany were Jews. 742 Jews were murdered in the camps and 23 Jews died as a result of extrajudicial execution, murder and suicide during the war, bringing the total of Jewish Norwegian dead to at least 765 Jews, comprising 230 complete households. "Nearly two-thirds of the Jews in Norway fled from Norway". Of these, around 900 Jews were smuggled out of the country by the Norwegian resistance movement, mostly to Sweden but some also to the United Kingdom). Between 28 and 34 of those deported survived their continued imprisonment in camps (following their deportation)—and around 25 (of these) returned to Norway after the war. Jewish ghettos in Europe were parts of a number of cities in Europe in which Jews were permitted to live. In addition to being confined to ghettos, Jews were placed under strict regulations and disabilities in many European cities. The character of ghettos varied over times. In some cases, they comprised a Jewish quarter, the area of a city traditionally inhabited by Jews. In many instances, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos had narrow streets and small, crowded houses. Residents had their own justice system. Around the ghetto stood walls that, during pogroms, were closed from inside to protect the community, but from the outside during Christmas, Pesach, and Easter Week to prevent the Jews from leaving at those times. The Holocaust in France refers to the persecution, deportation, and annihilation of Jews and Roma between 1940 and 1944 in occupied France, metropolitan Vichy, and in Vichy-North Africa, during World War II. The persecution began in 1940, and culminated in deportations of Jews from France to death camps in Germany and Nazi-occupied Poland from 1942 which lasted until July 1944. Of the 340,000 Jews living in metropolitan/continental France in 1940, more than 75,000 were deported to death camps, where about 72,500 were killed. French Vichy government and the French police participated in the roundup of Jews. Although most deported Jews died, the survival rate of the Jewish population in France was up to 75% which is one of the highest survival rates in Europe. Moses Elias Levy (1782 in Mogador, Morocco – September 7, 1854 in White Sulphur Springs, Virginia) was a Jewish-American businessman and a social and religious reformer. He was unusual for the fact that he was a slaveholder as well as an advocate for the gradual emancipation of slaves. Levy wrote "A Plan for the Abolition of Slavery" in London in 1828, achieving celebrity at the height of the antislavery campaign. In the United States, Levy eventually purchased 50,000 acres in north-central Florida where he established Pilgrimage Plantation, a refuge for persecuted European Jews, and was also one of the founders of the town of Micanopy. Levy is frequently noted as the father of U.S. Senator David Levy Yulee. Pilgrimage Plantation, the first communitarian refuge for displaced European Jews in America was destroyed by Seminole forces in 1835 during the onset of the Second Seminole War. The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939–1945 is the second volume of Saul Friedländer's history of Nazi Germany and the Jews. It describes the German extermination policies that resulted in the murder of six million European Jews. The book presents a detailed history of the Holocaust and is based on a vast array of documents and memoirs. It won the 2007 Leipzig Book Fair Prize for Non-fiction and won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 2008.

**Question:** Trilochanapala, last king of the Kabul Shahi dynasty, ruled in the site of which modern country?
**Answer:** Afghanistan

**Context:**
Anandapala or Anantpala was the third and last ruler of the Kabul Shahi dynasty in Afghanistan and Pakistan. His reign began in 1001 CE and ended in or about 1010. He was the son of Jayapala, whose kingdom used to stretch from Laghman to Kashmir and Sirhind to Multan, with Peshawar being in the center, but had lost most of his territories to Sabuktagin and his son Mahmud. Anandapala and his confederacy was defeated by Mahmud of Ghazni when his elephant suddenly took flight and turned the tide of the battle. The Turk Shahi were a Turkic dynasty that ruled from Kabul and Kapisa in the 7th to 9th centuries. The heartland of their domain was Kabulistan, and at times included Zabulistan and Gandhara. The Turk Shahi replaced the Hunic dynasty of the Nezak. During their rule, they were the bulwark against the eastward expansion of the Abbasid Caliphate. The last Turkic ruler of Kabul, Lagaturman, was deposed by his Brahman c. 850, signaling the end of the Buddhist Turk Shahi dynasty, and the beginning of the Hindu Shahi dynasty of Kabul. In January 1687, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb led his forces to besiege the Qutb Shahi dynasty at Golconda Fort (also known as the "Diamond Capital" and the only source of diamonds at that time) and was home to the Kollur Mine. The ruler of Golconda was Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. Aurangzeb and the Mughal army had successfully conquered two Muslim kingdoms: Nizams of Ahmednagar and the Adilshahis of Bijapur. It was only a matter of time that the Mughal army arrived at Golconda Fort. The siege of Golconda lasted 8 months and on various occasions, it had pushed the massive Mughal army to its limits, in fact, the Golconda Fort was probably the most impregnable fort in South Asia. Aurangzeb and the Mughals entered Golconda through a decisive victory but through the secret treachery of Sarandaz Khan, a military official in the army of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, who was bribed to open one gate and let the Mughals enter the fort. This battle was important for both sides, because of the place being the only source of diamonds,the fort had good defenses, having spikes on the front gate to defend themselves for the Mughal elephants,and also having corners where the walls were cut like diamonds, and whenever a guard could spot any intrusion, he would clap and the sound of his clapping would echo above and below to alert other guards instantly.

**Question:** The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 expanded a publicly available or private database?
**Answer:** publicly available

**Context:**
Planning Policy Statement 23: Planning and Pollution Control commonly abbreviated as PPS 23, is a document produced by the British Government and intended to complement the new pollution control framework under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 and the PPC Regulations 2000. The current version was introduced in November 2004 and replaced Revised PPG 23: Planning and Pollution Control (published 1994). The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India is a statutory organisation under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). It was established in 1974 under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. CPCB is also entrusted with the powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. It serves as a field formation and also provides technical services to the Ministry of Environment and Forests under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. It Co-ordinates the activities of the State Pollution Control Boards by providing technical assistance and guidance and also resolves disputes among them. It is the apex organisation in country in the field of pollution control, as a technical wing of MoEF. The board is led by its chairman, who is nominated by the Central Government. The current acting chairman is "Shri S.P. Singh Parihar IAS ". Since its establishment in May 2006, the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE), a registered non-profit organization based in Beijing, China, has developed the China Pollution Map Database to monitor corporate environmental performance, pinpoint geographical locations of pollution sources and to act as an informational platform on regional pollution status, such as water and air quality, and pollutant discharge rankings. This publicly available information resource brings together over 97,000 environmental supervision records from government departments, at all levels and regions, throughout mainland China. These records, dating back as far as 2004, allow for the expansion of environmental information disclosure, enabling communities to fully understand the hazards and risks in the surrounding environment, thus promoting widespread public participation in environmental governance. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a publicly available database containing information on toxic chemical releases and other waste management activities in the United States. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 is an Act of the Parliament of Canada, whose goal is to contribute to sustainable development through pollution prevention and to protect the environment, human life and health from the risks associated with toxic substances. It covers a diversity of activities that can affect human health and the environment, and acts to address any pollution issues not covered by other federal laws. As such, CEPA 1999 is a "catch all" piece of legislation that ensures potentially toxic substances are not inadvertently exempt from federal oversight as a result of unforeseen legislative loopholes. The Fires Prevention Act 1838 (1 & 2 Vict c 75) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It amended the provisions of the Fires Prevention Act 1785, which related to manufactories of tar, pitch and turpentine, by enacting that the penalty of £100 inflicted to the owners or occupiers of such buildings by that Act would only be applied when the building was within 75 feet of another building. If the adjacent building was occupied by the same tenant, and the whole premises were more than 75 feet from any other building, the penalty would not apply. It also established that no person would be liable for any penalties under that Act until January 1839, with proprietors or occupiers of such buildings remaining exempt until August 1840. John Phillip Feldmeier is an attorney with the Cincinnati, Ohio law firm of Sirkin, Kinsley, & Nazzarine (a spin-off of the now-dissolved Sirkin, Pinales, & Schwartz LLP), where he practices in the areas of criminal defense and first amendment litigation. He served as co-counsel for the Free Speech Coalition, along with H. Louis Sirkin and Laura A. Abrams, in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, in which the United States Supreme Court struck down the "appears to be a minor" and "conveys the impression of a minor" provisions of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996. Feldmeier represented Beth Lewis in the Ohio Supreme Court case concerning attorney–client privilege in connection to the Erica Baker missing child investigation. In 2003, he testified before the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security regarding the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention Act of 2003, part of the PROTECT Act of 2003. In 2007, Feldmeier authored a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Free Speech Coalition in the U.S. v Williams case, the contents of which were the subject of much of the focus of the opinions of both the majority and dissent. The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA) in the United States created a national policy to have pollution prevented or reduced at the source wherever possible. It also expanded the Toxics Release Inventory. The Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act (1970, R.S.C. 1985) is a Government of Canada statute to prevent pollution of areas of the arctic waters adjacent to the mainland and islands of the Canadian arctic. The federal departments responsible for enforcing this Act is Natural Resources Canada, Transport Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. Pollution prevention reduces the amount of pollution generated by industry, agriculture, or consumers. In contrast to most pollution control strategies,which seek to manage a pollutant after it is emitted and reduce its impact upon the environment, the pollution prevention approach seeks to increase the efficiency of a process, the reducing the amount of pollution generated at its source. Although there is wide agreement that source reduction is the preferred strategy, some professionals also use the term pollution prevention.

**Question:** How many Academy Awards has the writer for the music of The Road to Hong Kong won?
**Answer:** four

**Context:**
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People’s Republic of China is a destination and transit territory for men and women trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Hong Kong is primarily a transit point for illegal migrants, some of whom are subject to conditions of debt bondage, sexual exploitation, and forced labor. To a lesser extent, Hong Kong is a destination for women from the Chinese mainland and Southeast Asia who travel to Hong Kong voluntarily for legal employment in restaurants, bars, and hotels, but upon arrival are coerced into prostitution under conditions of debt bondage. Some of the women in Hong Kong’s commercial sex trade are believed to be trafficking victims. Although Hong Kong continues efforts to regulate the thousands of foreign domestic workers from the Philippines and Indonesia currently working in Hong Kong, there appears to be a growing number of Indonesian workers who are subject to exploitation and conditions of involuntary servitude. Many Indonesian domestic workers earning the minimum wage are required to repay to their Indonesian recruitment agency $2,700 within their first seven months of employment, amounting to roughly 90 percent of a worker’s monthly salary. Such high levels of indebtedness assumed as part of the terms of employment can lead to situations of debt bondage, when unlawfully exploited by recruiters or employers. Additionally, the confiscation of passports by some Hong Kong employment agencies restricts the ability of migrant workers to leave their employer in cases of abuse, and places them under further control of their employment agency, leaving them vulnerable to trafficking. Fruit Chan Gor (; born 15 April 1959) is an independent Hong Kong Second Wave screenwriter, filmmaker and producer, who is best known for his style of film reflecting the everyday life of Hong Kong people. He is well known for using amateur actors (such as Sam Lee in "Made in Hong Kong", Wong Yau-Nam in "Hollywood Hong Kong") in his films. His name became familiar to many Hong Kongers only after the success of the 1997 film "Made in Hong Kong", which earned many local and international awards. Chan was deeply influenced by the era of sixties film in Japan, for the reason that they were not afraid to produce realistic movies that addressed society's problems. In particular, Nagisa Oshima, a Japanese director during the sixties was someone who Chan looked up to and thought of when directing Made in Hong Kong. Port of Call is a 2015 Hong Kong crime thriller film written, edited and directed by Philip Yung and starring Aaron Kwok, Elaine Jin and Patrick Tam. The film is based on a real murder case where a dismembered corpse of a murdered 16-year-old female prostitute was found in Hong Kong in 2008. "Port of Call" was the closing film at the 39th Hong Kong International Film Festival on 6 April 2015. The film was theatrically released in Hong Kong on 3 December 2015. It was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards but it was not nominated. Made in Hong Kong (香港製造) is a 1997 Hong Kong drama film written and directed by Fruit Chan, executive produced and produced by Andy Lau and starring Sam Lee, Yim Hui-Chi, Wenders Li, and Tam Ka-Chuen. It won the Best Picture Award at the 1998 Hong Kong Film Awards along with 13 other wins and 6 nominations. The film was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Bonham Road (, also 般含道) is a road in Mid-Levels, Hong Kong Island in Hong Kong. The road is a main road connecting Pokfulam Road in the west, near the University of Hong Kong, and Caine Road in the east, at the junction with Hospital Road and Seymour Road. It was named after Sir George Bonham, the third Governor of Hong Kong. It was renamed Nishi-Taisho Dori (西大正通) during Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917 was one of the principal constitutional instruments of Hong Kong when it was a British Crown colony and dependent territory; the other principal constitutional instruments were the Hong Kong Letters Patent 1917, the Hong Kong Letters Patent 1960, the Hong Kong Letters Patent 1982, and the Hong Kong Letters Patent 1991 (No. 1). The Hong Kong Royal Instructions 1917 has been amended many times since its coming into force by instruments titled 'Hong Kong Additional Instructions [year]'. Painted Faces is a 1988 Hong Kong drama film written and directed by Alex Law and starring Sammo Hung as his mentor, Master Yu Jim-yuen, of the China Drama Academy. For his portrayal as Master Yu, Hung won his second Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor at the 8th Hong Kong Film Awards. The film was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 62nd Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee. Youth in Hong Kong, according to the University of Hong Kong Statistical Profile, includes citizens of the Chinese territory of Hong Kong aged 15–24 years. As of 2011, youth in Hong Kong ages 15–24 made up 12.4% of Hong Kong's overall population at 875,200 people. Hong Kong is a hybrid culture, influenced by China and Britain, but overall by its international economic ties, which plays a role in shaping the lives of the youth in Hong Kong. The youth in Hong Kong are unique in the fact that many are living Transnationalist identities. The demographics are not just ethnically Chinese youth in Hong Kong, but also youth that are ethnically White, Indonesian, Filipino, which can be seen in Demographics of Hong Kong, and that creates a unique society. "Although with a dominant Chinese population, Hong Kong is an international city and is a mix of East and West rich in cultures, history, and religions." The disparity between the rich and poor within Hong Kong has been growing wider.

"Both Sides, Now" is a song by Joni Mitchell, and one of her best-known songs. First recorded by Judy Collins in 1967, it subsequently appeared on Mitchell's 1969 album "Clouds". She re-recorded the song in a lusher, orchestrated version for her 2000 album "Both Sides Now"; this version was subsequently featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 film "Love Actually" and was performed by Sara Bareilles during the 89th Academy Awards' "In Memoriam" homage.

"She was a good friend, and I was fortunate enough to be around her when she was working on For the Roses and Court and Spark. We were just part of each other's lives for a while. I definitely envied that part of her work -- the idea that this is just a conversation you're listening in on. It can still be poetry, but not self-conscious or forced poetry. I got extremely under her spell as a writer -- I still am. I used to go to the studio and listen to her record, sit quietly in the back of the control room. After the Beatles, Joni was the next big blip on my radar screen, in terms of, 'Hey, pay attention: this girl is doing something a little bit different.'" Mitchell's longtime engineer Henry Lewy also did some engineering work for Letters as well.

This album offered Joni's second recording of "Let There Be Love," which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution. Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas. "Let There Be Love" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953. In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album. For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released. That was "I Need You Now," which was to have followed the hit "My Love, My Love" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's. M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1. For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get "You're My Everything" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play. So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled. In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release. Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller. Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order. Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, "Bossa Nova Style", Joni included new recordings of several songs from "Let There Be Love", including a new single of "You're Nearer." That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's protégé Chuck Sagle. This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases.

**Question:** When the two Coldplay songs U.F.O and Princess of China were written, what factor did they have in common?
**Answer:** was written by all four members of the band

**Context:**
"Life in Technicolor II" (properly spelled and written as "Life in Technicolor ii"), is a song by British rock band Coldplay and the first single from the band's 2008 EP, "Prospekt's March". The song is the full, vocal version of the instrumental song "Life in Technicolor" from Coldplay's fourth studio album, "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends". A promo CD single for the song was released in December 2008. The official single was released on 2 February 2009 on 7" vinyl and digital download. The single includes the previously unreleased and unheard track "The Goldrush", one of the few Coldplay songs featuring lead vocals by drummer Will Champion. It was nominated for two Grammy Award for the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards; "Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal" and "Best Music Video". "Viva la Vida" ( ; ] ) is a song by the British rock band Coldplay. It was written by all members of the band for their fourth album, "Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends" (2008), and was released as the second single from the album. On the album, this song segues directly into the next track, "Violet Hill". "Viva la Vida" is Spanish for "Long Live Life" or "Live (the) Life". It is recognized as one of Coldplay's signature songs. In mathematics, the theory of fiber bundles with a structure group formula_1 (a topological group) allows an operation of creating an associated bundle, in which the typical fiber of a bundle changes from formula_2 to formula_3, which are both topological spaces with a group action of formula_1. For a fibre bundle "F" with structure group "G", the transition functions of the fibre (i.e., the cocycle) in an overlap of two coordinate systems "U" and "U" are given as a "G"-valued function "g" on "U"∩"U". One may then construct a fibre bundle "F"′ as a new fibre bundle having the same transition functions, but possibly a different fibre. In computer science, the shortest common supersequence of two sequences X and Y is the shortest sequence which has X and Y as subsequences. This is a problem closely related to the longest common subsequence problem. Given two sequences X = < x.. . ,x > and Y = < y.. . ,y >, a sequence U = < u.. . ,u > is a common supersequence of X and Y if items can be removed from U to produce X or Y. X&Y (stylized as X & Y) is the third studio album by the British rock band Coldplay. It was released on 6 June 2005 by Parlophone in the United Kingdom, and a day later by Capitol Records in the United States. The album was produced by Coldplay and producer Danton Supple. It is noted for its troubled and urgent development, with producer Ken Nelson having originally been tasked with producing much of the album; however, many songs written during his sessions were discarded owing to the band's dissatisfaction with them. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code. "U.F.O." is a song by British rock band Coldplay. It was written by all four members of the band for their fifth studio album, "Mylo Xyloto". The album's opening track, "Mylo Xyloto" and "A Hopeful Transmission" are based on the chords from the second half of this song. After the song ends, the track includes a short instrumental section (reminiscent of "Prospekt's March/Poppyfields") that segues into the following track, "Princess of China". The track also features samples from a sample of Sigur Rós' "Takk...". "Princess of China" is a duet recorded by British rock band Coldplay and Barbadian singer Rihanna for Coldplay's fifth studio album "Mylo Xyloto". The song was written by band members Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, and Chris Martin, along with Brian Eno, and is influenced by the music genres of electronic rock, electropop and R&B. The song was released as the fourth single from "Mylo Xyloto" and was sent to US Mainstream radio on 14 February 2012. It was later released as a digital download on 13 April 2012. A companion EP to the single, featuring an acoustic version of the song, was released on 1 June 2012. "Fuck U Betta" (stylized as "F**k U Betta"), also known as "Love U Betta" or "F U Betta" in clean versions, is a song by British singer Neon Hitch. The song was released as the first single from her now unreleased debut album Beg, Borrow & Steal. The song reached number one on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Club Play chart and number 29 on the "Billboard" Pop Songs chart. The discography of South Korean-born Australian recording artist Dami Im consists of three studio albums, two extended plays, ten singles, two album appearances, and four music videos. Im began her music career as a gospel singer in Korea and independently released her debut studio album, "Dream", in 2010. She was the winner on the fifth season of "The X Factor Australia" in 2013, and subsequently received a contract with Sony Music Australia. Im released her self-titled second studio album in November 2013, which features selected songs she performed as part of the top twelve on "The X Factor". The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipments of 70,000 copies. Additionally, the album also included Im's debut single "Alive", which topped the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum. She became the first "X Factor Australia" contestant to follow up a number one single with a number one album on the ARIA Charts. Mi Saw U (Burmese: မိစောဦး , ] ; also known as Min Saw U) was a Pagan princess, who was queen of two kings, Kyawswa of Pagan and Thihathu of Pinya, and mother of two kings, Uzana I of Pinya and Kyawswa I of Pinya. Saw U was a daughter of Narathihapate, the last sovereign king of Pagan. Married to her half-brother Kyawswa, Saw U was pregnant with Kyawswa's child (Uzana) in December 1297 when she was seized by Thihathu who had just overthrown Kyawswa. Thihathu raised Uzana as his own child and later selected him as heir apparent. Saw U also gave birth to Thihathu's child, also named Kyawswa. Both Uzana and Kyawswa went on to become kings of Pinya. Her youngest son Nawrahta defected to the Sagaing Kingdom c. 1349 after a disagreement with his brother Kyawswa.

**Question:** Irish print journalist, Arthur Quinlan, was the only one to interviewed which major figure of the Cuban Revolution?
**Answer:** Che Guevara

**Context:**
Eulogio Cantillo (September 13, 1911, Cuba - September 9, 1978, Miami, Florida, U.S.) was a general in the pre-revolutionary Cuban army. General Cantillo served as Chief of the Joint Staff during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Cantillo did not participate in the military coup that brought Batista to power. During the Cuban Revolution, he led Cuban soldiers in the fight against Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement. After the Cuban Revolution, He was tried by the revolutionary tribunals and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released before serving his entire sentence sometime in the sixties, and went into exile in Miami where he died in 1978. Coffee has been grown in Cuba since the mid-18th century. Boosted by French farmers fleeing the revolution in Haiti, coffee farms expanded from the western plains to the nearby mountain ranges. Coffee production in eastern Cuba significantly increased during the 19th and early 20th centuries. At its peak production, Cuba exported more than 20000 MT of coffee beans per year in the mid 1950s. After the Cuban Revolution and the nationalization of the coffee industry, coffee production slowly began to decline until it reached all time lows during the Great Recession. Once a major Cuban export, it now makes up an insignificant portion of Cuban trade. By the 21st century, 92 percent of the country's coffee was grown in area of the Sierra Maestra mountains. All Cuban coffee is exported by Cubaexport, which pays regulated prices to coffee growers and processors. Arthur Quinlan (15 January 1921 – 22 December 2012) was an Irish raconteur and print journalist with "The Irish Times". Known for his interviews with politicians, royalty and film stars in a career spanning more than 50 years, he was widely regarded as a very important figure in his field, and was both the first Irishman to get a jet across the Atlantic Ocean to New York in 1958 and the only western journalist to have interviewed Che Guevara. Considered a "master of executing international scoops", his work was sent across the world. The Republic of Cuba (Spanish: República de Cuba) of 1902 to 1959, refers to the historical period in Cuba from 1902, when Cuba seceded from US rule in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War that took Cuba from Spanish rule in 1898, until the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Cuban independence from the United States was guaranteed in the Platt Amendment proposed to the United States Congress in 1901. It was officially a representative democracy though at times it became controlled by a military junta. The Cuban Revolution of 1959 massively changed Cuban society, creating a socialist state and ended US economic dominance in Cuba. Ernesto "Che" Guevara (] June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture. The Cuban League was one of the earliest and longest lasting professional baseball leagues outside of the United States, operating in Cuba from 1878 to 1961. The schedule usually operated during the winter months, so the league was sometimes known as the "Cuban Winter League." It was always a small league, generally 3 to 5 teams, and was centered in Havana, though it sometimes included teams from outlying cities such as Matanzas or Santa Clara. The league became racially integrated in 1900, and during the first half of the 20th century the Cuban League was a premier venue for black and white players to meet. Many great black Northern American players competed in Cuba alongside native black and white Cuban stars such as José Méndez, Cristóbal Torriente, Adolfo Luque, and Martín Dihigo. After 1947, the Cuban League entered into an agreement with Major League Baseball and was used for player development. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, however, tensions rose with the new Communist government, and in March 1961 the government decreed the abolition of professional baseball. Cuba's National Art Schools (Escuelas Nacionales de Arte, now known as the Instituto Superior de Arte) are considered by historians to be among the most outstanding architectural achievements of the Cuban Revolution. These innovative, organic Catalan-vaulted brick and terra-cotta structures were built on the site of a former country club in the far western Havana suburb of Cubanacán, which used to be Havana's "Beverly Hills" and was then mainly reserved for Communist Party officials. The schools were conceived and founded by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1961, and they reflect the utopian optimism and revolutionary exuberance of the early years of the Cuban Revolution. Over their years of active use, the schools served as the primary incubator for Cuba’s artists, musicians, actors and dancers. Rock Around the Blockade (RATB), is a Cuba solidarity organisation in Britain founded by members of the Revolutionary Communist Group (UK) in 1995. RATB sees the struggle to defend the Cuban Revolution as part of building a movement for socialism and communism in Britain. In this is appears to differ from the Cuba Solidarity Campaign which attempts to build a broad front, largely but not exclusively through the mainstream labour movement, in support of the Cuban Revolution through emphasising the defence of Cuba's right to sovereignty. Brian Cuban is an American attorney, author, and activist. He is often interviewed authority on Male Eating Disorders and a lawyer and activist in the areas of First Amendment issues and hate speech. He is also the brother of Mark Cuban and resides in Dallas, Texas. He was born on January 11, 1961, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up in Pittsburgh and attended Mt. Lebanon High School. Cuban earned his undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University and his law degree from The University of Pittsburgh School of Law. He is licensed to practice law in Pennsylvania (inactive) and Texas, specializing in First Amendment issues. He runs a blog called "The Cuban Revolution" that he uses as a platform to discuss many First Amendment legal battles and news stories. Cuban immigration to the United States, for the most part, occurred in two periods: the first series of immigration of Cuban Americans from Cuba to the United States resulted from establishment of Cuban cigar factories in Tampa and from attempts to overthrow Spanish colonial rule by the movement led by José Martí, the second from dissatisfaction with communist rule by Fidel Castro following the Cuban Revolution. Massive Cuban migration to Miami during the second series led to major demographic and cultural changes in Miami. There was also economic emigration, particularly during the Great Depression in the 1930s.

This was the band's most punk-oriented release and contains five tracks, featuring one in English, "London". Steeltown were an Australian band based in the city of Brisbane who performed in the 90s a genre of synth, rock, pop and produced their greatest top forty chart hit with the song 'Hero' which was released in September 1991. They notably sold more recordings than any other band of the time based in the state of Queensland. (the video and a live performance can be seen on YouTube). The group members were Andy Richmond vocals, Peter Howard keyboards, Terry Gidman drums and Kate Richmond vocals and percussion and Reece Speceis Lead Guitar. The band were formed from the remnant members of a Scottish group called the Technicians who migrated to Australia in the 80s and who also attained top 40 status with their music releases, Hot for Love, Clockwork Clown and Sodier of Fortune through record companies Powderworks, EMI and BMG, and were published by MMA which was owned by legendary rock outfit INXS. Tappi Tíkarrass was an Icelandic punk band which added elements of funk, rock and jazz to their music, marking a difference from other traditional bands at that time. The band is also considered the first serious music project of now renowned singer Björk Guðmundsdóttir. INXS ( ) were an Australian rock band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney, New South Wales. They began playing covers in Western Australian pubs and clubs, occasionally playing some of their original music. Mainstays were main composer and keyboardist Andrew Farriss, drummer Jon Farriss, guitarists Tim Farriss and Kirk Pengilly, bassist Garry Gary Beers and main lyricist and vocalist Michael Hutchence. For twenty years, INXS was fronted by Hutchence, whose "sultry good looks" and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band.

Nýtt Líf (   , English: "New Life") is an Icelandic film directed by Þráinn Bertelsson and released in 1983. The film is a comedy shot in the Westman Islands and stars Eggert Þorleifsson and Karl Ágúst Úlfsson, among others.

Disco polo is a musical genre of popular music that is dance music, created in Poland in the late 1980s, initially known as "sidewalks music" ("muzyka chodnikowa"). This trend, also known as city folklore music, was popular in the mid-late 1990s, with its peak taking place around 1995–1997. Later observed a gradual decline in the popularity led to the temporary collapse in the early twenty-first century. Disco polo have enjoyed a renaissance of popularity in late 2007. Language Dictionary Polish Publishing PWN defines the genre as a Polish variant of disco music, with simple melodies. It is derived from disco, Euro disco contemporary folk music influenced by Italo disco and Polish folk songs (specifically, the vulgarized subgenre of which is mostly played at weddings and feasts). Kidandali is a stylistic music genre and one of only 2 music genres native to Uganda, the other being Kadongo Kamu. Kidandali is a word from the Ganda language which in translation can mean "local party" or "celebration". Music concerts and traditional wedding ceremonies (kwanjula) are examples of such "bidandali". The music itself is given this name because most times it is the kind of music played or performed at such local parties and functions. Some other sources and commentators refer to the genre alternatively as "Band music" while others refer to it as "Afrobeat". Rave music may either refer to the late 1980s/early 1990s genres of house, breakbeat, acid house, techno and hardcore techno, which were the first genres of music to be played at rave parties, or to any other genre of electronic dance music (EDM) that may be played at a rave. The genre "rave", also known as hardcore by early ravers, first appeared amongst the UK "acid" movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues, as well as on UK pirate radio stations. The genre would develop into oldschool hardcore, which lead onto newer forms of rave music such as drum and bass and 2-step, as well as other hardcore techno genres, such as gabber, hardstyle and happy hardcore. Rave music is usually presented in a DJ mix set, although live performances are not uncommon. Folk rock is a music genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre emerged from bands such as the Beatles, the Searchers, and the Animals in the UK, and Bob Dylan and the Byrds in the US, who played traditional folk music and songs with rock instrumentation. The term "folk rock" is first noted as being used by the U.S. music press in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music; the band's debut album was released the same month.

**Answer:** June

**Context:**
A revival meeting is a series of Christian religious services held to inspire active members of a church body to gain new converts. Nineteenth-century Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon said, "Many blessings may come to the unconverted in consequence of a revival among Christians, but the revival itself has to do only with those who already possess spiritual life." These meetings are usually conducted by churches or missionary organizations throughout the world. Notable historic revival meetings were conducted in the US by evangelist Billy Sunday and in Wales by evangelist Evan Roberts. The Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples) as an evangelical Protestant Canadian church body in North America (2004) can be traced to the formal organization of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in 1804, in Bourbon County, Kentucky under the leadership of Barton Warren Stone (1772–1844). The Stone Movement later merged with the efforts of Thomas Campbell (1772–1854) and his son Alexander Campbell (1788–1866) to become the Restoration Movement that gave birth to the Churches of Christ (Non-Instrumental), the Christian churches and churches of Christ, the Churches of Christ (non-institutional), and the Disciples of Christ. The Evangelical Christian Church (Christian Disciples) as a separate group within the Restoration tradition was reorganized in 2001. The Evangelical Christian Church's national office in Canada is in Waterloo, Ontario. Francis Asbury, also known as the Francis Asbury Memorial, is a public equestrian statue, by American artist Augustus Lukeman, located at 16th Street and Mt. Pleasant Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood. A Christian music festival (also known as a Jesus music festival or simply a Jesus festival) is a music festival held by the Christian community, in support of performers of Christian music. The festivals are characterized by more than just music; many feature motivational speakers and evangelists, and include seminars on Christian spiritual and missions topics, service, and evangelism. They are often viewed as evangelical tools, and small festivals can draw 10 times the crowd of traditional revival meetings. While the central theme of a Christian festival is Jesus Christ, the core appeal of a Christian music festival remains the artists and their music. Critics point out that the dichotomy of business and religious interests can be problematic for Christian festivals. In similar ways as the Christian music industry in general, festivals can be drawn away from their central theme and gravitate toward commercialization and mainstream acts in an attempt to draw crowds. The Revival of 1800 was a series of evangelical Christian meetings which began in Logan County, Kentucky, which ignited the subsequent events and influenced several of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening. The events represented a transition from traditions carried over from Europe to innovations that responded to the unique needs and personality of Americans in the new century. The startling manifestations of revival fervor that first occurred in June 1800 at the Red River Meeting House, a small Presbyterian congregation led by James McGready, began as a Scottish sacrament service, but brought about the important innovation of serial religious services later known as camp meetings. These multi-day gatherings hosted people from great distances for outdoor services focused on the heart-felt conversion and religious enthusiasm that came to characterize especially rural evangelicalism throughout the nineteenth century. The Logan County revival quickly spread into the larger Cumberland region of southwestern Kentucky and middle Tennessee and expanded outward in all directions attracting the attention of evangelical leaders such as Presbyterian-turned-Disciples of Christ leader, Barton Stone, and Methodists Francis Asbury and Peter Cartwright, as well as leaders in the Shaker and Cumberland Presbyterian movements, all of whom attended the revival meetings in their initial year-long period beginning in June 1800 and continuing through May 1801. The Brownsville Revival (also known as the Pensacola Outpouring) was a widely reported Christian revival within the Pentecostal Movement that began on Father's Day June 18, 1995, at Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida. Characteristics of the Brownsville Revival movement, as with other Christian religious revivals, included acts of repentance by parishioners and a call to holiness, said to be inspired by the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. Some of the occurrences in this revival fit the description of moments of religious ecstasy. More than four million people are reported to have attended the revival meetings from its beginnings in 1995 to around 2000. The Falcon Tabernacle, also known as the Octagon Tabernacle and the Little Tabernacle, is an historic octagon-shaped Pentecostal Holiness church building in Falcon, North Carolina. Built in 1898, it was designed by Julius A. Culbreth (1871-1950) for prayer meetings and was built using wood from trees that had been uprooted by a tornado. Culbreth, who was the founder of Falcon, chose the octagon shape because it reminded him of the tents used in revival meetings. In 1900 the building became the home of the Falcon Pentecostal Holiness Church, of which Culbreth was a leader. A tent revival is a gathering of Christian worshipers in a tent erected specifically for revival meetings, healing crusades, and church rallies. Tent revivals have had both local and national ministries. Francis Asbury ( ; August 20 or 21, 1745 – March 31, 1816) was one of the first two bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. As a young man in October 1771, the Englishman traveled to America and, during his 45 years there, he devoted his life to ministry, traveling on horseback and by carriage thousands of miles to those living on the frontier. John S. Coffman (October 16, 1848 – July 22, 1899) was a leader in the Mennonite Church in the late 19th century. He promoted evangelical and progressive reform through his positions in the Mennonite Publishing Company, revival meetings and chairmanship of the Elkhart Institute (a forerunner to Goshen College).

**Question:** From which city in Oklahoma is the singer of a song that peaked at number 24 on "Billboard" magazine's pop chart in December 1953?
**Answer:** Oklahoma City

**Context:**
"The Happening" is a 1967 song recorded by Motown artists The Supremes. The song served as the theme song of the 1967 Columbia Pictures film "The Happening", and was released as a single by Motown at the time of the film's release that spring. While the movie flopped, the song peaked at number-one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 pop singles chart in May, becoming The Supremes' tenth number-one single in the United States, peaking in the top 10 on the UK Pop Chart at number six, and in the top 5 in the Australian Pop Chart and in the Dutch Pop Chart. Gayla Rienette Peevey (born March 8, 1943) is a former singer and child star from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Her family moved to Ponca City, Oklahoma, in 1948. She is best known for her recording, under her maiden name Gayla Peevey, of "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" (Columbia 4-40106, 1953). Peevey recorded the novelty song when she was 10 years old. "A Song of Joy" ("Himno de la alegría") is the title of a popular rock song by the Spanish singer and actor Miguel Ríos. The song is set to the tune the Ninth Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, as arranged by Waldo de los Rios, who specialized in arranging classical music to contemporary rhythms. The single was enormously popular in many countries in 1970 (see 1970 in music), reaching number one on music charts in Australia, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the Easy Listening chart in the United States. On the U.S. pop chart, the song peaked at number 14 and was the only Top 40 hit for Ríos. In the United Kingdom, the song reached number 16 on the British pop chart. In Germany, the song is the most successful pop hymn ever. "Back 2 Good" is a song by Matchbox 20, released as the fifth single from their multi-platinum debut album "Yourself or Someone Like You". This song would prove to be their biggest hit song on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart from "Yourself or Someone Like You", peaking at number 24 in 1998 since their more successful prior hits, "Push" and "3 a.m." failed to hit the Hot 100 and only peaked on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and "Real World" barely made the top 40 on the Hot 100 at number 38. The song was not successful on the rock charts as it failed to chart on any because the song was considered too light for both rock and alternative radio stations with the song only having success on both pop and adult contemporary stations. The song was written by lead singer Rob Thomas and producer Matt Serletic, and is about a romantic relationship that seems to have reached its end, much to the chagrin of the singer. Mirage is the 13th studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on June 18, 1982.

"Waterloo" was a number-one hit for country singer Stonewall Jackson in 1959. It was written by John D. Loudermilk and Marijohn Wilkin. The single was the most successful of Jackson's career, spending five weeks at number one on the U.S. country music chart. The B-side of "Waterloo", "Smoke Along the Track", reached number 24 on the country chart. "Waterloo" was also Jackson's only Top 40 hit, where it stayed on the chart for 16 weeks, peaking at number four on the "Billboard" Hot 100 pop chart. "Keeper of the Castle" is a song recorded and released by American singing group the Four Tops, notable as the first hit the group scored on the ABC-Dunhill label after leaving Motown in 1972. The song, a social commentary on men's roles in relationships, was co-written by Dennis Lambert, who also produced the song and other songs off their album of the same name. Upon its release, the single peaked at number ten on the US pop chart and number seven on the R&B charts. Overseas, "Keeper of the Castle" peaked at number eighteen on the UK pop chart. "I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas" is a Christmas novelty song written by John Rox (1902–1957) and performed by Gayla Peevey (10 years old at the time) in 1953.

"Ben" (often referred to as "Ben's Song"), is a song written by Don Black and composed by Walter Scharf for the 1972 film of the same name (the sequel to the 1971 killer rat film "Willard"). It was performed in the film by Lee Montgomery and by Michael Jackson over the closing credits. Jackson's single, recorded for the Motown label in 1972, spent one week at the top of the U.S. pop chart. " Billboard" ranked it as the No. 20 song for 1972.

**Question:** Who was born first, Connie Willis or Margaret Landon?
**Answer:** Margaret Landon

**Context:**
Anna and the King of Siam is a 1946 drama film directed by John Cromwell. An adaptation of the 1944 novel of the same name by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon's book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights. The King and I is the fifth musical by the team of composer Richard Rodgers and dramatist Oscar Hammerstein II. It is based on Margaret Landon's novel, "Anna and the King of Siam" (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens, governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country. The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway's St. James Theatre. It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals. The King and I is a 1956 American musical film made by 20th Century Fox, directed by Walter Lang and produced by Charles Brackett and Darryl F. Zanuck. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is based on the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical "The King and I", based in turn on the novel "Anna and the King of Siam" by Margaret Landon. That novel in turn was based on memoirs written by Anna Leonowens, who became school teacher to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. Leonowens' stories were autobiographical, although various elements of them have been called into question. The film stars Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner.

**Question:** What is the species of animal which the town of Antelope, Kansas was named after?
**Answer:** Antilocapra americana

**Context:**
The pronghorn ( ) ("Antilocapra americana") is a species of artiodactyl mammal indigenous to interior western and central North America. Though not an antelope, it is often known colloquially in North America as the American antelope, prong buck, pronghorn antelope, or simply antelope because it closely resembles the true antelopes of the Old World and fills a similar ecological niche due to parallel evolution. Liwonde National Park is a national park in Malawi. It is located on the upper Shire River plain, east of the river, 140 km north of Limbe. Its southern gate lies about 6 km from the town center of Liwonde, and is accessible by bicycle taxi or walking. There are several affordable lodges near this entrance gate, the most famous being Liwonde Safari Camp and Bushmen's Baobab. The one main lodge inside the park is Mvuu (which means "hippo" in Chichewa) Camp. All lodges provide accommodations and game viewing on walking tours, drives, and boat/canoe trips. The park is home to several species of antelope (impala, kudu, waterbuck, etc.), elephants, buffalo, crocodiles, hippopotamus and many other mammals. Also there are more than 400 species of bird found in this park. Setaria is a genus of parasitic roundworms that infect domesticated mammals such as pigs, camels, cattle and horses. Some species also infect wild mammals such as deer and antelope. The genus consists of about 43 species. Members of the genus are uniquely parasites in the abdominal cavity of the body. They are mostly large-sized roundworms, possessing an elaborate head (cephalic) region that is characterised by spines, presence of four lips, and well-guarded mouth. Little is known about their pathogenic effects, but some are known to affect nervous system and eye. The larval infective forms are transmitted from one animal to another by the bite of mosquitoes and flies. In addition "Setaria marshalli" can be transmitted from the womb to new-born calf. Big-game hunting is the hunting of large game, almost always large terrestrial mammals, for meat, other animal by-products (such as horn or bone), trophy or sport. The term is historically associated with the hunting of Africa's "Big Five" game (lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and rhinoceros), and with tigers and rhinoceroses on the Indian subcontinent. Along with the big five animals, many other species are hunted including kudu, antelope, and hartebeest. Moose, elk, caribou, bison, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are the largest game hunted in North America, which is where most big-game hunting is conducted today. Edward M. Barrows (born August 8, 1946, in Detroit, Michigan) is a biologist who earned his BS in Botany and Zoology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1968, and his PhD in entomology, mentored by Charles Duncan Michener, at the University of Kansas, Lawrence in 1975. Further, he is a retired U.S. Army officer. He has had a lifetime interest in nature, science, and art. He performed research on bee nesting, predation, and reproductive behavior, for example, finding that female "Lasioglossum zephyrum" sweat bees have individual odors perceived by conspecific males. This was evidently the first discovery of invertebrate individual odors, as opposed to group or nest odors. He later found that males of the "Xylocopa virginica virginica" (large carpenter bee) have highly complex mate searching and mate-acquisition behaviors, perhaps more complicated that any other bee species and many other animal species. Students and he studied feeding behavior and recovery from injuries in "Mimus polyglottos" (northern mockingbirds). With students and established scientists, he studied or is studying arthropod community structure in a rare, freshwater, tidal, marsh, and associated habitats, evolution of floral display in "Asclepias syriaca" (common milkweed), parasitization and reproductive behavior of chalcidoid wasps, floral associates of rare plants, and other topics. His research in scientific communication led to the book "Animal Desk Reference, A Dictionary of Animal Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution" (3rd edition). His current research laboratory, the Laboratory of Entomology and Biodiversity, is in the Heyden Observatory of Georgetown University. Antelope is an unincorporated community in Marion County, Kansas, United States. Antelope got its name from antelope grazing near where the first school was being built. India boasts a variety of species and organisms. Apart from a handful of the major farm animals such as cows, buffaloes, goats, chickens, and camels, India has an amazingly wide spectrum of animals native to the country. It is home to Bengal and Indochinese tigers, Indian lions, deer, pythons, wolves, foxes, bears, crocodiles, wild dogs, monkeys, snakes, antelope species, varieties of bison and the Asian elephant. The region's rich and diverse wildlife is preserved in 120+ national parks, 18 Bio-reserves and 500+ wildlife sanctuaries across the country. India has some of the most biodiverse regions of the world and hosts four of the world’s 35 biodiversity hotspots – or treasure-houses – that is the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, Indo-Burma and Nicobar islands in Sundaland. Since India is home to a number of rare and threatened animal species, wildlife management in the country is essential to preserve these species. India is one of the seventeen megadiverse countries. According to one study, India along with other 16 mega diverse countries is home to about 60-70% of the world's biodiversity. India, lying within the Indomalaya ecozone, is home to about 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian (bird), 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species. Hartbeespoort, informally also known as "Harties", is a small resort town in the North West Province of South Africa, situated on slopes of the Magaliesberg mountain and the banks of the Hartbeespoort Dam. The name of the town means "gateway of the hartbees" (a species of antelope) in Afrikaans. It was previously known as Schoemansville, named after General Hendrik Schoeman, a Boer General in the Anglo-Boer War, who owned the farm that the Hartbeespoort Dam was built on. Ethiopia has a large variety of indigenous plant and animal species. In some areas, the mountains are covered with shrubs such as pyracantha, jasmine, poinsettia, and a varied assortment of evergreens. Caraway, carcade, cardamom, chat, coriander, incense, myrrh, and red pepper are common. The lakes in the Great Rift Valley region abound with numerous species of birds, and wild animals are found in every region. Among the latter are the Sudan cheetah, Ethiopian lion, civet, serval, African bush elephant, bushpig, gazelle, antelope, ibex, kudu, dik-dik, oribi, reedbuck, Somali wild ass, Grévy's zebra, hyena, baboon, and numerous species of monkey. As of 2002, there were at least 277 species of mammals, 262 species of birds, and over 6,600 species of plants throughout the country. The Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve is located on the north east coast of Unguja, 20 km from Zanzibar Town. The reserve is an important biodiversity spot in the coral rag zone. The forest reserve is rich both in faunal and floral species. The faunal species reported from the reserve are: Endemic species of red colobus monkey, Aders's duiker, sykes, blue monkeys, sunni antelope and several species of snakes. The avifauna species consist of 47 bird species, which includes Fischer's turaco, Zanzibar sombre greenbul, crowned hornbill and white-browed coucal. There are 100 plant species which includes many medicinal species. There are also coral caves within the reserve where stalactites and stalagmites can be seen. There is also a spice plantation near the reserve. Coral rag forest, a sensitive ecosystem, is under threat due to timber extraction since the 1970s. Conservation measures have been undertaken to preserve the rich biodiversity of the reserve.

At one time, the city was home to the tallest building in Latin America, the Martinelli Building, which opened in 1929 at a height of 130 meters. The Mirante do Vale, the largest building in the city, is 170 meters in height and was opened in 1960. Today, São Paulo is a city of low buildings, which rarely reach more than 80 meters and are mostly residential in nature. Municipal laws limit the construction of large skyscrapers and the tallest skyscrapers are located in three different regions. The city's financial center, fully occupied by skyscrapers, has moved. The city of São Paulo has the 10th highest number of buildings in the world taller than 90 meters, behind Hong Kong, New York City, Tokyo, Shanghai, Bangkok, Guangzhou, Chicago, and Singapore, respectively. One Raffles Link (Chinese: 莱佛士连道一号) is an office building located at Marina Centre, Singapore. The building is six storeys high with a basement and is managed by Hongkong Land. Completed in 2000, it was jointly designed by world-renowned architect, Kohn Pedersen Fox and Aedas LPT Architects. The development costs S$340 million and is a Grade A office building. VISA, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Citibank are major tenants of the building. Built on an elongated slip of land, the building offers the largest columnless floor-plates in the city.

**Question:** Stronger Together was used for the campaign comprised of the Vice Presidential candidate who was a Senator from what state?
**Answer:** Virginia

**Context:**
The Noynoy-Binay campaign or NoyBi began when Senator Francis Escudero endorsed the candidates Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III and Jejomar Binay as President and Vice President respectively. This was done without the consent of the two candidates, especially since Escudero, Binay, and Aquino all come from different political parties. Aquino had Manuel "Mar" Roxas II as his running mate for Vice President, while Binay was the Vice Presidential candidate of Joseph Estrada, who was aiming to be elected president for a second time. The campaign was nonetheless successful as Aquino and Binay were elected as President and Vice President of the Philippines. Matilde Zimmermann (born September 6, 1943) is an American author and professor who ran as the Socialist Workers Party candidate for United States Vice President in 1980. The party had three different Presidential candidates that year, Andrew Pulley, Richard H. Congress and Clifton DeBerry depending on the state. She was at the time a writer for the party newspaper "The Militant". Zimmermann also ran as an alternate vice presidential candidate for Andrea Gonzales in some states in 1984; Melvin T. Mason was the presidential candidate. Timothy Michael Kaine ( , born February 26, 1958) is an American attorney and politician who is the junior United States Senator from Virginia. A Democrat, Kaine was elected to the Senate in 2012 and was the nominee of his party for Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election. Mahamudu Bawumia (born 7 October 1963) is a Ghanaian economist and banker and the current Vice President of Ghana. He assumed office on 7 January 2017. He was a Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ghana until his nomination as the vice presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in 2008, standing alongside presidential candidate Nana Akufo-Addo. He also ran as the NPP vice-presidential candidate in the 2012 general elections and was the lead witness for the petitioners in the 2012/2013 Presidential Election Petition which challenged the declaration of John Mahama as winner of the election. He is married to Samira Ramadan and has four children. A running mate is a person running together with another person on a joint ticket during an election. The term is most often used in reference to the person in the subordinate position (such as the vice presidential candidate running with a presidential candidate) but can also properly be used when referring to both candidates, such as by saying Joko Widodo and Jusuf Kalla, and Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, were running mates in relation to the most recent presidential elections held in Indonesia and Kenya respectively. Willie Mae Reid is an African-American politician who ran as the Socialist Workers Party candidate for Mayor of Chicago in 1975, winning 16,693 votes but coming in third place against Richard J. Daley. The number had fallen from the number of signatures she'd acquired to get on the ballot, 66,000. She also ran as their vice presidential candidate in 1976 (Presidential candidate: Peter Camejo) and 1992 (Presidential candidate: James "Mac" Warren), winning 91,314 votes. Stronger Together: A Blueprint for America's Future is a 2016 book by Hillary Clinton and her vice-presidential running mate Tim Kaine, released during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It outlines their vision for the nation were they to win the election. The book was published by Simon & Schuster in September 2016. Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime is a book by political journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin about the 2008 United States presidential election. Released on January 11, 2010, it was also published in the United Kingdom under the title Race of a Lifetime: How Obama Won the White House. The book is based on interviews with more than 300 people involved in the campaign. It discusses factors including Democratic Party presidential candidate John Edwards' extramarital affair, the relationship between Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden, the failure of Republican Party candidate Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign and Sarah Palin's vice presidential candidacy. Alhaji Samuel Sidique Sam-Sumana (born April 7, 1962) was a Sierra Leonean politician who was the Vice President of Sierra Leone from September 17, 2007 to March 17, 2015. Sam-Sumana stood as the vice-presidential candidate of the All People's Congress (APC) in the 2007 presidential election, alongside presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma. The APC ticket defeated the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) presidential candidate Solomon Berewa and vice presidential candidate Momodou Koroma. Sam-Sumana took office as Vice President on September 17, 2007. In United States presidential elections, an unpledged elector is a person nominated to stand as an elector but who has not pledged to support any particular presidential or vice presidential candidate, and is free to vote for any candidate when elected a member of the Electoral College. Presidential elections are indirect, with voters in each state choosing electors on Election Day in November, and these electors choosing the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in December. Electors today are elected in every state by popular vote, and in practice have since the 19th century almost always agreed in advance to vote for a particular candidate — that is, they are said to have been "pledged" to that candidate. In the 20th century, however, several elections were contested by unpledged electors, who made no pledge to any candidate before the election. These anomalies largely arose over fissures within the Democratic Party over the issues of civil rights and segregation. No serious general election campaign has been mounted to elect unpledged electors in any state since 1964.

**Question:** Which mechanical device which engages and disengages power transmission  uses brake fluid?
**Answer:** hydraulic clutch

**Context:**
The G56 manual transmission is the only manual transmission currently available in a full-size pickup truck. It is also the only manual transmission being optioned in Class-4 and Class-5 trucks. The transmission uses Mopar ATF+4 transmission fluid. Ram trucks began running this transmission in the 2005 model-year trucks as a mid-year change to phase out the cast-iron 6-speed New Venture Gear 5600 transmission. Fluid deforms continuously on the application of shear stress, no matter how much small is it. Fluid comprises both gases and liquid. The technique of using liquid for power transmission is called as hydraulics while which uses gases for power transmission is called Pneumatics.In most hydraulic systems, mineral oils will be used while in most pneumatic systems, atmospheric air will be used. Brake bleeding is the procedure performed on hydraulic brake systems whereby the brake lines (the pipes and hoses containing the brake fluid) are purged of any air bubbles. This is necessary because, while the brake fluid is an incompressible liquid, air bubbles are compressible gas and their presence in the brake system greatly reduces the hydraulic pressure that can be developed within the system. The same methods used for bleeding are also used for purging, where the old fluid is replaced with new fluid, which is necessary maintenance. A hydraulic brake is an arrangement of braking mechanism which uses brake fluid, typically containing glycol ethers or diethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling mechanism to the braking mechanism. Roto Hydramatic (sometimes spelled Roto Hydra-Matic or Roto-Hydramatic) was an automatic transmission built by General Motors and used on some Oldsmobile and Pontiac and Holden models from 1961–1965. It was based on the earlier, four-speed Hydramatic, but was more compact, providing only three forward speeds plus a small 8" fluid coupling with a stator inside of the fluid coupling. Oldsmobile, one of the users of this transmission, called the fluid couplings stator the "Accel-A-Rotor." The lightweight, aluminum-cased transmission was sometimes nicknamed the "Slim Jim." HydraMatic Division calls the Roto a four range, three gear HydraMatic. It counts the stator multiplication @ 3.50 to one as a first gear, and when road speed and the two coupling halves speed match, it counts the same gear with fluid now passing straight through the stator as 2nd gear at 2.93 to one. Second gear (or third range) has a ratio of 1.56 and because the fluid coupling is drained for this gear ratio making the front clutch apply makes this a rare automatic that is in FULL mechanical lock-up (coupling drained) in second gear. Fourth range the coupling fills releasing the front clutch makes a ratio of 1 to 1. This transmission, like single and dual range, and dual coupling hydramatics also have the feature of split torque in the transmission whereby in fourth or high gear only 40-to 50% depending on transmission, 40% in Roto's case, but because of the design the coupling is only required to carry 40% of the engine torque. The rest is (60%) is in full mechanical connection making these hydramatics the most efficient automatic until the wide spread use of the lock-up torque converter. A winch is a mechanical device that is used to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the "tension" of a rope or wire rope (also called "cable" or "wire cable"). In its simplest form it consists of a spool and attached hand crank. In larger forms, winches stand at the heart of machines as diverse as tow trucks, steam shovels and elevators. The spool can also be called the winch drum. More elaborate designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or internal combustion drives. Some may include a solenoid brake and/or a mechanical brake or ratchet and pawl device that prevents it from unwinding unless the pawl is retracted. A heat exchanger is a device used to transfer heat between a solid object and a fluid, or between two or more fluids. The fluids may be separated by a solid wall to prevent mixing or they may be in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries, natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a heat exchanger is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant. Brake fluid is a type of hydraulic fluid used in hydraulic brake and hydraulic clutch applications in automobiles, motorcycles, light trucks, and some bicycles. It is used to transfer force into pressure, and to amplify braking force. It works because liquids are not appreciably compressible—in their natural state, the component molecules do not have internal voids and the molecules pack together well, so bulk forces are directly transferred to compress the fluid's chemical bonds. A polyphase system is a means of distributing alternating-current electrical power. Polyphase systems have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a definite time offset between the voltage waves in each conductor. Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors. The most common example is the three-phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. A major advantage of three phase power transmission (using three conductors, as opposed to a single phase power transmission, which uses two conductors), is that, since the remaining conductors act as the return path for any single conductor, the power transmitted by a balanced three phase system is three times that of a single phase transmission but only one extra conductor is used. Thus, a 50% / 1.5x increase in the transmission costs achieves a 200% / 3.0x increase in the power transmitted. A clutch is a mechanical device which engages and disengages power transmission especially from driving shaft to driven shaft.

In 2015, Viper Exchange Racing was granted an entry in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the No. 53 SRT Viper GTS-R was the only Viper to run in the event. A tobashi scheme is a financial fraud where a client's losses are hidden by an investment firm by shifting them between the portfolios of other (genuine or fake) clients. Any real client with portfolio losses can therefore have their accounts flattered by this process. This cycling cannot continue indefinitely and so the investment firm itself ends up picking up the cost. As it is ultimately expensive there must be a strong incentive for the investment firm to pursue this activity on behalf of their clients. Bain Capital is a global alternative investment firm based in Boston, Massachusetts. It specializes in private equity, venture capital and credit products. Bain Capital invests across a range of industry sectors and geographic regions. As of June 2014, the firm managed more than $75 billion of investor capital across its various investment platforms.

The technique was developed to reduce fuel vapor emissions in response to Partial Zero-Emission Vehicle (PZEV) requirements. The first application was for the 2005 Ford GT. A multilateral trading facility (MTF) is a European regulatory term for a self-regulated financial trading venue. These are alternatives to the traditional stock exchanges where a market is made in securities, typically using electronic systems. The operation of a MTF is considered an investment service. The concept was introduced within the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), a European Directive designed to harmonise retail investors protection and allow investment firms to provide services throughout the EU. Article 4 (15) of MiFID describes MTF as multilateral system, operated by an investment firm or a market operator, which brings together multiple third-party buying and selling interests in financial instruments – in the system and in accordance with non-discretionary rules – in a way that results in a contract. The term 'non-discretionary rules' means that the investment firm operating an MTF has no discretion as to how interests may interact. Interests are brought together by forming a contract and the execution takes place under the system's rules or by means of the system's protocols or internal operating procedures.

**Question:** The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains involved the king of the nomadic tribes of which peoples?
**Answer:** Germanic

**Context:**
Scythian art is art, primarily decorative objects, such as jewellery, produced by the nomadic tribes in the area known to the ancient Greeks as Scythia, which was centred on the Pontic-Caspian steppe and ranged from modern Kazakhstan to the Baltic coast of modern Poland and to Georgia. The identities of the nomadic peoples of the steppes is often uncertain, and the term "Scythian" should often be taken loosely; the art of nomads much further east than the core Scythian territory exhibits close similarities as well as differences, and terms such as the "Scytho-Siberian world" are often used. Other Eurasian nomad peoples recognised by ancient writers, notably Herodotus, include the Massagetae, Sarmatians, and Saka, the last a name from Persian sources, while ancient Chinese sources speak of the Xiongnu or Hsiung-nu. Modern archaeologists recognise, among others, the Pazyryk, Tagar, and Aldy-Bel cultures, with the furthest east of all, the later Ordos culture a little west of Beijing. The art of these peoples is collectively known as steppes art. The Visigoths ( ; ; Latin: "Visigothi", "Wisigothi", "Vesi", "Visi", "Wesi", or "Wisi" ; Italian: "Visigoti" ) were the western branches of the nomadic tribes of Germanic peoples referred to collectively as the Goths. These tribes flourished and spread throughout the late Roman Empire in Late Antiquity, or what is known as the Migration Period. The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups (possibly the Thervingi) who had invaded the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople in 378. Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient. The Visigoths invaded Italy under Alaric I and sacked Rome in 410. After the Visigoths sacked Rome, they began settling down, first in southern Gaul and eventually in Spain and Portugal, where they founded the Visigothic Kingdom and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD. The Nomadic Tribes and Denotified Tribes consist of about 60 million people in India, out of which about five million live in the state of Maharashtra. There are 315 Nomadic Tribes and 198 Denotified Tribes. Theodoric I ( 390 or 393 – 20 or 24 June 451) was the King of the Visigoths from 418 to 451. An illegitimate son of Alaric, Theodoric is famous for his part in defeating Attila at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451, where he was killed on June 20. The Sanapana are one of many nomadic tribes inhabiting the lower Gran Chaco of western Paraguay. With the introduction of Mennonite settlements in the central Chaco in the 1930s, many nomadic tribes semi-settled near the Mennonites. The Mennonites established Missions to many of these tribes, often grouping linguistically similar tribes nearby. The Sanapana and Lengua were settled on La Esperanza mission, southeast of Filadelfia, just off the Pan-American Highway. The Lengua, in their tongue, refer to themselves as "Enhlit," which means "the people." The Sanapana refer to themselves as "Nenhlet," which also means "the people." A standard conversation among the Sanapana-Lengua often includes words from their language, mixed with Spanish and Guaraní, the national languages of Paraguay, and some Low German, the primary language of the Mennonites. Gondioc (Proto-Germanic: "*Gunþawīgaz" ; died 473), also called "Gundioc" and "Gundowech", was King of the Burgundians following the destruction of Worms by the Huns in 436, succeeding Gundahar. In 451, Gondioc joined forces with Flavius Aetius against Attila, the king of the Huns, on the Catalaunian Plains. Gondioc married the sister of Ricimer, the Gothic general at the time ruling the Western Roman Empire. The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), also called the Battle of the Campus Mauriacus, Battle of Châlons or the Battle of Maurica, took place on June 20, 451 AD, between a coalition led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. It was one of the last major military operations of the Western Roman Empire, although Germanic foederati composed the majority of the coalition army. Whether the battle was strategically conclusive is disputed: The Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul, and installed Merovech as king of the Franks. However, the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. The Hunnic Empire was later dismantled by a coalition of their Germanic vassals at the Battle of Nedao in 454. The history of Phoenix, Arizona goes back millennia, beginning with nomadic paleo-Indians who existed in the Americas in general, and the Salt River Valley in particular, about 9,000 years ago until about 6,000 BC. Hunters, their primary prey were mammoths. As that prey moved eastward, they followed, vacating the area. Other nomadic tribes (archaic Indians) moved into the area, mostly from Mexico to the south and California to the west. Around approximately 1,000 BC, the nomadic began to be accompanied by two other types of cultures, commonly called the farmers and the villagers, prompted by the introduction of maize into their culture. Out of these archaic Indians, the Hohokam civilization arose. The Hohokam first settled the area around 1 AD, and in about 500 years, they had begun to establish the canal system which enabled agriculture to flourish in the area. They suddenly disappeared by 1450, for unknown reasons. By the time the first Europeans arrived at the beginning of the 16th century, the two main groups of native Indians who inhabited the area were the O'odham and Sobaipuri tribes. Thorismund (Gothic: Þaurismoþs, also Thorismod or Thorismud, as manuscripts of our chief source confusingly attest), ( 420 – 453) became king of the Visigoths after his father Theodoric was killed in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 CE. He was murdered in 453 and was succeeded by his brother Theodoric II. Sudanese nomadic conflicts are non-state conflicts between rival nomadic tribes taking place in the territory of Sudan and, since 2011, South Sudan. Conflict between nomadic tribes in Sudan is common, with fights breaking out over scarce resources, including grazing land, cattle and drinking water. Some of the tribes involved in these clashes have been the Messiria, Maalia, Rizeigat and Bani Hussein Arabic tribes inhabiting Darfur and West Kordofan, and the Dinka, Nuer and Murle African ethnic groups inhabiting South Sudan. Conflicts have been fueled by other major wars taking place in the same regions, in particular the Second Sudanese Civil War, the War in Darfur and the Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile.

**Question:** Who were the guns stolen from the HMS ship "Marlin" originally produced for?
**Answer:** British Army

**Context:**
HSwMS "Gustav V" was a "Sverige"-class coastal defence ship of the Swedish Navy. The vessel was the third and last ship in the Sverige class along with HMS Sverige and HMS Drottning Victoria. Gustav V was launched on September 15, 1917 at Kockums in Malmö and delivered to the Navy on January 9, 1922. The design consisted of four 28 cm cannons and a secondary armament of eight 15.2 cm cannons. During the interwar period, the ship underwent several modernizations and was one of the most powerful vessels in the fleet during the Second World War. The ship was put in reserve in 1948, was decommissioned in 1957 and was later sold for scrapping in Karlskrona. However, the ship remained at Berga Academy of War as of 1968. Two of the ship's 15.2 cm guns are preserved in the battery at Häggmansberget in the defensive Kalix Line, around Kalix. The Vickers machine gun or Vickers gun is a name primarily used to refer to the water-cooled .303 British (7.7 mm) machine gun produced by Vickers Limited, originally for the British Army. The machine gun typically required a six to eight-man team to operate: one fired, one fed the ammunition, the rest helped to carry the weapon, its ammunition, and spare parts. It was in service from before the First World War until the 1960s, with air-cooled versions of it on many Allied World War I fighter aircraft. HMS "James Watt" was a 91-gun steam and sail-powered second rate ship of the line. She had originally been ordered as one of a two ship class, with her sister HMS "Cressy" , under the name HMS "Audacious". She was renamed on 18 November 1847 in honour of James Watt, the inventor of the steam engine. She was the only Royal Navy ship to bear this name. Both ships were reordered as screw propelled ships, "James Watt" in 1849, and "Cressy" in 1852. "James Watt" became one of the four-ship "Agamemnon"-class of ships of the line. They were initially planned as 80-gun ships, but the first two ships built to the design, HMS "Agamemnon" and "James Watt", were rerated on 26 March 1851 to 91 guns ships, later followed by the remainder of the class. In August 1914 a consignment of Vickers machine guns are stolen off a Royal Navy ship, HMS "Marlin". An RN Lieutenant aboard the ship goes undercover as a white hunter through British East Africa to find the weapons before they get into the hands of the Germans and alter the balance of power in Africa. In January, 1938 the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force(CNVF) was created with Commander W.G. Beauchamp as Commanding Officer. On 31 August 1939, the CNVF was mobilized for war duties. Three years later, the CNVF was offered to, and accepted by the Royal Navy (RN) as a Volunteer Reserve, the "Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve", or CRNVR. It continued under RN operational and administrative command until March 1946. With the end of the war, it reverted to Ceylon Government Control, though yet CRNVR in name. In the 1939-1946 period, the CRNVR carried out several operational duties, mainly at sea. Cutting its teeth on the Port Commission Tugs SAMSON and GOLIATH, it later manned and operated trawlers and Antarctic whalers converted as Minesweepers and fitted out with guns, submarine detection equipment and anti-submarine weaponry. They were the HMS Overdale Wyke (the first ship to be purchased by the Government of Ceylon), HMS Okapi, HMS Semla, HMS Sambhur, HMS Hoxa, HMS Balta and HM Tugs Barnet and C 405. In addition the CRNVR manned several Motor Fishing Vessels (MFV), Harbour Defence Motor Launch (HDML) and miscellaneous auxiliary vessels. All were manned exclusively by CRNVR personnel. These ships were meant to sweep and guard the approaches the harbors but were often used on extended missions outside Ceylon waters. In the course of these operations, the ships came under enemy fire, recovered essential information from Japanese aircraft that were shot down, sailed to Akyab after the Burma front was opened in two FMVs for harbour duties and, was called upon to accept the surrender of the Italian Light Cruiser Eritrea and escort her to port with a prize crew on board. HMS "Valiant" was the second ship of the "Hector"-class armoured frigates ordered by the Royal Navy in 1861. Her builders went bankrupt shortly after she was laid down, which significantly delayed her completion. After being launched in 1863, she waited a further five years to receive her guns due to supply issues. Upon being commissioned in 1868 the ship was assigned as the First Reserve guard ship for Southern Ireland, where she remained until she was decommissioned in 1885. "Valiant" was hulked in 1897 as part of the stoker training school HMS "Indus" before becoming a storeship for kite balloons during the First World War. The ship was converted to a floating oil tank in 1926 and served in that role until sold for scrap in 1956. The Capture of the Vigilant involved Commodore Warren in HMS Superb (60 guns), Captain Durell in HMS Eltham (40 guns), Captain Calmady in HMS Launceston, Captain Douglas in HMS Mermaid and Captain John Rous of HMS Shirley Galley who fought the French ship Vigilant (64 guns) off Louisbourg. Captain Douglas in the Mermaid (40 guns) engaged the French ship Vigilant. John Rous in the Shirley Galley was the first to fire, giving the ship several broadsides into the stern. Captain Durell was next to give a broadside. The Commodore got alongside the ship they fired briskly, tearing the rigging and sails to pieces. Fog settled in and the Vigilant got away. In the morning, the Vigilant was visible and clearly wrecked. They took 100 French sailors prisoner to Boston. HMS "Unicorn" was a 28-gun "Lyme"-class sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy. She was originally ordered as a 24-gun ship to the draft of the French privateer "Tyger". The third vessel of the Royal Navy to bear the name, "Unicorn", as well as HMS "Lyme" which was a near-sister, were the first true frigates built for the Royal Navy. They were actually completed with 28 guns including the four smaller weapons on the quarterdeck, but the latter were not included in the ship's official establishment until 22 September 1756. The two ships differed in detail, "Unicorn" having a beakhead bow, a unicorn figurehead , two-light quarter galleries and only five pairs of quarterdeck gunports, while "Lyme" had a round bow, a lion figurehead, three-light quarter galleries and six pairs of quarterdeck gunports. HMS "Hannibal" was a "Majestic"-class pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy, and the sixth ship to bear the name HMS "Hannibal". The ship was laid down at the Pembroke Dock in May 1894, she was launched in April 1896, and commissioned into the fleet in April 1898. She was armed with a main battery of four 12 in guns and a secondary battery of twelve 6 in guns. The ship had a top speed of 16 kn . HMS "Benbow" was the third of four "Iron Duke"-class battleship s of the Royal Navy, the third ship to be named in honour of Admiral John Benbow. Ordered in the 1911 building programme, the ship was laid down at the William Beardmore and Company shipyard in May 1912, was launched in November 1913, and was completed in October 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. The four "Iron Duke"s were very similar to the preceding "King George V" class , with an improved secondary battery. She was armed with a main battery of ten 13.5 in guns and twelve 6 in secondary guns. The ship was capable of a top speed of 21.25 kn , and had a 12 in thick armoured belt.

The McMillan Woods CCC camp was Civilian Conservation Corps camp NP-2 on the Gettysburg Battlefield planned in September 1933  near CCC Camp Renaissance in Pitzer Woods (camp NP-1). Captain Francis J. Moran moved from Camp Renaissance to become the new camp NP-2 commander in October 1933 (supervisors under Superintendent Farrell included Charles Heilman in 1936, and Major Renn Lawrence was the 1937 CCC sub-district commander.) The camp opened a new recreation hall in 1934  and provided manpower for building the veterans camp for the 1938 Gettysburg reunion, and about 50 enrollees of CCC Company #1355-C served as aides for unaccompanied veterans. During the reunion, Company F of the 34th Infantry used the CCC camp and had a headquarters office under Major C. Gilchrist (executive officer of the "regular army camp") and Capt. E. E. Wright. Captain Frederick L. Slade was the CCC commander on April 1, 1939. Samuel Jared Taylor (born September 15, 1951) is an American white nationalist and white supremacist. He is the founder and editor of "American Renaissance", a white supremacist magazine. Taylor is also an author and the president of "American Renaissance"' s parent organization, New Century Foundation, through which many of his books have been published. He is a former member of the advisory board of "The Occidental Quarterly", and a former director of the National Policy Institute, a Virginia-based white nationalist think tank. He is also a board member and spokesperson of the Council of Conservative Citizens. Bennington was one of the camping places for Indians that came through the Bear Lake valley each year on their hunting and fishing trips. They camped there until the 1930s, asking for food from the residents. An emigrant massacre happened at the mouth of four Mile Canyon. The emigrants head camp of the main road for better feed and plentiful water. A band of Shoshone led by "Paughatello" killed all the members of the company except for one 15-year-old boy, who hid in a wash and made his way back to another company. He went on to Oregon or California with the team. The battle spanned over 40 acres along the creek. Seven wagons, 20 people, 33 horses and 14 head of livestock were involved. Wagon parts, bones, cap and ball pistols, swords and other relics could be found decades later. The first town site of Bennington was located on block West on highway 30 at the Cemetery and Wright Roads, where the old Amos Wright log cabin still stands. The first settlers, Jared Bullock, and Jonathan Hoopes, came in the fall of 1864 and settled on the south side of Bennington Creek. Then Evan M. Greene, Hyrum Hoopes and Edmond Homer came. Six families spent the winter in 1864. In 1865 and 1866 more people were called to settle . In 1866 the community was officially named after a town in Vermont where Brigham Young once lived. In 1873 the town had a meeting, and the present town site was chosen. A church, school, store/post office and new homes were eventually built. Evan Green was the first Presiding Elder serving from 1864 to 1865, followed by Dudley Merrell, who presided until 1870, then Alonzo became the first Bishop. Church was held in a vacant house until one could be built. The first living white baby born Feb. 18, 1866 was Winnifred Rebecca Wright daughter of Amos R. Wright. The first death was Admanza Greene who died of pneumonia at age 10. Jared Bullock's wife died of childbirth. She was buried at the end of the haystack and then moved to the present cemetery later. Deep snow, cold weather and primitive living conditions made living here hard. A traveling band and a dancing academy taught by John Dunn was organized to help people get through the long winter mounts. In 1934 there was a terrible drought. At that time each home and building at the new town site had their own well. They all dried up except the one at the school so people carried water from there. The WPA helped with a new water system and during 1934-35 the men of the community dug ditches and laid the pipe to their homes. They had a big celebration at its completion in August 1936. Today Bennington is a thriving town with many new homes and a big church. "Jared Has Aides" is the first episode of the sixth season of the adult American animated television series "South Park". It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 6, 2002. The episode was rated TV-MA in the United States, except on syndicated broadcasts, where it is rated TV-14 instead. In the episode, weight loss advocate Jared Fogle incurs the wrath of South Park after he announces that he lost weight because he has aides (misinterpreted as AIDS). This leads the boys to try to use Butters as their own advocate for City Wok. The episode also parodies the film "Philadelphia".

**Answer:** Commissioner

**Context:**
Marcel Louis Vonk (born 14 January 1974) is a poker player and the first Dutch person to win a World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet in No Limit Hold'em (NLHE). On July 5, 2010, he beat out 3,843 opponents to capture the gold bracelet in event #54: $1,000 No-Limit Hold'em, taking home $570,960 USD for the victory. Tristan Wade is an American professional poker player from Boynton Beach, Florida. He won his first World Series of Poker bracelet at the 2011 World Series of Poker Europe. In addition to a bracelet, 2011 saw Wade earn his first 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) final tables, with two at the summer 2011 World Series of Poker before his fall bracelet in Europe. Wade is also an instructor at Deepstacks University. Wade is an alumnus of University of Central Florida where he earned a bachelor of science degree in psychology. WSOP.com lists him as a resident of Boynton Beach, Florida, while Hendon mob claims he is from Orlando, Florida. Wade made his first trip to Europe at the age of 26 in 2011 because of Black Friday, which had limited his options for play in the United States. The World Poker Tour bracelet is the World Poker Tour's (WPT) answer to the World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet. Beginning in 1976, the WSOP started awarding bracelets to winners of WSOP events. The WSOP bracelet has become synonymous with greatness. "It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously," stated World Series of Poker Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. "It is the equivalent of winning the Stanley Cup in hockey or the Lombardi Trophy in football." Since their introduction, a poker player's success has been measured by the number of bracelets they had won. With introduction of the WPT bracelet, the WPT hopes to capitalize on the prestige of winning poker bracelets. WPT Founder, President and CEO, Steve Lipscomb said, "The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that Benny Binion [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago." Anne LaBarr "Annie" Duke (née Lederer; September 13, 1965) is an American professional poker player and author. She holds a World Series of Poker (WSOP) gold bracelet from 2004 and used to be the leading money winner among women in WSOP history (a title now held by Vanessa Selbst). Duke won the 2004 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions and the National Heads-Up Poker Championship in 2010. She has written a number of instructional books for poker players, including "Decide to Play Great Poker" and "The Middle Zone", and she published her autobiography, "How I Raised, Folded, Bluffed, Flirted, Cursed, and Won Millions at the World Series of Poker", in 2005. The fifth World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) took place from October 7, 2011 to October 20, 2011. There were seven bracelet events, culminating in the €10,400 WSOPE Championship No-Limit Hold'em event. Events were held at the Majestic Barrière Cannes and the Le Croisette Casino Barrière in Cannes, France. The 7 official gold bracelet events were complemented by a total of 51 other events in the two-week schedule, the most prominent of which is the €550 Ladies only event. ESPN broadcast the Main Event on its worldwide television network, and all official gold bracelet events streamed live on WSOP.com. Konstantin Puchkov (born 1952) is a Russian poker player, horse trainer and horse breeder from Moscow. He was the fourth Russian-born player to earn a World Series of Poker bracelet.

José-Luis Velador (born in Jalisco, Mexico) is a Mexican-American professional poker player from Corona, California, who is a two-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner. He won his first bracelet at the 2008 World Series of Poker in the $1,500 No-Limit Hold'em event and then two years later at the 2010 World Series of Poker he won his second bracelet after defeating David Chiu heads-up in the $2,500 Pot Limit Hold'em/Omaha event. The World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP. Even if the victory occurred before 1976, WSOP championships are now counted as "bracelets". During the first years of the WSOP only a handful of bracelets were awarded each year. In 1990, there were only 14 bracelet events. By 2000, that number increased to 24. As the popularity of poker has increased during the 2000s, the number of events has likewise increased. In 2011, 58 bracelets were awarded at the WSOP, seven at the World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE), and one to the WSOP National Circuit Champion. This brought the total number of bracelets awarded up to 959. Five additional bracelets were awarded for the first time in April 2013 at the inaugural World Series of Poker Asia-Pacific (WSOP APAC) in Melbourne, Australia. .

**Question:** Which wrestler, who died in 2009, featured on the wrestling show Starrcade?
**Answer:** "Dr. Death" Steve Williams

**Context:**
Starrcade (1994): Triple Threat was a major professional wrestling show, broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV) that took place on December 27, 1994 from the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. The show was produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and was the 12th overall show under that banner since its inception in 1983. The main event of the show was WCW World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan defending the title against his former friend-turned-rival The Butcher. The show also included Jim Duggan defending the WCW United States Championship against Vader and Johnny B. Badd defending the WCW World Television Championship against Arn Anderson. Starrcade (1984) was a major professional wrestling show broadcast live on closed-circuit television that took place on November 22, 1984. The show was promoted by Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) banner and took place at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. The main event of the show was billed as "the Million Dollar Challenge" as the storyline was that the winner of the match would not only win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but also win a $1,000,000 purse, part of the illusion that professional wrestling was a legitimate sporting competition. The main event saw champion "The Nature Boy" Ric Flair defend the championship against long time rival "The American Dream" Dusty Rhodes, with boxer Joe Frazier acting as the special guest referee for the match. The show also saw the championship matches for the NWA United States Championship, NWA World Television Championship, NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, NWA Brass Knuckles Championship and NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. WCW/New Japan Supershow was an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) jointly promoted by American Atlanta, Georgia based World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and the Japanese New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) wrestling promotions. It was held in 1991, 1992 and 1993, and was promoted as "Starrcade" in Japan, but not billed as such in the United States due to WCW already having a show called "Starrcade" held each year in December. The show would be taped in Japan and then edited and aired in North America at a later date in WCW. The last two of this three events were also the two first January 4 Dome Show. Starrcade (1996) was the fourteenth annual Starrcade professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event. It was the ninth Starrcade event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and it took place on December 29, 1996 from the Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee. The event featured the New World Order (nWo) stable, which formed in July. Craig Williams (born May 1, 1983), better known by his ring name, Human Tornado, is an American professional wrestler. His character was that of a stereotypical 1970s blaxploitation street pimp. He performed primarily on the Californian independent circuit, most prominently for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), Empire Wrestling Federation, and Alternative Wrestling Show. In addition, he also performed for Ring of Honor, Combat Zone Wrestling, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, and the short-lived MTV promotion Wrestling Society X. Starrcade is a recurring professional wrestling event, originally broadcast via closed-circuit television and eventually broadcast via pay-per-view television, held from 1983 to 2000 by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and later World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year, much in the same vein that its rival, the World Wrestling Federation, regarded WrestleMania. As a result, the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion. Starrcade (1992): BattleBowl/The Lethal Lottery II was a major annual professional wrestling show, broadcast on pay-per-view (PPV) that took place on December 28, 1992, from The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia. The show was produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and was the 10th overall show under that banner since its inception in 1983. The focus of the show was the second ever "Lethal Lottery" / "Battle Bowl" tournament where randomly paired tag teams competed for a spot in the Battle Bowl battle royal at the end of the night. The show also saw Ron Simmons defend the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against "Dr. Death" Steve Williams, the team of Shane Douglas and Ricky Steamboat putting the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the line against the team of Brian Pillman and Barry Windham and Masahiro Chono defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against The Great Muta. In addition Sting faced off against Vader in the finals of the ""King of Cable"" tournament. Starrcade (1997) was the fifteenth annual Starrcade professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event. It was the tenth Starrcade event produced by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and it took place on December 28, 1997 from the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. It featured the ongoing storyline between WCW and the New World Order (nWo) organization. Starrcade (1983) was the first annual Starrcade professional wrestling event. It was produced under the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) banner by Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). The event took place on November 24, 1983 at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina and was broadcast on closed-circuit television around the Southern United States.

It is the first time in 20 years that Nicaragua will have a national flag carrier, after Aeronica ceased operations in 1991. Since then, the flag carrier status was awarded to Nicaragüense de Aviación also known as NICA Airlines. Several airlines had tried to become the Nicaraguan flag carrier like CAAL (Central American Airlines), SANSA (Servicios Aereos Nicaraguenses S.A.) but none of these survived a year. Today even NICA Airlines (6Y) is registered as the national airline of Nicaragua, the only international flight it operated once (Managua to Miami) and is done under the TACA code (TA) as a full TACA Airlines flight. Tiger Airways Australia Pty Ltd, operating as Tigerair Australia, is an Australian low-cost airline. It commenced services in the Australian domestic airline market on 23 November 2007 as Tiger Airways Australia. It is a fully owned subsidiary of Virgin Australia Holdings. The airline is based in Melbourne, Victoria, with its main base at Melbourne Airport. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Australia (CASA) grounded the airline in 2011; as a result operating bases at Adelaide and Avalon were shut down and it initially only operated out of its Melbourne base after returning to the air. On 7 March 2012, Tigerair announced the reopening of a second base at Sydney Airport. Tigerair Mandala ("formerly Mandala Airlines") was a low-cost airline headquartered in Jakarta, Indonesia and is an associate company of the Singapore-based Tigerair Group. The former full service airline repositioned itself as a budget airline/low-cost carrier (LCC) following a year-long grounding in 2011 caused by debt woes. Mandala resumed operations in April 2012 following an injection of fresh capital by Indonesian conglomerate Saratoga Investment Corp which took over 51% of the airline, with partner Tigerair taking up 33.3% and the rest by creditors. Tiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd, operating as Tigerair, was a budget airline headquartered in Singapore. It operated services to regional destinations in Southeast Asia, Bangladesh, China and India from its main base at Singapore Changi Airport. It was founded as an independent airline in 2003, and was listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange under the Tiger Airways Holdings name in 2010.

It operates domestic and international scheduled services from Manila, Cebu, Davao and Zamboanga. The airline has been re-branded a number of times, first as Air Philippines, then Airphil Express, and is now known as PAL Express. After a series of financial losses, Air Philippines ceased operations until it was acquired by investors from Philippine Airlines. After the acquisition, the airline was re-launched as PAL Express, operating some routes and slot assignments of its sister company Philippine Airlines until management decided to re-brand the carrier as a budget airline known as Airphil Express. However, in March 2013, the company's CEO announced that the name would be reverted to PAL Express. As a codeshare partner of Philippine Airlines, PAL Express operates as a full service carrier within a low-cost model.

Founded in 1927 as a scheduled air mail and passenger service operating between Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba, the airline became a major company credited with many innovations that shaped the international airline industry, including the widespread use of jet aircraft, jumbo jets, and computerized reservation systems. It was also a founding member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global airline industry association. Identified by its blue globe logo ("The Blue Meatball"), the use of the word "Clipper" in aircraft names and call signs, and the white pilot uniform caps, the airline was a cultural icon of the 20th century. In an era dominated by flag carriers that were wholly or majority government-owned, it was also the unofficial overseas flag carrier of the United States. During most of the jet era, Pan Am's flagship terminal was the Worldport located at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Nordica is the state-owned Estonian flag carrier headquartered in Tallinn and based at Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport. It is the largest air carrier at Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport. The airline was formed after the 2015 bankruptcy of the previous flag carrier Estonian Air. Since most of the flights are marketed by LOT Polish Airlines, which owns 49% of the shares and a member of the Star Alliance, Nordica also carries LOT's flight codes and callsign on most of its flights. Through its subsidiary Regional Jet in a partnership with Scandinavian Airlines, Regional Jet operates four ATR72-600s between Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, Billund, Goteborg, Hanover and other SK destinations.

A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent, also known as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution. Forwarders contract with a carrier or often multiple carriers to move the goods. A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in the logistics network. These carriers can use a variety of shipping modes, including ships, airplanes, trucks, and railroads, and often multiple modes for a single shipment.

In general usage, a financial plan is a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's current pay and future financial state by using current known variables to predict future income, asset values and withdrawal plans. This often includes a budget which organizes an individual's finances and sometimes includes a series of steps or specific goals for spending and saving in the future. This plan allocates future income to various types of expenses, such as rent or utilities, and also reserves some income for short-term and long-term savings. A financial plan is sometimes referred to as an investment plan, but in personal finance a financial plan can focus on other specific areas such as risk management, estates, college, or retirement. An impresario (from the Italian "impresa", "an enterprise or undertaking") is a person who organizes and often finances concerts, plays, or operas, performing a role similar to that of an artist manager or a film or television producer. The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season. The owners of the theatre, usually noble amateurs, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk. In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce "Der Schauspieldirektor" ("The Impresario"). Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera "Orlando finto pazzo" was followed by numerous others.

He notably sang in the world premieres of two operas by Samuel Barber at the Met: "Vanessa" (1958) and "Antony and Cleopatra" (1966). He also sang in the company premieres of "Die Frau ohne Schatten" (1966), "Billy Budd" (1978) and "L'enfant et les sortilèges" (1981). Although Nagy specialized in supporting roles, he also portrayed several leading parts at the Met, among them Florestan in "Fidelio", Herodes in "Salome", and the Drum Major in "Wozzeck'. He remained on the Met roster through the end of the 1987–88 season, performing 1,187 performances with the Met during his thirty years with the company.

**Question:** Who was involved in the arrest of Dread Pirate Roberts?
**Answer:** Christopher "Chris" Tarbell

**Context:**
The Dread Crew of Oddwood is an acoustic pirate band from San Diego, California. Their music, referred to by the band as "Heavy Mahogany", is characterized by a pirate theme and heavy use of acoustic instruments. Bartholomew Roberts (17 May 1682 – 10 February 1722), born John Roberts, was a Welsh pirate who raided ships off the Americas and West Africa between 1719 and 1722. He was the most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy as measured by vessels captured, taking over 400 prizes in his career. He is also known as Black Bart (Welsh: "Barti Ddu" ), but this name was never used in his lifetime. He is sometimes confused with Charles Bolles, called the "Black Bart" of the American West. Pirate radio in Ireland has had a long history, with hundreds of radio stations having operated from within the country. Due to past lax enforcement of the rules, the lack of commercial radio until 1989, and the small physical size of the country, pirate radio has proliferated up to recent years. They were tolerated to a point by the government which only occasionally raided them in an effort to show compliance with Irish law, although the national broadcaster, RTÉ, took a harsher approach, including radio jamming. Mayo man Jack Sean McNeela in 1940 died on Hunger strike in Arbour Hill Military Detention Barracks after 55 days protesting his arrest for operating a pro IRA pirate radio station. Christopher "Chris" Tarbell is a former FBI special agent who infiltrated both Anonymous and the Silk Road. He was involved in the tracking and arrest of both Sabu (of Anonymous) and Dread Pirate Roberts of Silk Road (Ross Ulbricht). He turned Sabu into an informant against the hacker group Lulzsec. He later led the team that led to the arrest of Ross Ulbricht in the Glen Park Public Library. The Dread Pirate Roberts is a fictional character in the novel "The Princess Bride" (1973) and its 1987 film adaptation. Pirate decryption most often refers to the decryption, or decoding, of pay TV or pay radio signals without permission from the original broadcaster. The term "pirate" in this case is used in the sense of copyright infringement and has little or nothing to do with sea piracy, nor with pirate radio, which involved the operation of a small broadcast radio station without lawfully obtaining a license to transmit. The MPAA and other groups which lobby in favour of intellectual property (specifically copyright and trademark) regulations have labelled such decryption as "signal theft" even though there is no direct tangible loss on the part of the original broadcaster, arguing that losing out on a potential chance to profit from a consumer's subscription fees counts as a loss of actual profit. Christopher Moore was a co-founder of the offshore pirate radio ship Radio Caroline, and the first voice to be heard on the air from that station. His opening words were "This is Radio Caroline on 199, your all-day music station". The first song played was by The Rolling Stones. At its peak in 1967, the station had 23 million listeners, and it revolutionized radio broadcasting in the UK. In 1991 Moore was interviewed extensively in the BBC TV show A Pirate's Tale, where he described his key role in detail. Moore is a member of the Pirate Radio Hall of Fame. Moore, who had variously been a club DJ, merchant naval steward, and photographer had become involved in Radio Caroline when he met the station's founder Ronan O'Rahilly. Moore's Chelsea flat mate Ian Ross (later a novelist) introduced O'Rahilly to his father New Zealand born Charles Ross, who in turn helped O'Rahilly raise the £250,000 needed to start what became Britain's first pirate radio station in April 1964. <> http://www.flashesandflames.com/2014/03/how-a-radio-ship-and-7-men-shook-up-britain-50-years-ago/</.> Although Chris Moore was the first voice to be heard on Radio Caroline, the first programme was hosted by Simon Dee who subsequently became a TV chat show host of Dee Time on the BBC. Ross William Ulbricht (born March 27, 1984) is a former darknet market operator, best known for being convicted of creating and running the Silk Road website until his arrest.

Trigiani has published a novel a year since 2000. Great Eastern Conventions, Inc. was an entertainment company which produced comic book conventions, most actively during the years 1987-1996. In New York City, the Great Eastern shows filled the gap between the mid-1980s demise of the annual Comic Art Convention and Creation Conventions, and the establishment of promoter Michael Carbonaro's annual Big Apple Comic Con in 1996. From 1993–1995, Great Eastern hosted two New York City shows annually at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Great Eastern also ran shows in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, Minnesota, and Texas. The New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City. There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad " The Union Connecting". Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built.

**Question:** Who was born first, Andy Warhol or Alexander Butler?
**Answer:** Alexander Butler

**Context:**
Alexander Butler was a British film director who made over sixty features and short films during the 1910s and 1920s including many for G.B. Samuelson's production company. Butler directed several British films in Hollywood in 1920, where Samuelson had made an arrangement with Universal Pictures. Amongst his notable films are the Sherlock Holmes adaptation "The Valley of Fear" (1916) and the early British horror film "The Beetle" (1919). Andy Warhol ( ; born Andrew Warhola; August 6, 1928 – February 22, 1987) was an American artist, director and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art. His works explore the relationship between artistic expression, celebrity culture, and advertising that flourished by the 1960s, and span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening, photography, film, and sculpture. Some of his best known works include the silkscreen paintings "Campbell's Soup Cans" (1962) and "Marilyn Diptych" (1962), the experimental film "Chelsea Girls" (1966), and the multimedia events known as the "Exploding Plastic Inevitable" (1966–67). John Warhola (May 31, 1925 – December 24, 2010) played a pivotal role in maintaining the legacy of his younger brother, pop artist Andy Warhol, assigned responsibility by their father on his deathbed to ensure that Andy attended college and serving as a trustee of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts after his brother's death in 1987. Warhola oversaw the establishment of The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce, Slovakia. Empire is a 1964 American black and white silent film written, produced, and directed by Andy Warhol. It consists of eight hours and five minutes of continuous slow motion footage of the Empire State Building in New York City. Abridged showings of the film were never allowed, and supposedly the unwatchability of the film was an important part of the reason the film was created. However, a legitimate Italian VHS produced in association with the Andy Warhol Museum in 2000 contains only an extract of 60 minutes. Its use of the long take "in extremis" is an extension of Warhol's earlier work the previous year with "Sleep". Warhol employed Rob Trains to be the projectionist for a screening of the film. Trains miscalculated and mixed the order and speed of the reels for the eight-hour movie. After a positive review in "The New York Times", Warhol actually liked the "mistake" and employed Trains for the entire summer. I Shot Andy Warhol is a 1996 American-British independent film about the life of Valerie Solanas and her relationship with the artist Andy Warhol. The film marked the debut of Canadian director Mary Harron. The film stars Lili Taylor as Valerie, Jared Harris as Andy Warhol, and Martha Plimpton as Valerie's friend Stevie. Stephen Dorff plays Warhol superstar Candy Darling. John Cale of The Velvet Underground wrote the film's score despite protests from former band member Lou Reed. Yo La Tengo plays an anonymous band that is somewhat reminiscent of the group. Green Coca-Cola Bottles is a 1962 painting by Andy Warhol that depicts numerous Coca-Cola bottles. Andy Warhol’s painting “Green Coca-Cola Bottles” attempted to take a mainstream item and converted it into a piece of art. Warhol’s piece was a hybrid craft that is to say that he utilized a silkscreen technique, which mechanicalized some aspects of the painting, but also kept it so that he had to put in some of his individualized “unevenness” across the painting, to reel in the human aspect. The painting engenders an optimistic message for the American public, which is best described in Warhol’s own words, “What’s grand about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same thing as the poorest... you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and, just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke.” Here Warhol goes to show that the democratic equality, which allowed the birth of a uniformly governed consumerist mindset, has given them an equal satiating medium. With respect to its artistic merits, Warhol’s painting utilizes repetitive imagery in the shape of hundred and twelve almost identical bottles, evoking a sense of mechanicalization which overlaps his former usage of mass culture objects. The widespread display of advertisement flooded the American public during the sixties, and Warhol had been successful in mapping it onto his canvas, no wonder it is considered one of Warhol’s masterpieces. Beautiful Darling: The Life and Times of Candy Darling, Andy Warhol Superstar is a 2010 feature-length documentary film about Candy Darling, the transgender pioneer, actress and Andy Warhol Superstar. The film was written and directed by James Rasin and features Chloë Sevigny as "the voice of Candy Darling", reading from Candy's private diaries and letters. Patton Oswalt voices Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. Louis Durra composed the score. The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, sometimes simply called Plastic Inevitable or EPI, was a series of multimedia events organized by Andy Warhol between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by The Velvet Underground and Nico, screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's Factory, especially Mary Woronov and Gerard Malanga. "Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable" is also the title of an 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called "The Plastic Exploding Inevitable" as part of the "Aspen" No. 3 package. The Night Riders is a 1920 British silent western film directed by Alexander Butler and starring Maudie Dunham, Albert Ray and Alexander Butler. It was one of several films made by the British producer G.B. Samuelson at Universal City in California. A Cornish emigrant to Canada battles against cattle rustlers in Alberta. The Andy Warhol Story (1966) is an underground film directed by Andy Warhol with cinematography by Paul Morrissey, and starring Edie Sedgwick and Rene Ricard (as Andy Warhol).

**Question:** Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle and Snoop Dogg's Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp are hip-hop music videos that feature what film genre?
**Answer:** hardcore pornography

**Context:**
Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle is a mixed hardcore pornography and hip-hop music video featuring the music of rapper Snoop Dogg and presented by him. It was released in 2001. It was the first hardcore video ever listed on the Billboard music video sales chart. Because of its huge success, it started a trend where rappers are put into the mainstream of the porn industry by hosting X-rated movies. Many films of the genre followed, starring Necro, Mystikal, Too Short, Ice-T and Yukmouth. It also allowed Hustler to expand its boundaries by launching new subsidiaries for their recently formed fashion line and CD label. The scenes were shot at Snoop Dogg's house in Claremont, California. Snoop Dogg himself however, does not appear nude or perform any explicit acts. Snoop Dogg's Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp is a mixed hardcore pornography and hip hop music video featuring the music of rapper Snoop Dogg, produced by Hustler Video. The video was also directed, co-produced and presented by Snoop, although he does not feature in any sex scenes. In the films credits, Snoop is listed under the moniker "Snoop Scorsese". The movie was released in 2002, a year after Snoop Dogg set the trend of mixed hip hop porn movies with "Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle". Doggystyle is the debut studio album by American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. It was released on November 23, 1993, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. The album was recorded and produced following Snoop's appearances on Dr. Dre's debut solo album "The Chronic" (1992), to which Snoop contributed significantly. The West Coast style in hip-hop that he developed from Dre's first album continued on "Doggystyle". Critics have praised Snoop Doggy Dogg for the lyrical "realism" that he delivers on the album and for his distinctive vocal flow. Despite some mixed criticism of the album initially upon its release, "Doggystyle" earned recognition from many music critics as one of the most significant albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the most important hip-hop albums ever released. Much like "The Chronic", the distinctive sounds of "Doggystyle" helped introduce the hip-hop subgenre of g-funk to a mainstream audience, bringing forward West Coast hip hop as a dominant force in the early-1990s. Diary of a G is the eleventh studio album from rapper Mr. Capone-E released on August 25, 2009 through his own record label Hi-Power Entertainment. Mr. Capone-E produced Diary of a G with co-producer Fingazz. Diary of a G is a two-disc set with the album plus the DVD; the DVD shows all the steps Mr. Capone-E takes to make the album. The DVD features artists such as Lil Eazy-E, Lil Rob, Snoop Dogg, The Game, Mr. Criminal, Prima J, (Boxer) Amrkhan, and more. The album features artist's such as Snoop Dogg, Mr. Criminal, Fingazz, The Game, Glasses Malone, Birdman, and more. Including the single "Light My Fire" featuring Snoop Dogg & Fingazz. "Game Don't Wait" was the second single released from Warren G's third album, "I Want It All". The remix of the song, which was the version released as a single was produced by Warren G's stepbrother Dr. Dre and featured fellow 213 members, Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg, as well as Xzibit. It peaked at 58 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. The original song was produced by Warren G and featured Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, but Xzibit was exclusive to the remix. Meech Wells (born Cecil D. Womack, Jr.) is a music producer from the United States. He works primarily on hip hop music, and has produced or co-produced for artists Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal. Wells is also the son of Motown singer Mary Wells and musician/songwriter, Cecil Womack. Being the son of Motown legend Mary Wells may have helped jumpstart Meech Wells' career, but the West Coast rap producer quickly proved his talent and eventually aligned himself with Snoop Dogg, another relationship that definitely didn't hurt his career. Before being Snoop's producer of choice during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wells began his career as part of a funk band called Trey Lewd that also featured Tracey Lewis, George Clinton's son; this provided him with the opportunity to work with Clinton himself. By 1993, Wells found himself working alongside producer/rapper Def Jef; the two's production on Shaquille O'Neil's "I Got Skillz" (a surprise hit single) won them instant credentials. Throughout the mid-'90s, he continued to hone his craft, working on a number of remix projects before eventually being introduced to Snoop through a friend. Before long, the two were working together as a potent duo, beginning with "Still a G Thang," one of the better songs on Snoop's Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told. Wells produced a few No Limit songs featuring Snoop—Tru's "It's a Beautiful Thang," Silkk the Shocker's "Get It Up"—before playing a major role in bringing a West Coast sound to Snoop's Top Dogg album in 1999: "In Love With a Thug," "Better Days," "Gangsta Ride," among others. In 2000 he reprised his role as one of Snoop's producers of choice, producing tracks for Tha Eastsidaz' self-titled debut and Doggy's Angels' Pleezbalevit, as well as Snoop's own Tha Last Meal ("Go Away," "Issues"). Stanley Harris Jr. (born in Santa Ana, California, U.S.) is a music producer, rapper and singer in Los Angeles, California. He records under the stage name Quaze or Quazedelic. He received his big break into the music industry when rapper Snoop Dogg signed him to Doggystyle Records in 2001. He is most recognized for his funk music style production. His first major release with the Doggystyle Records crew was on the soundtrack of Undercover Brother, where he produced the single, Give Up the Funk. The song featured Snoop Dogg, Bootsy Collins, Fred Wesley, Kokane and Quazedelic. Later he went on to work with many other Hip-Hop and R&B artists like Angie Stone, Baby Bash, G-Unit, Dub C, Redman, Suga Free and Goldie Loc from the Eastsidaz. "Snoop Dogg (What's My Name II)" is the follow-up for one of the first singles released by rapper Snoop Dogg, "Who Am I? (What's My Name?) ." It was also the only CD single released from his fifth album, "Tha Last Meal". The music video is directed by Chris Robinson. It was produced by Timbaland and briefly features Dr. Dre, who is sat on a couch portrayed as a pimp with Snoop Dogg to his left. Nate Dogg and Lady of Rage provide vocals in the chorus. Dead Man Walkin' is a compilation album released by Death Row Records on October 31, 2000, composed of archived Snoop Dogg recordings but was not authorized by Snoop Dogg, nor recognized on the discography on his website. Snoop Dogg was an artist on Death Row from 1992 to 1998, when he left the label following labelmate Dr. Dre's departure and the death of Tupac Shakur. The split between Snoop Dogg and Death Row head Suge Knight was less than amicable, and the title of this release was an unfriendly warning from Knight to Snoop Dogg, who had spoken out against the imposing Knight in several interviews and on record as well. According to SoundScan (2005), it has sold 220,478 copies. A music video was released for Head Doctor. Coolaid is the fourteenth studio album by American West Coast hip hop recording artist Snoop Dogg. It was released on July 1, 2016, by Doggystyle Records and eOne Music. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2015 to 2016 at the Doggystyle Studios Records, in Diamond Bar, California. The production on the album was handled by Snoop Dogg and other record producers, including Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz and Timbaland. Snoop Dogg also enlisted a variety of guest vocalists such as Too $hort, Swizz Beatz, Jeremih, Wiz Khalifa, Trick Trick, E-40, Jazze Pha, Suga Free and October London, among others.

**Question:** Does the genus Cunninghamia or Chilopsis contain only one species?
**Answer:** Chilopsis

**Context:**
Nomascus is the second-most speciose genus of gibbons (family Hylobatidae). Originally, this genus was a subgenus of "Hylobates", and all individuals were considered one species, "Hylobates concolor". Species within "Nomascus" are characterized by 52 chromosomes. Some species are all black, some are light with a distinct black tuft of crown fur, and some have distinct, light-colored cheek patches. "Nomascus" is found from southern China (Yunnan) to southern Vietnam, and also on Hainan Island. One species, "Nomascus nasutus," has been deemed "the most critically endangered ape species in the world". All species in this genus are endangered or critically endangered. Bupleurum is a large genus of annual or perennial herbs or woody shrubs, with about one hundred and ninety species, belonging to the Apiaceae family. The full size of its species may vary between a few cm to up to 3 m high. Their compound umbels of small flowers are adorned with bracteoles that are sometimes large and may play a role in attracting pollinators. Rare among Apiaceae are the simple leaves, bracts (if present) and bracteoles. The genus is almost exclusively native in the Old World Northern Hemisphere, with one species native to North America and one species native to southern Africa. Pseudopontia is a genus of butterflies found only in wet forests of tropical Africa. It is the only genus in the subfamily Pseudopontiinae. It was traditionally thought to contain only one species (monotypic), "Pseudopontia paradoxa". However, a recent study showed there are at least five species of "Pseudopontia" which can be distinguished genetically and by details of wing veins. Each is found primarily in a different part of Africa, though several of the species have overlapping geographic distributions. Anthocharis is a Holarctic genus of the butterfly tribe Anthocharini, in the Pieridae family. These are typically small, white-hued butterflies that have colorful marks just inside the tips of the forewings. The tip colors are usually a red-orange hue, hence the name "orange tip". The larvae of these butterfly often consume cruciferous plants containing chemicals called glucosinolates. This genus is characterized by two of the five subcostal veins branching off before the apex of the cell, by the upper radial being only little united with the subcostal, and by the central discocellular being rather long. In all the species the males have at least the apical portion of the forewing orange red or yellow. Only one species inhabits also the northern districts of the Palearctic region, all the others are found in the south of the Palearctic region, also some species occur in North America, but not one species extends into the tropics. The Anthocharis species have only one brood. The butterflies occur in spring. Chilopsis is a monotypic genus of flowering plants containing the single species Chilopsis linearis. Megacheira ("Great Hands") is an extinct class of predatory arthropods that possessed a pair of short enlarged appendages (the source of the class' name). They strongly resemble early chelicerates. Most of them were found in marine environments throughout the world from the lower to middle Cambrian. The group might also contain one species ("Enalikter aphson") described from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte of the United Kingdom, and one species ("Bundenbachiellus giganteus") known from the Early Devonian of Germany; however, the interpretation of these taxa as megacheirans was challenged by Struck "et al." (2015). Megacheirans were important components of several faunas, including the Burgess, Wheeler and Maotianshan Shales Lagerstatten. Genera referred to the class include "Leanchoilia", "Alalcomenaeus", "Oestokerkus", "Yohoia", "Fortiforceps" and "Jianfengia". The giraffe ("Giraffa") is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. The genus currently consists of one species, "Giraffa camelopardalis", the type species. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of "Giraffa," but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies. Oligoryzomys fulvescens, also known as the fulvous colilargo, fulvous pygmy rice rat, or northern pygmy rice rat, is a species of rodent in the genus "Oligoryzomys" of family Cricetidae. It is found from southern Mexico through Central America into South America, where it occurs south into Peru and Brazil, and includes numerous synonyms, including the type species of the genus, "Oryzomys navus" Bangs, 1899. The taxonomy of this species is unresolved, and it may be found to contain more than one species. Its karyotype has 2n = 54-60 and FNa = 68-74. Argyrochosma is a genus of ferns known commonly as false cloak ferns. The genus is included in the Cheilanthoideae subfamily of the Pteridaceae. Species now in this genus were previously treated as members of related genera "Notholaena" or "Pellaea" but were segregated into their own genus in 1987. These ferns, of which there are about 20 species, are mostly native to the Americas, from North to South and including the Caribbean, while one species, "A. connectens", is known from Sichuan, China. They are commonly found growing in cracks between rocks. Their leaves are generally shorter than 40 centimeters and have rounded bluish or grayish green segments. Often the lower surface of the segments is coated in a white dust, and the sporangia contain brown spores. Cunninghamia is a genus of one or two living species of evergreen coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae. They are native to China, northern Vietnam and Laos, and perhaps also Cambodia. They may reach 50 m in height. In vernacular use, it is most often known as "Cunninghamia", but is also sometimes called "China-fir" (though it is not a fir). The genus name "Cunninghamia" honours Dr. James Cunningham, a British doctor who introduced this species into cultivation in 1702 and botanist Allan Cunningham.

**Question:** The Carnaval del Pueblo is Eurpoe's largest celebration of what expression of the people of Latin America?
**Answer:** Latin American culture

**Context:**
The Party for the Government of the People (PGP)—in Spanish: "Partido por el Gobierno del Pueblo"—was a social democratic political party in Uruguay. It was originally the "Movimiento por el Gobierno del Pueblo". MGP was formed in 1962 by Zelmar Michelini, initially as a group inside the "Partido Colorado." La Voz del Pueblo ('People's Voice') was a socialist weekly newspaper from Santander, Spain, published as a regional organ of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party in Cantabria 1898-1905. The newspaper was printed on Sundays. "La Voz del Pueblo" was the first socialist newspaper in the province. Isidoro Acevedo, Manuel Olivero and Álvaro Ortiz were the directors of "La Voz del Pueblo". From October 15, 1899 (its 62nd issue) onwards "La Voz del Pueblo" was edited at the workshop of the daily "El Cantábrico", at Calle de la Compañía. The Summer Carnaval (Dutch: Zomercarnaval) is an annual event in the Belgian city of Kortrijk and the Dutch cities Rotterdam, Bentelo and Arnhem that mimics the Carnaval of Latin America and the Cape Verde Islands. The traditional pre-Lent Carnival falls in winter in the cool, northern European climate. This climate does not lend itself to celebrating carnival in the Latin American and Cape Verde manner. The Summer Carnival offers people an opportunity to celebrate Carnival in such a manner. The Arnhem Rio on the Rhine attracted more than 150.000 visitors, while the Rotterdam event attracts nearly a million visitors yearly. Summer Carnaval is often compared to Karneval der Kulturen (Berlin) and Notting Hill Carnival (London). In 2001 the Carnival was honoured with the prestigious Dutch Prince Claus Award, for their work in promoting the positive contribution of Antillean culture to Dutch society. Mario Roberto Santucho (August 12, 1936 in Santiago del Estero – July 19, 1976 in Villa Martelli) was an Argentine revolutionary and guerrilla combatant, founder of the Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores (Workers' Revolutionary Party, PRT) and leader of Argentina's largest marxist guerrilla group, the Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (People's Revolutionary Army, ERP). Latin American culture is the formal or informal expression of the people of Latin America, and includes both high culture (literature, high art) and unpopular culture (music, folk art and dance) as well as religion and other customary practices. Latin America also has many races. There are 53 prisons in Bolivia which incarcerate around 8,700 people as of 2010. The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate (Spanish: "Dirección de Régimen Penintenciario" ). There are 17 prisons in departmental capital cities and 36 provincial prisons. According to the Defensor del Pueblo and a source in the Directorate, approximately three-quarters of prisoners have yet to receive their sentences, and are either awaiting trial, or presently on trial; the Defensor del Pueblo considers these people deprived of their right to liberty. Overcrowding is at a serious level, with the total prison population at three times the capacity of the prisons. An investigative survey by the Defensor del Pueblo of 20 rural prisons found that they lack the basic infrastructure necessary to function humanely. The Ombudsman's Office of Colombia (Spanish: "Defensoría del Pueblo" ) is the national government agency that is charged with overseeing the protection of civil and human rights within the legal framework of the Republic of Colombia. The ombudsman, or People's Defender (Spanish: "Defensor del Pueblo" ), is an official appointed by the President, and elected by the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia, to head this agency. La Voz del Pueblo (English: People's Voice ) was a liberal weekly newspaper published from Bogotá, Colombia in 1849. The first issue of the newspaper was published on January 7, 1849. It came out on Sundays. The newspaper was identified with the opposition against the incumbent government. The ninth, and last, issue of "La Voz del Pueblo" came out on March 4, 1849. The People's Democratic Party (Spanish: "Partido Democrático del Pueblo" ) was a political party in Chile. It was founded through a split in the Democratic Party. PDP was part of the 1952 People's Alliance that supported Carlos Ibáñez del Campo in the 1952 presidential election. In 1956 the PDP joined the Popular Action Front (FRAP). In 1956 PDP merged again into the Democratic Party. The Carnaval del Pueblo is Europe's largest celebration of Latin American culture, held in Burgess Park, London in the first week of August.

**Question:** The king of the Molossians and Epirus encamped between what two cities?
**Answer:** Pandosia and Heraclea

**Context:**
East Palo Alto (abbreviated E.P.A.) is a city in San Mateo County, California, United States. As of the 2010 census, the population of East Palo Alto was 28,155. It is situated on the San Francisco Peninsula, roughly halfway between the cities of San Francisco and San Jose. To the north and east is the San Francisco Bay, to the west is the city of Menlo Park, and to the south the city of Palo Alto. Despite being called "East" Palo Alto, this is a misnomer, as the city is precisely due north of Palo Alto. While often incorrectly assumed to be part of the city of Palo Alto, East Palo Alto has always been a separate entity since its founding as an unincorporated community. It is also in San Mateo County, while Palo Alto is in Santa Clara County. The two cities are separated only by San Francisquito Creek and, largely, the Bayshore Freeway (the vast majority of East Palo Alto is northeast of the freeway, while all of the residential part of Palo Alto is southwest of the freeway). The revitalization projects in 2000, and high income high-tech professionals moving into new developments, including employees from Google and Facebook, have begun to eliminate the cultural and economic differences between the two cities. East Palo Alto and Palo Alto share both telephone area codes and postal ZIP codes. Pyrrhus ( ; Πύρρος , "Pyrrhos"; 319/318–272 BC) was a Greek general and statesman of the Hellenistic period. He was king of the Greek tribe of Molossians, of the royal Aeacid house (from c. 297 BC), and later he became king of Epirus (r. 306–302, 297–272 BC). He was one of the strongest opponents of early Rome. Some of his battles, though successful, caused him heavy losses, from which the term "Pyrrhic victory" was coined. He is the subject of one of Plutarch's "Parallel Lives". La Esperanza (] ) is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibucá, Honduras. The city of La Esperanza is merged indistinguishably with the city of Intibucá, the head of the neighbouring municipality of Intibucá. Intibucá is the older of the two cities and was originally a Lenca community, while La Esperanza is the newer ladino community. The two cities, often called the twin cities, while distinct with separate municipal governments, are generally referred to jointly as La Esperanza and are separated only by a street that crosses town. Pandosia (Greek: Πανδοσία ) was an ancient town of Lucania (now Basilicata), Italy, situated near Heraclea. It has often been confounded with Pandosia in Bruttium; but the distinct existence of a Lucanian town of the name is clearly established by two authorities. Plutarch describes Pyrrhus as encamping in the plain between Pandosia and Heraclea, with the river Siris (modern Sinni) in front of him; and the celebrated "Tabulae Heracleenses" repeatedly refer to the existence of a town of the name in the immediate neighborhood of Heraclea. From these notices we may infer that it was situated at a very short distance from Heraclea, but apparently further inland; and its site has been fixed with some probability at a spot called , about 11 km from the sea, and 6.5 km from Heraclea. Deidamia or Deidameia (Greek: Δηϊδάμεια ) or Laodamia (Greek: Λαοδάμεια ) (died c. 233 BC) was a Greek princess, daughter of Pyrrhus II of Epirus, king of Epirus. After the death of her father and that of her uncle Ptolemy, she was the last surviving representative of the royal Aeacid dynasty in Epirus. She had a sister, Nereis, who married Gelo of Syracuse. During a rebellion in Epirus her sister sent her 800 mercenaries from Gaul. Part of the Molossians supported her, and with the aid of the mercenaries she briefly took Ambracia. The Epirotes, however, determined to secure their liberty by extirpating the whole royal family, resolved to put her to death; she fled for refuge to the temple of Artemis, but was murdered in the sanctuary itself by Milo, a man already responsible of matricide, who shortly after this crime committed suicide. The date of this event cannot be accurately fixed, but it occurred during the reign of Demetrius II in Macedonia (239–229 BC), and probably in the early part of it. In Greek mythology, Molossus (Greek: Μολοσσός) was the son of Neoptolemus and Andromache. He was the eponymous founder of the Molossians, an ancient Greek tribe that inhabited the region of Epirus located in northwestern Greece. Molossus had two brothers, Pielus and Pergamus (the latter named after the citadel of Troy), who were also sons of Neoptolemus and Andromache. Beroea of Epirus (Ancient Greek Βέροια) was an ancient Greek princess of the tribe of the Molossians, that was married to the Illyrian king Glaukias. She raised Pyrrhus of Epirus. Aidoneus (Gr. Ἀїδωνεύς ) was a mythical king of the Molossians in Epirus, who is represented as the husband of Persephone. After Theseus, with the assistance of Pirithous, concealed Helen at Aphidnae, he went to Epirus to procure for Pirithous Kore, the daughter of Aidoneus, as a reward. When Aidoneus discovered that they had come with the intention of carrying off his daughter, he had Pirithous killed by Cerberus, and kept Theseus in captivity, who was afterwards released at the request of Heracles. Eusebius calls the wife of Aidoneus a daughter of queen Demeter, with whom he had eloped. Thus the story of Aidoneus is the legend of Hades' rape of Persephone, in the form of a real-world history, and is undoubtedly the work of a late interpreter of ancient myths. The Woodland Davis Clean Water Agency (WDCWA) is a joint project between the cities of Woodland and Davis in Yolo County, California; also in partnership with Reclamation District 2035. This agency will oversee the construction and management of the facility that will pump water from the Sacramento River to the two cities. This new facility is to provide reliable water supply, improve the water quality for drinking purposes, and improve the treated wastewater discharge from the two cities. This new facility is expected to be supplying the cities with clean surface water in June 2016. Lanassa was a daughter of king Agathocles of Syracuse, Sicily, perhaps by his second wife Alcia. In 295 BC Agathocles married Lanassa to King Pyrrhus of Epirus. Agathocles himself escorted his daughter with his fleet to Epirus to her groom. Lanassa brought the island of Corcyra as dowry into the marriage. The couple had two sons: Alexander and Helenus. However, Lanassa could not accept her husband's polygamous lifestyle, and so she left Pyrrhus in 291 BC, went to Corcyra, and offered this island as dowry to Demetrius I Poliorcetes, then king of Macedonia, if he would become her new husband. The courted diadoch came to Corcyra, married Lanassa and occupied the island. After the death of Agathocles (289 BC) Pyrrhus, as former husband of Lanassa, asserted hereditary claims to Sicily. On the basis of these claims the inhabitants of Syracuse asked Pyrrhus in 279 BC for assistance against Carthage.

**Question:** What role in the military did the discoverer of the elliptical galaxy NGC 3610 have before reaching Britain ?
**Answer:** Military Band of Hanover,

**Context:**
NGC 4458 is an elliptical galaxy located about 54 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo. It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 12, 1784. NGC 4458 is a member of Markarian's Chain which is part of the Virgo Cluster. It is in a pair with the galaxy NGC 4461. NGC 4458 and NGC 4461 are both Interacting with each other. NGC 3226 is a dwarf elliptical galaxy that is interacting with the spiral galaxy NGC 3227. The two galaxies are one of several examples of a spiral with a dwarf elliptical companion that are listed in the "Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies". Both galaxies may be found in the constellation Leo. Frederick William Herschel, (German: "Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel" ; 15 November 1738 – 25 August 1822) was a British astronomer and composer of German and Czech-Jewish origin, and brother of fellow astronomer Caroline Herschel, with whom he worked. Born in the Electorate of Hanover, Herschel followed his father into the Military Band of Hanover, before migrating to Great Britain in 1757 at the age of nineteen. NGC 7331 (also known as Caldwell 30) is a unbarred spiral galaxy about 40 e6ly away in the constellation Pegasus. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 7331 is the brightest member of the NGC 7331 Group of galaxies. The other members of the group are the lenticular or unbarred spirals NGC 7335 and 7336, the barred spiral galaxy NGC 7337 and the elliptical galaxy NGC 7340. These galaxies lie at distances of approximately 332, 365, 348 and 294 million light years, respectively. In both visible light and infrared photos of the NGC 7331, the core of the galaxy appears to be slightly off-center, with one side of the disk appearing to extend further away from the core than the opposite side. The NGC 68 galaxy group is a cluster of at least 40 galaxies around the elliptical galaxy NGC 68. The main group was discovered in 1784 by William Herschel, who listed the galaxies as a single object. Later, in the 1880s, John Louis Emil Dreyer managed to discern the main galaxies and cataloged them each as NGC 68, NGC 70, and NGC 71. NGC 71 is an Elliptical galaxy (or possibly a Lenticular galaxy) in the constellation Andromeda. It is in the NGC 68 group. The galaxy was discovered by R. J. Mitchell in 1855, and observed in 1865 by Heinrich d'Arrest, who described it as "extremely faint, very small, round". The galaxy is about 110,000-130,000 light years across, making it just slightly larger than the Milky Way. The galaxy is the second largest in the NGC 68 group, after spiral galaxy NGC 70. NGC 2276 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Cepheus. The galaxy lies 105 million light-years away from Earth. NGC 2276 has an asymmetrical appearance, most likely caused by gravitational interactions with its neighbor, elliptical galaxy NGC 2300. One of the many starburst spiral arms contains an intermediate mass black hole with 50,000 times the mass of the Sun, named NGC 2276-3c. NGC 2276-3c has produced two jets: a large-scale radio jet, approximately 2,000 light years long, and an "inner jet" about 6 light years long. The galaxy shows an enhanced rate of star formation that may have been triggered by a collision with a dwarf galaxy, or by the gravitational interaction with its neighbor compressing gas and dust. NGC 3610 is an elliptical galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered on 8 April 1793 by William Herschel. NGC 3227 is an intermediate spiral galaxy that is interacting with the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 3226. The two galaxies are one of several examples of a spiral with a dwarf elliptical companion that are listed in the "Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies". Both galaxies may be found in the constellation Leo. NGC 7002 is a large elliptical galaxy around 320 million Light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Indus. The galaxy was discovered by English astronomer John Herschel on September 30, 1834. NGC 7002 is also part of a group of galaxies that contains the nearby galaxy NGC 7004.

**Question:** What animal does Mahratta Greyhound and Tibetan Spaniel have in common?
**Answer:** dog

**Context:**
The Tibetan Spaniel is a breed of assertive, small, intelligent dogs originating over 2,500 years ago in the Himalayan mountains of Tibet. They share ancestry with the Pekingese, Japanese Chin, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terrier and Pug. The Sussex Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in Sussex in southern England. It is a low, compact spaniel and is similar in appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, as well as a specific range of heart conditions and spinal disc herniation. Tibetan rug making is an ancient, traditional craft. Tibetan rugs are traditionally made from Tibetan highland sheep's wool, called "changpel". Tibetans use rugs for many purposes ranging from flooring to wall hanging to horse saddles, though the most common use is as a seating carpet. A typical sleeping carpet measuring around 3 x is called a "khaden". The Mahratta Greyhound or Maratha Greyhound is a dog breed originating in India. Thukpa bhatuk is a common Tibetan cuisine noodle soup that includes small bhasta noodles. This dish is a common soup made in the winter but is especially important for Tibetan New Year. On Nyi-Shu-Gu, the eve of Losar (Tibetan New Year), the common Tibetan soup, Thukpa bhatuk is made with special ingredients to form Guthuk. Guthuk is then eaten on Losar to symbolise getting rid of negativities of the past year and invite positives into the new year. The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family. Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused. The kiang ("Equus kiang") is the largest of the wild asses. It is native to the Tibetan Plateau, where it inhabits montane and alpine grasslands. Its current range is restricted to Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir, plains of the Tibetan plateau and northern Nepal along the Tibetan border. Other common names for this species include Tibetan wild ass, khyang and gorkhar. Greyhound Lines, Inc., usually shortened to Greyhound, is an intercity bus common carrier serving over 3,800 destinations across North America. The company's first route began in Hibbing, Minnesota in 1914, and the company adopted the name "The Greyhound Corporation" in 1929. Since October 2007, Greyhound has been a subsidiary of British transportation company FirstGroup, but continues to be based in Dallas, Texas, where it has been headquartered since 1987. Greyhound and sister companies in FirstGroup America are the largest motorcoach operators in the United States and Canada. The Southern Animal Rights Coalition (SARC) is an umbrella organisation for groups campaigning against animal abuse in southern England. SARC campaign on a variety of issues, one being focusing on pets. They also campaign against animal testing, furs, wild boar farms and more recently foie gras and greyhound racing. The group campaigns, investigates and exposes animal cruelty whilst promoting a cruelty-free lifestyle. Nyi Shu Gu is the eve before the last day of the Tibetan year (29th). It is celebrated with various traditions leading up to the Tibetan New Year: Losar. Guthuk is a common Tibetan cuisine noodle soup that is associated with Nyi Shu Gu. Thukpa bhatuk is the common style of noodle soup that becomes Guthuk when eaten with special ingredients and elements on Nyi Shu Gu. Nyi Shu Gu is a time to cleanse and bid adieu to negativities, obstacles, uncleanliness and sickness. A fire is traditional as is washing up. Evil spirits are sent away.

**Answer:** Al D'Amato

**Context:**
The 1942 United States Senate election in Montana took place on November 3, 1942. Incumbent United States Senator James E. Murray, who was first elected to the Senate in a special election in 1934 and was re-elected in 1936, ran for re-election. Following his victory in a competitive Democratic primary, Murray advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by former United States Attorney for the District of Montana Wellington D. Rankin, the Republican nominee and brother of representative Jeannette Rankin. In a closely fought election, Murray narrowly defeated Rankin to win re-election to his third term and his second full term in the Senate. The 1948 United States Senate election in Montana took place on November 2, 1948. Incumbent United States Senator James E. Murray, who was first elected to the Senate in a special election in 1934 and was re-elected in 1936 and 1942, ran for re-election. After winning the Democratic primary, he faced Tom J. Davis, an attorney and the Republican nominee, in the general election. Following a narrow re-election in 1936, Murray significantly expanded his margin of victory and comfortably won re-election over Davis, winning his fourth term and his third full term in the Senate. The 2004 United States Senate election in New York took place on November 2, 2004 along with elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as the presidential election, elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer won re-election to a second term with 71.2% of the vote, a then-record margin of victory for any statewide candidate in New York's history. The record was surpassed by Kirsten Gillibrand when she won re-election to a first full term in 2012 with 72% of the vote. The 1928 United States Senate election in Montana took place on November 6, 1928. Incumbent United States Senator Burton K. Wheeler, who was first elected to the Senate in 1922, ran for re-election. After successfully defeating several challengers in the Democratic primary, Wheeler advanced to the general election, where he faced Republican nominee Joseph M. Dixon, the former Governor of Montana who had previously served in the United States Senate from 1907 to 1913. Though the election was closer than Wheeler's first election, he still managed to defeat Dixon to win his second term in the Senate. Al Doty (born October 19, 1945) is a Minnesota politician and a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives who represented District 12B, which includes portions of Crow Wing and Morrison counties.

Charles Ellis Schumer ( ; born November 23, 1950) is an American politician, the senior United States senator from New York and a member of the Democratic Party. First elected in 1998, he defeated three-term Republican incumbent Al D'Amato 55% to 44%. Schumer was re-elected in 2004 with 71% of the vote, in 2010 with 66% of the vote, and in 2016 with 70% of the vote. The 2004 United States Senate election in Iowa was held on November 2, 2004. Incumbent Republican United States Senator Chuck Grassley ran for re-election to a fifth term in the United States Senate. Grassley and former State Senator Arthur A. Small won the Republican and Democratic primaries, respectively, unopposed, and faced each other in the general election. Though this election coincided with the highly competitive presidential election, Grassley was in little danger of losing his seat and defeated Small handily. The 1954 United States Senate election in Montana took place on November 2, 1954. Incumbent United States Senator James E. Murray, who was first elected to the Senate in a special election in 1934 and was re-elected in 1936, 1942, and 1948, ran for re-election. After winning the Democratic primary against trivial opponents, he advanced to the general election, where he was opposed by Wesley A. D'Ewart, the Republican nominee and the United States Congressman from Montana's 2nd congressional district. A contentious and close election ensued, but ultimately, Murray was able to narrowly win re-election over D'Ewart to a final term in the Senate. George McGovern, a Democratic Party politician from South Dakota, was first elected to the United States House of Representatives to represent South Dakota's 1st congressional district in 1956. He was re-elected in 1958, before making an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate in 1960 against Republican incumbent Karl Earl Mundt. After serving in the John F. Kennedy administration as director of the Food for Peace program, McGovern ran again for the Senate and narrowly prevailed over appointed Senator Joseph H. Bottum. In 1968, McGovern unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention and was re-elected to the Senate over former Governor of South Dakota Archie M. Gubbrud. In 1972, McGovern was successful in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, but lost the election in a landslide to incumbent President Richard Nixon. McGovern was re-elected to the Senate in 1974 over Vietnam War veteran Leo K. Thorsness, but lost re-election in 1980 to then-U.S. Representative James Abdnor. McGovern made a final unsuccessful run for president in United States presidential election, 1984. The 2004 United States Senate election in California took place on November 2, 2004 alongside other elections to the United States Senate in other states as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer ran for re-election and defeated Republican former Secretary of State Bill Jones. Boxer's 6.96 million votes set the all-time record for the most votes cast for one candidate in one state in one election, although it was surpassed by Senator Dianne Feinstein's 7.75 million votes in 2012.

William & Mary would go on to lose the game, 2–29. The 1953 William & Mary Indians football team represented William & Mary during the 1953 college football season. The team is considered, within the school's community, to be one of the most remarkable stories in its athletics history. Due to an academic cheating scandal (coincidentally unrelated to the 1951 scandal), eight of the team's starting members were dismissed from school and another portion of the remaining 33 players transferred out. Among the 24 remaining players, five were returning Korean War veterans and one other had never played a minute of football in his life. Many of them were undersized (the quarterback stood 5'8" and weighed 160 pounds) and even the coaching staff was few in numbers (five total, one of them being the head basketball coach). The 1957 William & Mary Indians football team represented William & Mary during the 1957 college football season.

**Question:** The Van cat's eyes have what feline form of complete heterochromia, a condition that occurs in some other animals?
**Answer:** odd-eyed

**Context:**
The Van cat (Turkish: "Van kedisi" ; Armenian: Վանա կատու "Vana katou" , Western Armenian: "Vana gadou"; Kurdish: "pisîka Wanê"‎ ) is a distinctive landrace of domestic cat, found in the Lake Van region of eastern Turkey. It is relatively large, has a chalky white coat, sometimes with ruddy coloration on the head and hindquarters, and has blue or amber eyes or is odd-eyed (having one eye of each colour). The variety has been referred to as "the swimming cat", and observed to swim in Lake Van. Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a broad term that is used to cover a number of conditions associated with the feline lower urinary tract. It may present as any of a variety of problems such as, inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) or urethra, formation of urinary crystals/stones in the bladder (crystalluria/urolithiasis), and partial or total obstruction of the urethra. The latter condition is also known as plugged-penis syndrome. Complete urethral obstruction is fatal if left untreated. Feline cystitis is associated with feline urological syndrome, feline lower urinary tract disease, and feline idiopathic cystitis. Feline cystitis means "inflammation of the bladder". The term "idiopathic" translates to unknown cause. This is because the direct cause of feline cystitis is unknown; however, certain behaviors have been known to aid the illness once it has been initiated. It can affect both males and females of any breed of cat. It is more commonly found in females cats; however, when males do exhibit cystitis, it is usually more dangerous. Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by "feline herpesvirus 1", of the family "Herpesviridae". It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition. Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats, FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide. The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is "feline calicivirus". In Hinduism, Budhi Pallien (pronounced BOO-dee PAL-ee-en) is a fearsome goddess of forests and jungles, who roams northern India, particularly Assam, in the form of a tiger. This wise goddess can change shape, from human to feline form and often travels with a companion tiger as she protects animals, with which she communicates. Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), also known as feline infectious enteritis, feline parvoviral enteritis, feline distemper, feline ataxia, or cat plague, is a viral infection affecting cats, both domesticated and wild feline species. It is caused by feline parvovirus, a close relative of both type 2 canine parvovirus and mink enteritis. Once contracted, it is highly contagious and can be fatal to the affected cat. The name panleukopenia comes from the low white blood cell count (leucocytes) exhibited by affected animals. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease that affects cats. It is caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which is a mutation of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) – (Feline coronavirus FCoV). Experts do not agree on the specifics of genetic changes that produce the FIPV. The mutated virus has the ability to invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages. The immune system's response causes an intense inflammatory reaction in the containing tissues. This disease is generally fatal. However, its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5,000 for households with one or two cats. A nasally administered vaccine for FIP is available but controversial, and it is not proven to be highly effective. An experimental polyprenyl immunostimulant is being manufactured by Sass and Sass and tested by Dr. Al Legendre, who described survival over 1 year in three cats diagnosed with FIP and treated with the medicine. In one case study, a female cat diagnosed with dry FIP has survived 26 months from the date of definitive diagnosis. Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending on the origin of the condition: Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called "juvenile diabetes", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Dogs can have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type of diabetes is Type 2. There is another less common form of diabetes, diabetes insipidus, which is a condition of insufficient antidiuretic hormone or resistance to it. An odd-eyed cat is a cat with one blue eye and one eye either green, yellow, or brown. This is a feline form of complete heterochromia, a condition that occurs in some other animals. The condition most commonly affects white-colored cats, but may be found in a cat of any color, provided that it possesses the white spotting gene. Feline Tooth Resorption (TR) is a syndrome in cats characterized by resorption of the tooth by odontoclasts, cells similar to osteoclasts. TR has also been called "feline odontoclastic resorption lesion" (FORL), neck lesion, cervical neck lesion, cervical line erosion, feline subgingival resorptive lesion, feline caries, or feline cavity. It is one of the most common diseases of domestic cats, affecting up to two-thirds. TRs have been seen more recently in the history of feline medicine due to the advancing ages of cats, but 800-year-old cat skeletons have shown evidence of this disease. Purebred cats, especially Siamese and Persians, may be more susceptible.

Douglas Tires are manufactured by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for Walmart only. Goodyear and Walmart started Douglas tire in 1992. Douglas tires are in many ways comparable to Kelly tires. As a private label tire, they are less expensive than actual brand-name tires. The down side to Douglas tires are more likely to have manufacturer defects compared to a Goodyear. F.A. Seiberling (October 6, 1859 – August 11, 1955) was an American inventor and founder. He is most famous for co-founding the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in 1898 and the Seiberling Rubber Company in 1921. He also built Stan Hywet Hall, a Tudor Revival mansion, now a National Historic Landmark and historic house museum in Akron, Ohio. The British League Riders Championship was an individual motorcycle speedway contest between the top riders (or two riders) with the highest average from each club competing in the British League in the UK, or the top division of the league during the period when it had two or more divisions. Similar tournaments had been held before the formation of the British League in 1965, including the Provincial League Riders' Championship, open to riders from the Provincial League. The championship has been sponsored by Player's No 10, Skol, Leyland Cars, Gauntlet, Daily Mirror, TNT Sameday and Dunlop Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915 (2011) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the connection between Goodyear and its subsidiaries with the state of North Carolina was not strong enough to establish general personal jurisdiction over the companies. Two 13-year-old boys from North Carolina died as a result of a bus accident outside of Paris. The parents of the boys believed the accident was due to a defective tire manufactured by a foreign subsidiary of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and sued for damages in a North Carolina state court. The foreign subsidiaries asserted that the North Carolina courts lacked jurisdiction over them and moved to dismiss. The North Carolina trial court denied the motion and the North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Question:** Who is the writer of this song that was inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set Back to Mono?
**Answer:** Phil Spector

**Context:**
Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands. This box set is similar to the earlier "Pebbles Box" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc. Supposedly, "the Trash Box" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records). However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on "Pebbles, Volume 4" have been eschewed entirely. Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the "Pebbles Box". Although most of the recordings on "the Trash Box" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit "I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the "Pebbles Box" – in place of the much rarer "Wine Wine Wine" by Bobby Fuller that appears on "Pebbles, Volume 2". Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003. At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format. This box set, and the companion release "Rancho Texicano", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from "ZZ Top's First Album", "Rio Grande Mud", and "Tejas", aside from 1977's "The Best of ZZ Top" which features two tracks from "Rio Grande Mud" and one track from "First Album". " Tres Hombres" and "Fandango! " were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. Back to Mono (1958–1969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2. The first track, "To Know Him Is to Love Him," released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears. Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, "The First Tycoon of Teen." The package also contained a small, round, red "Back to Mono" pin. Live in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali. The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; "Concert In Japan" (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), "Coltrane In Japan" (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and "Second Night In Tokyo" (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono). (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles "Coltrane In Tokyo Vol. 1" and "Coltrane In Tokyo Vol. 2") The first CD issues were by Impulse! Japan as two 2-CD sets: "Live In Japan Vol. 1" (same as "Coltrane In Japan") and "Live In Japan Vol. 2" (same as "Second Night In Tokyo"). The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes. The side six interview from "Second Night In Tokyo" has never been reissued on any CD edition. Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006. According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is ""the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled", comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career. The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced "Jole Blon," released in 1958, while the last is "I Do Believe," a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, "The Road Goes on Forever". The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels. The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as "Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys" with Willie Nelson and "Highwayman" with The Highwaymen. A notable addition is the previously unreleased "The Greatest Cowboy of Them All," a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for "A Believer Sings the Truth" (1979) and "The Mystery of Life" (1991); two others, "It's Sure Been Fun" and "People in Dallas Got Hair," had never been released in the United States. "Nashville Rebel" was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye. Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007. The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick. The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts. Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album "Past Masters". "Mono Masters" was originally a two-CD set included as part of "The Beatles in Mono" box set. The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version). As a result, the track listing for "Mono Masters" differs from "Past Masters" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix ("Old Brown Shoe", "The Ballad of John and Yoko" and "Let It Be"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes. Tracks 9–12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7" mono "Yellow Submarine" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered. Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or "fold-down", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased. "Get Back" (with B-side "Don't Let Me Down") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format. It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo. Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release. Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993. This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set "Led Zeppelin", all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track "Baby Come On Home". A 54-page booklet was also included with the release. Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake. "To Know Him Is to Love Him" is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, "To Know Him Was To Love Him." It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears. Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's "New Musical Express" chart. Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to "To Know You Is to Love You". In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose "Trio" recording topped the U.S. country singles charts. The song is in 12/8 time. The Doors: Vinyl Box Set is the seventh box set for the rock band The Doors. It is a 7 record set of the original 6 Doors albums, remastered in stereo from the original analogue tapes with a mono version of the debut album. Artwork, packaging, and inner sleeves are replicas of the originals from 1967-1971. The box set was originally planned to be released in October 2007, but was delayed due to a problem with the vinyl, as well as other problems in the production of the box set. The delay ran until February 2008. Reasons for the delay included faulty test pressings, inferiority of the L.A. Woman artwork, and bad compounds in the vinyl that was used first, which caused a search for a new source of virgin vinyl.

**Question:** Who beat the Missouri Tigers in what is alternatively known as the Border Showdown?
**Answer:** The 2008 Kansas Jayhawks

**Context:**
The Missouri Tigers football statistical leaders are individual statistical leaders of the Missouri Tigers football program in various categories, including passing, rushing, receiving, total offense, defensive stats, and kicking. Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season and career leaders. The Tigers represent the University of Missouri in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference. The 2000 Missouri Tigers football team represented the University of Missouri during the 2000 NCAA Division I-A football season. Larry Smith was the coach in 2000. After the season, he was fired and replaced by new coach Gary Pinkel (see also Missouri Tigers football under Gary Pinkel). They began the season promisingly with a 50–20 win over Western Illinois. The next week, however, they lost by 53 points at No. 17 Clemson which set the tone for the rest of the season. Although they were able to win twice in conference, they continually had very little success against ranked opponents. The M&I Bank Border Showdown Series is the official name for the Border War rivalry between the University of Kansas Jayhawks and the University of Missouri Tigers. The Missouri Tigers baseball team represents the University of Missouri in NCAA Division I college baseball. The Missouri Tigers had an overall record of 2053-1339-17 entering the 2012 season. The Border War (alternatively, Border Showdown) is the name of the rivalry between athletic teams from the University of Kansas and University of Missouri, the Kansas Jayhawks and the Missouri Tigers respectively. Athletic competition between the two schools began in 1891. From 1907 to 2012 both schools were in the same athletic conference and competed annually in all sports. "Sports Illustrated" described the rivalry as the oldest (Division I) rivalry west of the Mississippi River in 2011, but it has been dormant since Missouri departed the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference on July 1, 2012. Despite overtures from Missouri to continue athletic competition, no further games have been scheduled between the two schools. Elroy Bert Coan III (born July 2, 1940 in Timpson, Texas) is a former American football player. He is most notable because of his extraordinary speed (9.4 in the 100-yard dash) and size (6'4", 215 lbs) and because he was the central figure in a dispute over the 1960 college football game between the University of Kansas Jayhawks and the University of Missouri Tigers, the second-longest-running rivalry in college football (known as the "Border War"). Coan played for Kansas - and helped the Jayhawks win the 1960 game by a score of 23-7 over Missouri, then-ranked #1. But later, the Big Eight declared Coan ineligible, due to a recruiting violation by Bud Adams while Coan was still at Texas Christian University (TCU) and forfeited the game to Missouri—thus erasing Missouri's only loss on the field that year. Missouri counts the 1960 game as a win by forfeit, thus giving it the only undefeated and untied season in school history. The Big Eight also credited the 1960 game to Missouri. However, Kansas (and the NCAA) count the game as a Kansas victory. Ever since, the two universities have disputed the overall win-loss record in the long-running series. Hearnes Center is a 13,611-seat multi-purpose arena in Columbia, Missouri. The arena opened in 1972. It is currently home to the Missouri Tigers' wrestling and volleyball teams as well as the school's gymnastics and indoor track & field teams.

The team has had 31 head coaches since it started playing organized football in 1890 with the nickname "Tigers". Missouri joined the Western Interstate University Football Association in December 1891, later winning the conference championship three years in a row. The conference disbanded after the 1897 season and Missouri remained independent until joining the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1907. After several changes, the conference eventually became the Big Eight Conference. The Tigers became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996 when the Big Eight disbanded. Missouri subsequently left the Big 12 following the 2011 season and joined as the 14th member of the SEC effective for the 2012 season. The Tigers have played 1,180 games during their 119 seasons. In those seasons, seven coaches have led Missouri to postseason bowl games: Don Faurot, Chauncey Simpson, Dan Devine, Al Onofrio, Warren Powers, Larry Smith, and Gary Pinkel. Nine coaches have also won conference championships with the Tigers: Harry Orman Robinson, C. D. Bliss, Bill Roper, Chester Brewer, John F. Miller, Gwinn Henry, Faurot, Simpson and Devine. The Missouri Tigers men's basketball team represents the University of Missouri in the SEC. Prior to the 2012–2013 season, the basketball team represented the school in the Big 12 Conference. They are located in Columbia, Missouri, playing home games at Mizzou Arena (15,061). The team last played in the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament in 2013. The Tigers' next season in 2017–18 will be their first under new head coach Cuonzo Martin, who was hired away from California to replace the fired Kim Anderson. The Missouri men's basketball program was a charter member of the Big 12 Conference, formed from the Big Eight Conference in 1996. Following the 2016–17 season, the Tigers had an all-time record of 1,593–1,133 and a winning percentage of . The 2008 Kansas Jayhawks football team (variously "Kansas", "KU", or the "Jayhawks") represented the University of Kansas in the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season. It was the school's 119th year of intercollegiate football. The team was looking to continue the success of the prior season in which they lost only a single conference game and went on to win the Orange Bowl. In the ninth week, after defeating Kansas State 52–21, the Jayhawks became Bowl eligible for the fourth consecutive year, a school record. Also, for the first time in school history, Kansas made back-to-back appearances in a Bowl game after accepting the invitation to play in the Insight Bowl versus the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The team finished the regular season with a victory over their archrival, the Missouri Tigers (who was then ranked 13th in the BCS Poll), in the Border War. The Jayhawks concluded the season with an 8–5 overall record (4–4 in the Big 12 Conference).

**Question:** What company claims to manufacture one out of every three objects that provide a shelf life typically ranging from one to five years?
**Answer:** Crown Holdings Incorporated

**Context:**
Shelf Life is a 2004 young adult novel by Robert Corbet. The book was first published in Australia on June 1, 2004 through Allen & Unwin and focuses on the workers of an unnamed supermarket. "Shelf Life" was nominated as one of the CBCA's ""Notable Books of 2005"" in the "Older Readers" category. Canning is a method of preserving food in which the food contents are processed and sealed in an airtight container. Canning provides a shelf life typically ranging from one to five years, although under specific circumstances it can be much longer. A freeze-dried canned product, such as canned dried lentils, could last as long as 30 years in an edible state. In 1974, samples of canned food from the wreck of the "Bertrand", a steamboat that sank in the Missouri River in 1865, were tested by the National Food Processors Association. Although appearance, smell and vitamin content had deteriorated, there was no trace of microbial growth and the 109-year-old food was determined to be still safe to eat. Title 11 of the United States Code sets forth the statutes governing the various types of relief for bankruptcy in the United States. Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code provides an individual the opportunity to propose a plan of reorganization to reorganize their financial affairs while under the bankruptcy court's protection. The purpose of chapter 13 is to enable an individual with a regular source of income to propose a chapter 13 plan that provides for their various classes of creditors. Under chapter 13, the Bankruptcy Court has the power to approve a chapter 13 plan without the approval of creditors as long as it meets the statutory requirements under chapter 13. Chapter 13 plans are usually three to five years in length and may not exceed five years. Chapter 13 is in contrast to the purpose of Chapter 7, which does not provide for a plan of reorganization, but provides for the discharge of certain debt and the liquidation of non-exempt property. A Chapter 13 plan may be looked at as a form of debt consolidation, but a Chapter 13 allows a person to achieve much more than simply consolidating his or her unsecured debt such as credit cards and personal loans. A chapter 13 plan may provide for the three general categories of debt: priority claims, secured claims, priority unsecured claims, and general unsecured claims. Chapter 13 plans are often used to cure arrearages on a mortgage, avoid "underwater" junior mortgages or other liens, pay back taxes over time, or partially repay general unsecured debt. In recent years, some bankruptcy courts have allowed Chapter 13 to be used as a platform to expedite a mortgage modification application. The University of Pennsylvania Band (commonly known as the Penn Band, or its vaudeville-esque performance name The Huge, the Enormous, the Well-Endowed, Undefeated, Ivy-League Champion, University of Pennsylvania Oxymoronic Fighting Quaker Marching Band) is among the most active collegiate band programs in the U.S. The organization is a part of the Department of Athletics at the University of Pennsylvania. Like most of the other 50 performing arts groups on the Penn Campus, it has no affiliation with any academic department and is sponsored by the Vice Provost's Office for Undergraduate Life. Typically ranging between 80 and 100 members every year, it is among the largest and most active student-run organizations on campus, performing upwards of 60 times during the academic year. Like most of the Ivy League Bands, the Penn Band is a scramble band. Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is a form of computer simulation in which atoms and molecules are allowed to interact at given rate that could be controlled based on known physics. This simulation method is typically used in the micro-electrical industry to study crystal surface growth, and it can provide accurate models surface morphology in different growth conditions on a time scales typically ranging from micro-seconds to hours. Experimental methods such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and other computer simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation are widely used. Cyanoacrylates are a family of strong fast-acting adhesives with industrial, medical, and household uses. Cyanoacrylate adhesives have a short shelf life if not used, about one year from manufacture if unopened, and one month once opened. They have some minor toxicity. Confidence Group of Companies Limited (also referred to as Confidence Group) is a Bangladeshi company, involved in manufacturing mid-tech manufacturing engineering products. The conglomerate commenced its operation in 1991 with cement manufacture, and is involved with power generation and the manufacture of Spun Pre-stressed Concrete (SPC) poles. Presently , the conglomerate claims to consist of 8 operational business entities. In the year 2011, the company claims that total revenues grossed to over 7.5 Billion Takas (roughly 100 million Dollars). In the Buddha's first discourse he identifies craving ("tanha") as the cause of suffering ("dukkha"). He then identifies three objects of craving: the craving for existence; the craving for non-existence and the craving for sense pleasures ("kama"). " Kama" is identified as one of five hindrances to the attainment of "jhana" according to the Buddha's teaching. Throughout the Sutta Pitaka the Buddha often compares sexual pleasure to arrows or darts. So in the "Kama Sutta" from the "Sutta Nipata" the Buddha explains that craving sexual pleasure is a cause of suffering. Canned fish are fish which have been processed, sealed in an airtight container such as a sealed tin can, and subjected to heat. Canning is a method of preserving food, and provides a typical shelf life ranging from one to five years.

**Question:** Saturn AL-31 is an engine that powers the aircraft produced in what country?
**Answer:** China

**Context:**
The Sukhoi S-54 is a series of three closely related aircraft proposals; the S-54 trainer aircraft, S-55 light fighter designed for export, and the S-56 carrier-capable light fighter. All members of the family resemble the Sukhoi Su-27 in general form, or the Sukhoi Su-33 more closely, but built around a single example of the Saturn AL-31 engine instead of two, and scaled down accordingly to a smaller layout. The design was offered to several potential customers, including South Africa and India, but was turned down. Development is apparently on hold, awaiting a launch customer. The Levasseur PL.8 was a single engine, two-seat long-distance record-breaking biplane aircraft modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4 carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft produced in France in the 1920s. Levasseur built the aircraft in 1927, specifically for pilots Charles Nungesser and François Coli for a transatlantic attempt to win the Orteig Prize. Only two examples of the type were built, with the first PL.8-01 named "L'Oiseau Blanc" (The White Bird), that gained fame as Nungesser and Coli's aircraft. The Loehle SPAD XIII is a family of American single-seat, biplane, conventional landing gear, single engine, ultralight aircraft produced in kit form by Loehle Aircraft for amateur construction. The aircraft meets the requirements of the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles regulations when equipped with a lightweight engine. The Piper PA-32R is a six-seat, high-performance, single engine, all-metal fixed-wing aircraft produced by Piper Aircraft of Vero Beach, Florida. The design began life as the "Piper Lance", a retractable gear version of the Piper Cherokee Six. Later models became known by the designation "Piper Saratoga". The primary difference between the Lance and early Saratoga is the development of a tapered wing on the Saratoga, replacing the "Hershey Bar" wing on the Lance that was a carryover from the Cherokee Six. Later Saratoga models provided updated/improved avionics, engine and interior touches but retained the same airframe design. The Hawker Hunter is a transonic British jet-powered fighter aircraft that was developed by Hawker Aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was designed to take advantage of the newly developed Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine and the swept wing, and was the first jet-powered aircraft produced by Hawker to be procured by the RAF. On 7 September 1953, the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for aircraft, achieving a speed of 727.63 mph . The Chengdu J-10 ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 歼-10; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 殲-10; [[NATO reporting name]] : Firebird) is a lightweight [[multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] [[fighter aircraft]] capable of all-weather operation, configured with a [[delta wing]] and [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] design, with [[fly-by-wire]] flight controls, and produced by the [[People's Republic of China]]'s [[Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group|Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC)]] for the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] (PLAAF). The Gotha G.VII. a.k.a.GL.VII, was a bomber aircraft produced in Germany during the final months of World War I. With the strategic bombing campaign effectively over, it was intended to be a high-speed tactical bomber with a secondary reconnaissance capability. It was a conventional two-bay biplane design with tractor-mounted engines, and a conventional empennage with twin fins and rudders. The bombardier's position in the nose of the aircraft that had featured on earlier Gotha designs was removed, and the nose of the aircraft severely truncated and fitted with a streamlined nose-cone. This allowed the engines to be located further inboard than on previous designs, bringing them closer to the aircraft's centreline and therefore minimising the effects of asymmetric thrust in the event of an engine failure. The engine nacelles also featured careful streamlining. The Saturn AL-31 is a family of military turbofan engines. It was developed by Lyulka, now NPO Saturn, of Soviet Union, originally for the Sukhoi Su-27 air superiority fighter. It produces a thrust of 123 kN (27,600 lb) with afterburning in the AL-31F, 137 kN (30,800 lb) in the AL-31FM (AL-35F) and 145 kN (32,000 lb) in the AL-37FU variants. Currently it powers all Su-27 derivatives and the Chengdu J-10 multirole jet fighter which has been developed by China. The Ayres Thrush, formerly the Snow S-2, Aero Commander Ag Commander, and Rockwell Thrush Commander, is an American agricultural aircraft produced by Ayres Corporation and more recently by Thrush Aircraft. It is one of the most successful and long-lived agricultural application aircraft types in the world, with almost 2,000 sold since the first example flew 61 years ago. Typical of agricultural aircraft, it is a single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. Originally powered by a radial piston engine, most examples produced since the 1980s have been turboprop-powered. The Lavochkin La-9 (NATO reporting name Fritz) was a Soviet fighter aircraft produced shortly after World War II. It was a piston engined aircraft produced at the start of the jet age.

Frederick William Tate (24 July 1867 – 24 February 1943) was an English cricketer who played in one Test in 1902. This was the at Old Trafford which England lost by 3 runs, and with it the series. Tate had the misfortune to drop a crucial swerving lofted pull off the left-handed Australian captain, Joe Darling, the bowler being the leg-spinner Len Braund from the now Brian Statham End: just forward of square leg, in front of the refreshment stall (the bowler's testimony, and photos locate the structure), slightly in from the boundary, rail/tram-line side of the ground. England lost their ninth wicket in their second innings with eight wanted for victory. Tate joined Wilfred Rhodes and edged his first ball for four, but the fourth ball he received from Saunders bowled him. The patch of turf on which Tate dropped the catch is now in the pavilion lawn at Whalley Range Cricket Club, after Old Trafford lifted its playing area in August 2008, as is that where Clem Hill took his famous running catch in front of the pavilion in the same game. The England captain, Archie MacLaren, was born in Whalley Range and grew up there. Joseph Bertram Ford (7 May 1886 – after 1914) was an English footballer. His regular position was as a forward. He was born in Northwich, Cheshire. He played for Witton Albion, Crewe Alexandra, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Goole Town.

**Question:**  What is the title of the memoir written by the honoree of the Black and White Ball?
**Answer:** Personal History

**Context:**
Katharine Meyer Graham (June 16, 1917 – July 17, 2001) was an American publisher. She led her family's newspaper, "The Washington Post", for more than two decades, overseeing its most famous period, the Watergate coverage that eventually led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Her memoir, "Personal History", won the Pulitzer Prize in 1998. Golf (ゴルフ , Gorufu ) is a sports-simulation video game developed and released by Nintendo in 1984 for the NES. The player one character wears a white shirt and shoes with blue pants and uses a white ball, while the player two character wears a red shirt and shoes with black pants and uses a red ball. The Black and White Ball was a masquerade ball held on November 28, 1966 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Hosted by author Truman Capote, the ball was in honor of "The Washington Post" publisher Katharine Graham. Snooker ( , ) is a cue sport which originated among British Army officers in Etawah, India in the latter half of the 19th century. It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth, or baize, with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue and 22 coloured balls, players must strike the white ball (or "cue ball") to pot the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game, or frame, is won by the player who scores the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames. Acaciella angustissima (Prairie acacia, White ball acacia, Ocpatl, Palo de Pulque) is most recognized for its drought tolerance and its ability to be used as a green manure and ground covering. It is a perennial, deciduous, and belongs to the Fabaceae family (bean/legume) and as it grows it starts as a shrub but eventually matures to a small tree. The tree has a high density of leaves along with small clumps of white flowers and creates 4–7 cm long seed pods. The function of the sight screen, which is usually completely black or white in color, is to offer the batsman a clean view of the bowler and his or her delivery, such that distractions including spectators do not disturb the batsman. In limited overs matches such as One Day Internationals or Twenty20 Internationals, which are usually played with a white ball, the sight screen is usually black, or otherwise dark. In Test matches, in which a cherry-red ball is used for play, the sight screen is usually white. The 1956 NFL season was the 37th regular season of the National Football League. CBS became the first network to televise some regular season games across the nation. Meanwhile, the league started to use a natural leather ball with white end stripes, instead of the white ball with black stripes, for night games. The common iora ("Aegithina tiphia") is a small passerine bird found across the tropical Indian subcontinent with populations showing plumage variations, some of which are designated as subspecies. A species found in scrub and forest, it is easily detected from its loud whistles and the bright colours. During the breeding season, males display by fluffing up their feathers and spiral in the air appearing like a green, black, yellow and white ball. Blackballing is a rejection in a traditional form of secret ballot, where a white ball or ballot constitutes a vote in support and a black ball signifies opposition. This system is typically used where a club's rules provide that one or two objections, rather than an at-least-50% share of votes, are sufficient to defeat a proposition. Since the seventeenth century, these rules have commonly applied to elections to membership of many gentlemen's clubs and similar institutions such as Freemasonry and fraternities. Buddleja 'White Ball' is a hybrid cultivar developed by Horticultural Research International, at Boskoop in the Netherlands. One of the parents was the white form of "B. davidii" var. "nanhoensis", 'Alba'.

**Answer:** about 115 miles (185 km)

**Context:**
Castle Air Force Base (1941–1995) is a former United States Air Force Strategic Air Command base located northeast of Atwater, northwest of Merced and about 115 miles (185 km) south of Sacramento, California. The Pacific Flying Club is a flight school based out of Boundary Bay Airport in Delta, British Columbia. It is the largest flight school on the west coast of Canada. The Pacific Flying Club was formed on July 14, 1965. In 2015 Pacific Flying Club will be celebrating its 50th anniversary by hosting the Webster Memorial Trophy Competition. The North American Institute of Aviation (NAIA) was a private, FAA Part-141 flight school located in Conway, South Carolina, in the United States. Founded on July 7, 1972 in Hammonton, New Jersey, then later moved to South Carolina in 1978, NAIA specialized in flight and aircraft maintenance training. It has also had a campus in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The school had close connections to North European Aviation Resources (NEAR) of Vigra, Norway, and was for a period of time the ab-initio school of Scandinavian Airlines. The school subsequently commanded an excellent reputation in Northern Europe. NAIA boasted an international student population and graduates work for airlines world wide. The school concentrated its efforts on FAA Part-141 operations and their European JAR-FCL approved program in cooperation with NEAR, which maintained a representative at the school. NAIA operated out of the Conway-Horry County Airport where it was also the fixed-base operator (FBO). Aerocondor (ATA Aerocondor Transportes Aéreos Lda) was an airline and flight school based in Cascais, Portugal. It was a regional airline operating scheduled services in mainland Portugal and to Madeira, as well as scheduled passenger services in France and charter services to the United Kingdom and Spain. Its main bases were Portela Airport, Lisbon and Madeira Airport with its own flight school in Cascais Aerodrome. American Airlines Flight 157 was a civil aviation accident resulting in 28 fatalities. The aircraft, a Douglas DC-6, was flying on November 29, 1949, from New York City bound for Mexico City with 46 passengers and crew. After one engine failed in mid-flight, a series of critical mistakes by the flight crew caused the pilot to lose control of the plane during the final approach to a routine stopover at Love Field in Dallas, Texas. The airliner slid off the runway and struck a parked airplane, a hangar, and a flight school before crashing into a business across from the airport. 26 passengers and two flight attendants died. The pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, and 15 passengers survived. American Flyers is an American flight school.

**Question:** What was the population in 2010 of the town where The Stelljes House is located ?
**Answer:** 810

**Context:**
The Stelljes House is a historic house on New Hampshire Route 31 in Goshen, New Hampshire. This 1-1/2 story Cape style house was built c. 1800, and is one of the oldest of a cluster of plank-frame houses in Goshen. The framing is three-inch planking attached to sills, which rests on a rubble and granite stone foundation. The main facade was probably five bays wide originally; the right side bays have been replaced by a 20th-century picture window. A chimney rises off-center through the front slope of the roof. An ell extends from the southern portion of the rear of the main block. Kadıköy is a belde (town) in the central district of Yalova Province, Turkey. At it is 7 km south west of Yalova and at the midpoint of Armutlu Peninsula. The population of Kadıköy is 5414 as of 2010. The settlement was founded by an Ottoman kadı ("judge") . Hence it was named as "Kadıköy" ("Judge's village"). During Ottoman Empire most of the population was composed of Greeks. But according to Population exchange between Greece and Turkey agreement the Greek population was replaced by Turkish population from Greece. Refuges from Caucasus after the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) were also settled in the village. The village was declared a seat of township in 1991. Intensive farming such as green house farming and floriculture is the main economic activity of the town. Carpenter is a ghost town in Mesa County, Colorado, United States, twelve miles northeast of Grand Junction at the end of an extension to 27¼ Road. The settlement was established by William Thomas Carpenter early in 1890 to provide the miners who worked in his two Book Cliff mines with a place to live. He began building shacks to house his single miners and later erected small houses for the employees with families. As a result of the town's rapid growth, a request to the U.S. post office to establish a branch there in June 1890 was quickly obliged and the community was officially dubbed Carpenter. However, the town never attained a population of over 50, and the post office closed its doors after only a year. After the closure of its post office, Carpenter built a company store and a combination boarding house/restaurant. Book Cliff company stone cutters and masons constructed several buildings and many foundations at Carpenter, using stone from the company quarry near the cliffs. One of the finest examples of a building made of Book Cliff sandstone is the Fruita, Colorado Catholic church. Several years of prosperity followed the arrival of the Little Book Cliff Railway at the townsite in 1892. Carpenter began to formulate big plans for his village. He envisioned it as a tourist resort complete with hotel, dance pavilion, picnic areas, and even a lake that was to be fed by a spring located near his Book Cliff mines. Carpenter renamed the camp "Poland Spring" after a noted resort of that name in Maine. It was variously referred to as Polen, Pollen, and Polan Springs, despite the fact that Carpenter’s intended name was evidenced by his having it emblazoned on the side of one of his railroad excursion cars. The resort plans were never completed because Carpenter went broke shortly after the Panic of 1893. Isaac Chauncey Wyman, a wealthy Massachusetts investor, became the next owner of the Book Cliff company. The town continued to enjoy an active existence because he did much to improve the mines and thus created a need for additional employees. The old eating house, referred to as the "Hotel de Carpenter" on occasion, was converted into a school and church for the camp’s inhabitants, and many company structures were rebuilt and improved during Wyman’s tenure as owner. The new name "Book Cliff" was applied to the town but did not adhere any better than did Poland Springs. Usually people referred to the place as the “Book Cliff Mines.” The town reached its zenith and then began a gradual decline following Wyman’s death in 1910. In his will Wyman left the town, railroad, and mines to Princeton University. Princeton managed everything for 15 years then decided to abandon it all in 1925. By the end of that summer nearly everything had been sold, dismantled, and hauled away. Ancón is a corregimiento in Panamá District, Panamá Province, Panama with a population of 29,761 as of 2010. Its population as of 1990 was 11,518; its population as of 2000 was 11,169. It is sometimes considered a suburb or small town within Panama City, northeast of the limits of the town of Balboa. Ancon Hill is also the name of a large hill that overlooks Panama City and once served as a form of protection from pirates and sea invasion. The township was originally located around this hill, and was created to house employees of the Panama Canal during its construction. As part of the construction effort, the historic Gorgas Army Hospital was founded and built on the hillside. The first ship to officially transit the canal, SS "Ancon" , was named after the district. The community continued to serve as housing for employees of the Panama Canal Company until 1980, when parts of it began to be turned over to the Panamanian government under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Modern-day Ancón is a "corregimiento" (the Panamanian equivalent of a suburb in the United States) of Panama City, serving mainly as a residential area. The Gorgas Army Hospital building is now the Panamanian Oncology Hospital, primarily used for cancer research. The area also houses Panama's Supreme Court, just a few feet away from the Gorgas Army Hospital building, and several Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute buildings for research into tropical biology. Ancón is also a parish ("parroquia") of the District of Panama, located in the Panama Canal adjacent area. Clarkstown is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States. The town is on the eastern border of the county, located north of the town of Orangetown, east of the town of Ramapo, south of the town of Haverstraw, and west of the Hudson River. As of the 2010 census, the town had a total population of 84,187. The community of New City, the county seat of Rockland County, is also the seat of town government and of the Clarkstown Police Department, the county sheriff's police office, and the county correctional facility. New City makes up about 41.47% of the town's population. Carrizozo is a town in Lincoln County, New Mexico and is the county seat with a population of 996 at the 2010 census. Founded in 1899, the town provided the main railroad access for Lincoln County, and the town experienced significant population growth in the early decades of the 1900s. However, with declining relevance of the railroad, the population of the town has gradually declined. The town is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 380. The Town of Timnath is a Statutory Town located in Larimer County, Colorado, United States. Founded in 1882, Timnath is a small agricultural/farming community located southeast of Fort Collins, Colorado, approximately one-half mile east of the Harmony Road/Interstate 25 interchange, on a small bluff east of the Cache la Poudre River. The surrounding farmlands have been used primarily for potatoes, alfalfa, sugar beets, and cattle. Although the town has remained virtually unchanged in recent decades, the encroaching growth of both Fort Collins to the west and Windsor to the south have placed the town in an area considered favorable to development. The population was 625 at the 2010 census. Timnath has been one of the fastest-growing communities in Colorado since 2010, and in 2016 had an estimated population nearing 3,000. Haverstraw is a town in Rockland County, New York, United States, located north of the Town of Clarkstown and the Town of Ramapo; east of Orange County, New York; south of the Town of Stony Point; and west of the Hudson River. The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern part. The population was 36,634 at the 2010 census. The name comes from the Dutch word "Haverstroo" meaning "oats straw", referring to the grasslands along the river. The town contains three villages, one of which is also known as Haverstraw. Haverstraw village is the original seat of government for the town, hosting the area's historic central downtown business district and the densest population in northern Rockland County. Cropper is an unincorporated community within Shelby County, Kentucky, United States. It was also known as Croppers Depot. Their post office is closed. The town of Cropper (Population Cal. at 205 in 2010) is located in northeast Shelby County, Kentucky. The origin of its name comes from the town's founder James Cropper, a blacksmith and store keeper who was the first person to build a house there sometime in the 1790s. He also was the town's first postmaster. The majority of Cropper's original citizens were members of the Low Dutch colony who were in the area as early as 1786. In 1807, a new group of settlers from Virginia increased the town's population. In 1855, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L and N) along with a depot opened on the east end of town. A hotel soon opened afterwards. This railroad line was closed in the early 1970s. Another occurrence, in 1855, was the founding of Union Grove Church. This church had three different denominations that included Christian, Methodist and Baptist. The only cemetery in Cropper is on the church grounds. In June 1900, the Baptist separated from the Union Church, and by 1903 it had its own building. In 1967, the Union Grove Church was renamed Cropper Christian Church. In 1905, a bank was opened by Ben Allen Thomas, but it was closed in 1921. An 1882 map shows the first school in Cropper which was a large two-story building with grades one through twelve. It burned in 1951 and was replaced with a one-story elementary school. The team mascot was the Yellow Jackets. Goshen is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 810 at the 2010 census.

**Question:** What American pianist and composer was a guest muscian on the Manhattan Blues Project album by Steve Hunter?
**Answer:** Philip Aaberg

**Context:**
Eric Woolfson sings The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was is an album by the progressive rock musician Eric Woolfson, co-creator with Alan Parsons of The Alan Parsons Project, as well as main songwriter and manager of the band. Released in 2009, this was Woolfson's final album before he died of cancer in December of that year. The album includes songs that remained unreleased since the Project time for various reasons; however, as Woolfson himself remarks in the booklet, Parsons' dislike for some of Woolfson's compositions would have often caused them to be excluded from a Project album in its very early stages - such as, for example, "Steal Your Heart Away", an "unashamedly commercial" song with a conventionally sentimental lyric, which Parsons, in Woolfson's words, would have absolutely detested. "Somewhere in the Audience" and "Immortal" are slightly re-arranged and re-recorded versions of two of Woolfson's demos for his 2003 musical about Edgar Allan Poe; the final versions of these songs, sung by the musical's protagonist Steve Balsamo, are featured on the album "". "Train to Wuxi" was the original version of "Train to Freedom", which is also included (with different lyrics) in the Poe musical and features Woolfson's one and only guitar solo. Detroit (a.k.a. The Band Detroit, so as not to be confused with the city of Detroit) was a spinoff of rock group The Detroit Wheels. This revised version of that band was formed by Mitch Ryder as a successor to The Wheels in 1970. The only original Wheel in the group was the drummer Johnny "Bee" Badanjek; other members were guitarists Steve Hunter and Brett Tuggle, organist Harry Phillips and bassist W.R. Cooke. A single album was released by this grouping, a 1971 self-titled LP issued on Paramount Records (US #176 in 1972). They had a hit with their version of the Lou Reed - penned song "Rock & Roll", which Reed liked enough to ask Steve Hunter to join his backing band. Ryder quit the group because of voice problems in 1972, and Detroit vocalist Rusty Day (formerly of the American Amboy Dukes and Cactus) took over his spot; without Ryder, the group floundered, and eventually broke up in 1974.

**Context:**
The Tennessee River is the largest tributary of the Ohio River. It is approximately 652 mi long and is located in the southeastern United States in the Tennessee Valley. The river was once popularly known as the Cherokee River, among other names, as many of the Cherokee had their territory along its banks, especially in eastern Tennessee and northern Alabama. Its current name is derived from the Cherokee village "Tanasi". The Beasley Mounds Site (40SM43) (also known as the Dixon Springs Mound Site) is a Mississippian culture archaeological site located at the confluence of Dixon Creek and the Cumberland River near the unincorporated community of Dixon Springs in Smith County, Tennessee. The site was first excavated by amateur archaeologists in the 1890s. More examples of Mississippian stone statuary have been found at the site than any other in the Middle Tennessee area. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Obion Mounds (40 HY 14), also known as the "Work Farm Site", is an archaeological site of the Mississippian culture located north of Paris, Henry County, Tennessee, on the north fork of the Obion River. The site is the largest Mississippian site in western Tennessee and was probably inhabited by 1000 to 1100 CE. and abandoned by 1300. It consists of seven platform mounds surrounding a plaza measuring 200 ft by 900 ft . The largest mound at the site was 500 ft wide by 30 ft tall with a ramp leading to its summit. At one point the mounds and plaza were surrounded with a wooden palisade. The site also has 2 depressions thought to be borrow pits from which the soil to construct the mounds was taken. In 1845 the owner of the site, Solomon Hartsfield, was digging in one of the borrow pits when he discovered a stone statue. The statue was later damaged in a house fire during the late 19th century and only its head now remains. It is the only Mississippian site in western Tennessee to have produced such a statue. Moundville Archaeological Site, also known as the Moundville Archaeological Park, is a Mississippian culture site on the Black Warrior River in Hale County, near the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Extensive archaeological investigation has shown that the site was the political and ceremonial center of a regionally organized Mississippian culture chiefdom polity between the 11th and 16th centuries. The archaeological park portion of the site is administered by the University of Alabama Museums and encompasses 185 acre , consisting of 29 platform mounds around a rectangular plaza.

The 7.25-hectare site is built over the remains of a Late Woodland village. It has a central group of platform mounds around a central plaza and another smaller plaza area to the southwest of the largest mound. The site was occupied from 1100 to 1500 CE during the Medley (1100 to 1300) and Jackson (1300 to 1500) phases of the local chronology. Some very deep midden areas have been excavated from the village surrounding the mounds and plazas, some as deep as 1 m to 1.5 m thick, attesting to the long term habitation of this site. The Marshall Site (15CE27) is an Early Mississippian culture archaeological site located near Bardwell in Carlisle County, Kentucky, on a bluff spur overlooking the Mississippi River floodplain. The site was occupied from about 900 to about 1300 CE during the James Bayou Phase of the local chronology and was abandoned sometime during the succeeding Dorena Phase. Its inhabitants may have moved to the Turk Site, which is located on the nearest adjacent bluff spur to the south, and which was founded about this time. It is several miles south of the Wickliffe Mounds Site. Marshall is a large village site, with evidence of once having had mounds and earthworks, although it is unclear from what time period these mounds would date. It is one of the few James Bayou Phase sites to be extensively excavated. Because it was abandoned. its archaeological features were undisturbed by later occupations.

The Kincaid Mounds Historic Site (11MX2-11; 11PO2-10)   1050-1400 CE, is the site of a city from the prehistoric Mississippian culture. One of the largest settlements of the Mississippian culture, it was located at the southern tip of present-day U.S. state of Illinois. Kincaid Mounds has been notable for both its significant role in native North American prehistory and for the central role the site has played in the development of modern archaeological techniques. The site had at least 11 substructure platform mounds (ranking fifth for mound-culture pyramids). Artifacts from the settlement link its major habitation and the construction of the mounds to the Mississippian period, but it was also occupied earlier during the Woodland period. Wickliffe Mounds (15 BA 4) is a prehistoric, Mississippian culture archaeological site located in Ballard County, Kentucky, just outside the town of Wickliffe, about 3 mi from the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Archaeological investigations have linked the site with others along the Ohio River in Illinois and Kentucky as part of the Angel Phase of Mississippian culture. Wickliffe Mounds is controlled by the State Parks Service, which operates a museum at the site for interpretation of the ancient community. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is also a Kentucky Archeological Landmark and State Historic Site. The Little Egypt site (9 MU 102) was an archaeological site located in Murray County, Georgia, near the junction of the Coosawattee River and Talking Rock Creek. The site originally had three platform mounds surrounding a plaza and a large village area. It was destroyed during the construction of the Dam of Carters Lake in 1972. It was situated between the Ridge and Valley and Piedmont sections of the state in a flood plain. Using Mississippian culture pottery found at the site archaeologists dated the site to the Middle and Late South Appalachinian Mississippian culture (a regional variation of the Mississippian culture) habitation from 1300 to 1600 CE during the Dallas, Lamar, and Mouse Creek phases.

Bush administration and subsequently made public. In collaboration with a ghostwriter, Plame wrote a memoir detailing her career and the events leading up to her resignation from the CIA, and subsequently wrote and published two spy novels. After a number of years out of the limelight, she later made the news for leading a campaign to raise enough money to buy a controlling interest of Twitter stock, in order to remove Donald Trump from the platform, as well as controversy surrounding antisemitic activity on social media, for which she subsequently apologized. All the President's Men is a 1974 non-fiction book by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two of the journalists investigating the first Watergate break-in and ensuing scandal for "The Washington Post". The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, and the revelation of the Nixon tapes by Alexander Butterfield in 1973. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the "Post", naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of "The Philadelphia Inquirer" and former managing editor of "The New York Times", has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein "maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time." The Time of Our Time is an anthology of Norman Mailer’s various literary works, published by Modern Library in 1998. The work was designed to commemorate both the fiftieth anniversary of "The Naked and the Dead" (1948), and Mailer’s seventy-fifth birthday. Norman Mailer edited the anthology himself, choosing to organize the content not by the chronology in which the pieces are written, but the chronology of the events that the works describe; some of the excerpts are written in the midst of the action, while others may come upon forty years of reflection. Selected texts that deal with the ancient world, however, appear out of sequence at the end of the volume. (Mailer’s explanation: “Nobody is perfect.”) Excerpts from Mailer’s most notable works, including "The Naked and the Dead", "Advertisements for Myself" (1959), "Superman Comes to the Supermarket" (1960), "The Armies of the Night" (1968), "Miami and the Siege of Chicago" (1968), "Of a Fire on the Moon" (1970), and "The Executioner's Song" (1979), as well as several works in their entirety, including "The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster" (1957), "The Time of Her Time" (1959), and various transcribed and annotated interviews with the likes of William F. Buckley, Gore Vidal, Kate Millett, and John Ehrlichman. Washington: Behind Closed Doors is a 1977 American 6-part television miniseries produced by Paramount Television and broadcast by ABC in 1977. It is based on John Ehrlichman's book "The Company", a novel inspired by the author's time with the Nixon administration. Blind Ambition is a four-part American miniseries that aired on CBS from May 20, 1979 to May 23, 1979 focusing on the Watergate coverup and based on the memoirs of former White House counsel John Dean and his wife Maureen. John Wesley Dean III (born October 14, 1938) is an investment banker, author, columnist, lecturer and former attorney who served as White House Counsel for United States President Richard Nixon from July 1970 until April 1973. In this position, he became deeply involved in events leading up to the Watergate burglaries and the subsequent Watergate scandal cover-up. He was referred to as the "master manipulator of the cover-up" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He pleaded guilty to a single felony count, in exchange for becoming a key witness for the prosecution. This ultimately resulted in a reduced prison sentence, which he served at Fort Holabird outside Baltimore, Maryland. The Company is a political fiction "roman à clef" novel written by John Ehrlichman, a former close aide to President Richard Nixon and a figure in the Watergate scandal, first published in 1976 by Simon & Schuster. The title is an insider nickname for the Central Intelligence Agency. The plot is loosely based on events leading up to the Watergate coverup, centered on Nixon administration attempts to cover up its own illegal activity and that of the CIA dating back to the Kennedy administration. Although all characters are fictional, most are based on real-life political figures, and journalists such as columnist Jack Anderson. Roman à clef (] , ), French for "novel with a key", is a novel about real life, overlaid with a façade of fiction. The fictitious names in the novel represent real people, and the "key" is the relationship between the nonfiction and the fiction. The "key" may be produced separately by the author or implied through the use of epigraphs or other literary techniques. Operation Sandwedge was a proposed clandestine intelligence-gathering operation against the political enemies of the Richard Nixon presidential administration. The proposals were put together by H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Jack Caulfield in 1971. Caulfield, a former police officer, created a plan to target the Democratic Party and the anti-Vietnam War movement, inspired by what he believed to be the Democratic Party's employment of a private investigation firm.

**Question:** Are Mike Bryan and Ray Ruffels both tennis players?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
The 2007 Tennis Channel Open was a tennis event on the 2007 ATP Tour. Lleyton Hewitt, who was the 2006 runner-up, was the singles champion, while Bob and Mike Bryan were the doubles champions. The event was held in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Darling Tennis Center. It was the twentieth Tennis Channel Open, but just the second to be held in Las Vegas. The ITF women's competition was won by Caroline Wozniacki in singles and by Victoria Azarenka and Tatiana Poutchek for doubles. The Virginia Slims Circuit was a tennis tour consisting of a group of originally nine female professional players. Formed in 1970, the Virginia Slims Circuit eventually became the basis for the later named WTA Tour. The players, dubbed the "Original 9", rebelled against the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) due to the wide inequality between the amount of prize money paid to male tennis players and to female tennis players. The 1912 World Hard Court Championships (WHCC) (French: "Championnats du Monde de Tennis sur Terre Battue") was the inaugural edition of the World Hard Court Championships tennis tournament, considered as the precursor to the French Open, and was held on the clay courts of the Stade Français at the Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris from 1 June through 9 June 1912. This tournament was open to all international amateur tennis players and was part of a series of world championships being advanced by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), the others being the World Grass Court Championships (Wimbledon) and the World Covered Court Championships held in a variety of countries. The WHCC was open to all nationalities unlike the French Championships which were open only to tennis players who were licensed in France. Michael Carl Bryan (born April 29, 1978) is an American professional tennis player. The right-hander turned professional in 1998. With his twin brother Bob, he has been world No. 1 doubles player for much of the last several years, first achieving top ranking in September 2003, and they became the second men's doubles team to complete the career golden slam by winning the 2012 Summer Olympics. He currently holds the records for the most ATP men's doubles titles (115) and final appearances (171), and is tied for fourth all-time in men's titles in the Open Era, all with his brother with the exception of one with Mahesh Bhupathi and another with Mark Knowles. William Bowrey was the defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals to Ray Ruffels. Ray Ruffels and Allan Stone were the defending champions. Raymond Owen "Ray" Ruffels (born 23 March 1946 in Sydney) is an Australian former professional tennis player and coach. The 1972 New Zealand Open, also known as Benson and Hedges Open for sponsorship reasons, was a combined men's and women's professional tennis tournament held at the Stanley Street Courts in Auckland, New Zealand. It was an independent event, i.e. not part of the 1972 Grand Prix or 1972 World Championship Tennis circuit. The tournament was played on outdoor grass courts and was held from 7 December through 12 December 1971. Ray Ruffels and Kerry Melville won the singles titles. Athletic DNA (ADNA) is an American sports apparel company. Founded in Seattle in 2007, ADNA began by training young tennis athletes, which evolved into sponsoring Select Junior Tennis players, and then expanded to manufacturing clothing for youth and adult tennis players. ADNA has since spread to professional tennis, and currently sponsors players on the ATP Tour & WTA Tour. The history of tennis in New Zealand dates back to the 1870s, the decade when the development of modern tennis began. The first "New Zealand Tennis Championships" were played at Farndon in Hawkes Bay in 1886. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association (NZLTA) was formed at a meeting held in Hastings in December 1886. Shortly after its inauguration, the New Zealand Association became affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association (England). In 1904 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association amalgamated with six Australian state tennis associations to form the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association played a significant role in the origin of the Australian Open. Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia created the tournament called "The Australasian Mens Championships" (which later became Australian Open) in 1905 and was first played in Warehouseman's Cricket Ground and it was decided that championships would be hosted by both Australian as well as New Zealand venues. New Zealand hosted the championship twice— Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912). The geographical remoteness of both the countries (Australia and New Zealand) made it difficult for foreign players to enter the tournament. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding). Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France on 1 March 1913. From 1905 until 1919, New Zealand and Australian tennis players participated in the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) under the alias of "Team Australasia", the team claimed a title six times (1907, 1908, 1909, 1911, 1914, 1919), however, there were attempts to severance this trans-tasmanian partnership, in order to allow New Zealand players to represent their nation on international tennis events. In 1922, New Zealand dropped out from this partnership and on 16 March 1923 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association was granted affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Association and thereby became eligible to enter the International Lawn Tennis Challenge in its own right. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association filed its first challenge with United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Tennis New Zealand was the founding member of Oceania Tennis Federation in 1993.

From Birth to Burial is the seventh studio album by American rock band 10 Years. The album was released on April 21, 2015, through their own independent label called Palehorse Records, which is a part of Warner Music Group's Independent Label Group. (How to Live) As Ghosts is the eighth studio album by American rock band 10 Years. While their prior album, "From Birth to Burial" alluded to the band's plan at the time for it to be their final album, "(How to Live) As Ghosts" alludes to the sentiment of it being a rebirth of a band, while also alluding to the general sentiment that humanity spends too much time worrying about death rather than life. The album's first single, "Novacaine" was released in August 2017. 10 Years is an American alternative metal band, formed in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1999. The band consists of Jesse Hasek (lead vocals), Brian Vodinh (drums, guitar, backing vocals), Chad Huff (bass guitar) and Matt Wantland (guitar).

Their eighth studio album, "(How to Live) As Ghosts", is scheduled for release on October 27, 2017. United Pursuit (also known as, United Pursuit Band) is an American Christian music worship band from Knoxville, Tennessee, where they started making music in 2008, but were founded in 2006. They have released two live albums, "Live at the Banks House" (2010), and "Simple Gospel" (2015). The 2015 album was their breakthrough release upon the "Billboard" magazine charts. Aside from live recordings, United Pursuit has produced several studio records, the first of which was "Radiance" in 2008, which was a compilation of music written by several of the United Pursuit artists. Other studio records put out by United Pursuit featured a particular United Pursuit artist. Two of these records, "In the Night Season" (2009) and "Endless Years" (2012) featured Will Reagan and were released under the brands "Will Reagan and United Pursuit Band" and "Will Reagan and United Pursuit". "The Wild Inside" (2014) featured Michael Ketterer and was released under the brand "Michael Ketterer and United Pursuit". United Pursuit is also known for their weekly Tuesday gatherings from which many of their songs were written. These gatherings were birthed in a residence on Banks Ave in a North Knoxville neighborhood. This residence is commonly referred to now as the Banks House. Over the course of several years, these gatherings have grown in number, pushing United Pursuit and others out of the Banks House and into, at one point, a larger living room and eventually other commercial and public spaces. After much transition, United Pursuit's Tuesday gatherings found a home at a renovated commercial space near downtown Knoxville. This space, now commonly referred to as the Fifth Avenue House, continues to grow as a commercial space and currently caters to both United Pursuit and independent events such as wedding, concerts, etc.. . The music released and the Tuesday gatherings held by United Pursuit over the years has been the product of their humble beginning with a simple desire to commune with God and each other. The name United Pursuit is in itself reflective of the heart of the United Pursuit community, "doing life together as we seek God through both song and relationship with others". Live with the Possum is a live album by American country music singer George Jones released on November 9, 1999 on the Asylum Records label.

WWE Extreme Rules (simply known as Extreme Rules) is a professional wrestling event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticut-based promotion, and broadcast live and available only through pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network. The name of the event stems from most matches being contested under hardcore wrestling regulations; the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion originally used the term to describe the regulations for all of its matches. The event name was established in 2009; however, its theme began with its predecessor, One Night Stand, which was promoted in 2005 and 2006 as an ECW reunion show. In 2007, WWE promoted the show as one of its own regular PPV events but kept the ECW concept of Extreme Rules matches. In 2009, WWE renamed the One Night Stand event to WWE Extreme Rules. The 2009 Extreme Rules event was noted by WWE to be a direct continuation of the One Night Stand chronology. However, the 2010 event was later promoted as only the second event under a new chronology, one that is no longer a direct continuation of the One Night Stand events. Starting in 2010, Extreme Rules was moved from June to late April/early May to replace Backlash as the post-WrestleMania pay-per-view event. For 2013, the event was scheduled to take place in mid-May and replace Over the Limit, which was moved to October before being discontinued later that year and replaced by Battleground.

**Question:** Are Centaurium and Dacrydium both genuses of plant species?
**Answer:** yes

**Context:**
A halophyte is a plant that grows in waters of high salinity, coming into contact with saline water through its roots or by salt spray, such as in saline semi-deserts, mangrove swamps, marshes and sloughs and seashores. The word derives from Ancient Greek ἅλας (halas) 'salt' and φυτόν (phyton) 'plant'. An example of a halophyte is the salt marsh grass "Spartina alterniflora" (smooth cordgrass). Relatively few plant species are halophytes—perhaps only 2% of all plant species. Lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV) is a plant virus belonging to the virus order "Mononegavirales", family "Rhabdoviridae" and genus "Cytorhabdovirus". It was first identified in Australia in the plant species "Lactuca sativa" in 1963 by Stubbs et al. Since then it has been identified in many other plant species including "Datura stramonium" and "Nicotiana glutinosa". The virus is transmitted by the insect vector "Hyperomyzus lactucae" the insect can become infected by feeding on an infected plant. It then acts as a reservoir for the virus in which it can multiply. The virus is also transmitted congenitally to its progeny Dacrydium is a genus of conifers belonging to the podocarp family Podocarpaceae. Sixteen species of evergreen dioecious trees and shrubs are presently recognized. The genus was first described by Solander in 1786, and formerly included many more species, which were divided into sections A, B, and C by Florin in 1931. The revisions of de Laubenfels and Quinn (see references), reclassified the former section A as the new genus "Falcatifolium", divided Section C into new genera "Lepidothamnus, Lagarostrobos" and "Halocarpus", and retained Section B as genus "Dacrydium".

They occur within 1,543 genera from 211 families; there are also 1,276 naturalised alien or invasive plant species more commonly known as weeds. There are an estimated 150,000 cryptogam species or nonvascular plants which include lichens, and fungi although only 1,786 species have been published, with 948 algae and 672 lichen the majority. The flora of Lebanon" includes approximately 2,600 plant species. Situated on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Basin", Lebanon is a reservoir of plant diversity and one of the world's Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities. Endemic species constitute 12% of the Lebanese flora, 221 plant species are broad endemics and 90 are narrow endemics. Centaurium (Centaury) is a genus of 20 species in the gentian family (Gentianaceae), tribe Chironieae, subtribe Chironiinae. The genus was named after the centaur Chiron, famed in Greek mythology for his skill in medicinal herbs. It is distributed across Europe and into Asia. The flora of India is one of the richest in the world due to the wide range of climate, topology and habitat in the country. There are estimated to be over 16,000 species of flowering plants in India, which constitute some 6-7 percent of the total plant species in the world. India is home to more than 45,000 species of plants, including a variety of endemics. The use of plants as a source of medicines has been an integral part of life in India from the earliest times. There are more than 3000 Indian plant species officially documented as possessing great medicinal potential. India is divided into eight main floristic regions : Western Himalayas, Eastern Himalayas, Assam, Indus plain, Ganges plain, the Deccan, Malabar and the Andaman Islands. Centaurium pulchellum is a species of flowering plant in the gentian family known by the common name lesser centaury. It differs from "Centaurium erythraea" by lacking basal rosette of leaves and by having a developed peduncle below the flowers. It is often much smaller, less than ten centimetres. Burkina Faso is largely wild bush country with a mixture of grass and small trees in varying proportions. The savanna region is mainly grassland in the rainy season and semi desert during the harmattan period (defined as the period when stormy and dusty Sahara winds blow dry and hot). Fauna, one of the most diverse in West Africa, includes the elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo, monkey, lions, crocodile, giraffe, various types of antelope, and a vast variety of bird and insect life. The country has 147 mammal species, 330 aquatic species including 121 species of fish and 2067 different plant species. Of the plant species, the dominant endemic species are shea tree "(Butyrospermum parkii") and the baobab, the former plant species has immense economic value to the country. The abundances of plant species are often measured by plant cover, i.e. the relative area covered by different plant species in a small plot. Plant cover is not biased by the size and distributions of individuals, and is an important and often measured characteristic of the composition of plant communities. Plant cover data may be used to classify the studied plant community into a vegetation type, to test different ecological hypothesis on plant abundance, and in gradient studies, where the effects of different environmental gradients on the abundance of specific plant species are investigated.

**Question:** What is the name of the town linked by rail to Kendal, named after a lake of the same name?
**Answer:** Windermere, Cumbria

**Context:**
The surname Kendall or Kendal (also spelt Kendell, Kendoll, Kendel, Kendle, Kindell, Kindel, or Kindle) has two widely accepted origins. The first is from the market town of Kendal in Cumbria. The earliest recorded form of this town's name is in 1095 as "Kircabikendala", literally "Church by Kent dale". The second is as an anglicization of Middle Welsh "Kyndelw" (modern Welsh "Cynddelw"), a given name, as in Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr (Kyndelw Brydyt Maur). The Kendal Mountain Festival is an annual festival held in the town of Kendal, Cumbria on the edge of the English Lake District in the UK. It is one of the most diverse festivals of its kind in the world, attracting film premières from around the globe. Filmmakers, TV producers, adventurers, top brands, athletes and speakers gather to take part in four days of the films, talks, books and exhibitions covering all aspects of mountain and adventure sports culture. It is also the main social event for outdoor enthusiasts in the UK. The British Mountaineering Council states that it "is by far the largest and most varied event of its type in Europe and it's the main social event for outdoor enthusiasts in the UK." Windermere Hotel , originally The Riggs Windermere, is a hotel in Windermere, Cumbria, England, located near Windermere railway station. The hotel opened at the time that the railway link with Kendal was established in 1847. It overlooks the A591 road. North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe is a light rail and commuter rail station in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States served by the Green Line of Utah Transit Authority's (UTA) TRAX light rail system and by the "FrontRunner", UTA's commuter rail train that operates along the Wasatch Front with service from Pleasant View in northern Weber County through Ogden, Davis County, Salt Lake City, and Salt Lake County to Provo in central Utah County. The Green Line provides service from the Salt Lake City International Airport to West Valley City (via Downtown Salt Lake City) and connects with the rest of the TRAX system and UTA's S Line streetcar. Although the official name of the station is "North Temple Bridge/Guadalupe", it often referenced by UTA as simply North Temple. Windermere is a town and civil parish in the South Lakeland District of Cumbria, England. It has a population of 8,245 increasing to 8,359 at the 2011 Census, and lies about half a mile (1 km) away from the lake, Windermere. Although the town Windermere does not touch the lake (it took the name of the lake when the railway line was built in 1847 and the station was called "Windermere"), it has now grown together with the older lakeside town of Bowness-on-Windermere, though the two retain distinguishable town centres. Tourism is popular in the town owing to its proximity to the lake and local scenery. Boats from the piers in Bowness sail around the lake, many calling at Ambleside or at Lakeside where there is a restored railway. Windermere Hotel opened at the same time as the railway. Kendal Black Drop was a drug based on opium. Named after Kendal in the Lake District, England, it is associated with the romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In the United Kingdom, National Rail is the trading name licensed for use by the Rail Delivery Group, an unincorporated association whose membership consists of the passenger train operating companies (TOCs) of the island of Great Britain that run the passenger services previously provided by the British Railways Board, from 1965 using the brand name British Rail. Northern Ireland, which is linked to the Republic of Ireland, has a different system. National Rail generally does not include services that do not have a BR history; this distinction is important because National Rail services share a ticketing structure and inter-availability that do not necessarily extend to other services. The name and the accompanying double arrow symbol are the intellectual property of the Secretary of State for Transport. Kendal , anciently known as Kirkby in Kendal or Kirkby Kendal, is a market town and civil parish within the South Lakeland District of Cumbria, England. Historically in Westmorland, it is situated about 8 mi south-east of Windermere, 19 mi north of Lancaster, 23 mi north-east of Barrow-in-Furness and 38 mi north-west of Skipton. The town lies in the valley or "dale" of the River Kent, from which it derives its name, and has a total resident population of 28,586, making it the third largest settlement in Cumbria behind Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness. The Castle Dairy is a medieval building located in Kendal, Cumbria. The name implies a connection to Kendal Castle and it is possibly the town's oldest continuously inhabited structure. Chawinda is a town of the tehsil Pasrur of Sialkot District in the Punjab province of Pakistan. It is located at 32°23'08.05" N 74°42'43.94" E with an altitude of 165 metres (544 feet).

The Missouri Photo Workshop is an annual week-long photojournalism school based in Lee Hills Hall at the Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia, Missouri. Founded in 1949 by the "Father of Photojournalism" Cliff Edom along with American economist, federal government official, and photographer Roy Stryker and photographer Russell Lee, the workshop originally sought to instruct others in photojournalism based on the "gritty, content-rich photographs" produced by the pre-World War II (pre-1939) Farm Security Administration, a United States government effort during the Great Depression to combat American rural poverty. Following Edom's credo - "Show truth with a camera. Ideally truth is a matter of personal integrity. In no circumstances will a posed or faked photograph be tolerated." - each workshop originates in a different small town in Missouri, which is used as a backdrop for attendees from the United States and other countries to work on photograph storytelling methods such as research, observation, and timing. Missouri Photo Workshop faculty members have included the White House's first photo editor and NPPA Picture Editor of the Year Sandra Eisert and other prominent photojournalists.

**Answer:** Nick Cassavetes

**Context:**
Ae Fond Kiss… (also known as "Just a Kiss" in some countries) is a 2004 romantic drama film directed by Ken Loach, and starring Atta Yaqub and Eva Birthistle.

Garner had been 29 years old at the beginning of the original series and was 50 while filming "The New Maverick". The TV-movie was a pilot for the series "Young Maverick", which featured Frank and only lasted a few episodes. Directed by Hy Averback and written by Juanita Bartlett, the movie was filmed while Garner's series "The Rockford Files" was on hiatus.

The former, an action drama, received highly positive reviews, with critics marking the improvement in his performance, while the latter, a melodrama, received mixed reviews, but did well at the box office. "Aadi" also did well financially, becoming the third highest-grossing film of 2002. He acted in two films in 2003, "Naaga", and "Simhadri". While the former was a forgettable film, the latter became a huge blockbuster. The success of "Simhadri" not only cemented his position in Tollywood, but also led to him selecting scripts with similar roles. He followed this success by portraying leading roles in a series of critical and commercial failures, including "Andhrawala" (2004), "Samba" (2004), "Naa Alludu" (2005), "Narasimhudu" (2005), and "Ashok" (2006), leading critics to believe that his career was over.

It later continued in the role of official residence and office of the Governor-General following political independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. Government House was once a Quaker Plantation, until it was purchased by the Imperial Government, when it acted as a replacement to The Bagatelle Great House in the Parish of St. Thomas. Eastcliff is a 20-room house overlooking the Mississippi River in St. Paul, Minnesota, which serves as the official residence of the president of the University of Minnesota system. It was first built in 1922 by local lumber magnate Edward Brooks Sr. and donated to the university by the Brooks family in 1958, beginning its service as the president's official residence in 1960 when O. Meredith Wilson took the position. In 2000, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Today, it is the most-visited public residence in the state (outpacing the Minnesota Governor's Residence), often hosting events five days a week. 6,800 people were recorded attending 159 events in 2005. Stokely Webster (1912 – 2001) was best known as an American impressionist painter who studied in Paris.

**Question:** A molera is a "hole" in the head of a breed of dog that comes in two what?
**Answer:** coat lengths

**Context:**
Push-Button Kitty is a 1952 one-reel animated cartoon and is the 70th "Tom and Jerry" short directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and produced by Fred Quimby. This is the last cartoon to feature Mammy Two Shoes. Mammy Two Shoes (for whom this cartoon has marked the final appearance for) is sweeping the floor and while Tom is relaxing near Jerry's mouse hole, not caring or noticing as Jerry comes out, then returns with a piece of cheese. Mammy then receives a package she has been expecting. She opens it to reveal Mechano, a talented robotic cat, just the opportunity to downside Tom after his laziness. In disbelief, both Tom and Jerry laugh out loud. Mammy then turns on Mechano with the remote control, and it immediately darts to the mouse, hits him with a hammer, and slingshots him out through the window. Mammy then laughs while the unwanted cat packs up and leaves the house. Mammy praises Mechano on its job. Jerry tries to get back into his hole in defiance, using various disguises to elude the computerised cat, but his efforts are no match for Mechano's every thwarting gadget. Knowing that he cannot win by himself, Jerry inserts a series of clockwork mice under the door slot to create a diversion for Mechano. Mechano starts to attack the mice and the house as soon as it detects them, but goes haywire and chops up the piano with an axe, breaks the china with his cannon, saws a table with a buzzsaw, and launches dynamite into a mouse hole, causing serious wreckage to the house. Mammy hears all of this, sees Mechano chopping into the floor after one of the mice, and yells at Mechano to stop. However, the computer will only respond to the controller, so nothing happens. Mammy runs around screaming for Tom's help who hears her out. Mammy runs away from the assault as Mechano tries to break through wardrobes and doors to chase the "mice" and ends up crashing and breaking himself to pieces. Mechano's computer hub, unfortunately, gets accidentally swallowed by Tom just before the maid reaches him. Mammy, with great relief, welcomes the cat back into the house, grateful to have him back on mouse-catching duties. However, Jerry gets the last laugh when he turns Mechano's remote control on causing Tom to "transform" into "Mechano". The terrified housemaid watches helplessly and starts screaming as the mechanised Tom activates and goes on a path of destruction as the cartoon draws to an end. The Alaunt is an extinct breed of dog, with the original breed having existed in central Asia and Europe from ancient times through the 17th century. The Alaunt breed had three distinct phenotypes: Alaunt Veantre, Alaunt Boucherie and the Alaunt Gentile. They all were large, short coated dogs of varying head-types. The former two resembled the molosser type dogs much like the present-day Dogo Argentino or like the Caucasian Shepherd Dog except with short hair and a mesocephalic head which made them excellent large-game hunters. The Alaunt was originally bred by the Alani tribes, the nomads of Indo-European Sarmatian ancestry who spoke an Iranian language. The Alans were known as superb warriors, herdsmen, and breeders of horses and dogs. The Alans bred their dogs for work and developed different strains within the breed for specific duties. The breed was further developed in Spain, France, Germany, England, and in Italy. The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family. Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused. The chizer is a mixed dog breed originating in the United States of America. Chizers are a mix of the Chihuahua and the miniature schnauzer. This breed is NOT recognized by the American Kennel Club. The chizer has a combination of looks from both breeds of dogs, and can vary depending upon the breakdown of the breed. General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights. The Wetterhoun (FCI No.221, translated into English as the Frisian Water Dog) is a breed of dog traditionally used as a hunting dog for hunting small mammals and waterfowl in the province of Fryslan in the Netherlands. The name of the dog comes from the West Frisian "Wetterhûn" meaning "water dog." Plural of Wetterhoun is Wetterhounen in Dutch. The breed may also be called the "Otterhoun" (not to be confused with the Otterhound) or "Dutch Spaniel", although it is not a Spaniel-type dog. The Chihuahua (Spanish: "chihuahueño" ) is the smallest breed of dog and is named after the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. Chihuahuas come in a wide variety of colors, and two coat lengths. The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a "red" or "blue" dog. It should not be confused with the Australian Shepherd, a similarly named but totally different breed. The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game. It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen years. They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to "rage syndrome", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller "cockers" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or "spring," game. In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term "Springer" comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air. A molera is a "hole" in a Chihuahua's head; it is the same as a fontanelle in human babies. Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a "hole in the head". In times past, this has been accepted as a mark of purity for this dog breed, and it is still mentioned in most Chihuahua breed standards the world over. The bones of the head in all foetuses are not firmly knitted together, but in most mammals, the different bones of the skull join with cartilaginous sutures as the animal matures. The Chihuahuas' moleras vary in size and shape, occurring on the top of the head where the parietal and frontal bones come together. The Akita (秋田犬 , Akita-inu, Akita-ken ) is a large breed of dog originating from the mountainous northern regions of Japan. There are two separate varieties of Akita: a "Japanese" strain, commonly called "Akita Ken" in Japan, "Akita Inu" ("inu" means "dog" in Japanese), or "Japanese Akita"; and an "American" strain, known as the "Akita" or "American Akita". The Japanese strain called the Akita Inu comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain known simply as the Akita comes in all dog colors. The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.

**Question:** When was the Chief Aerodynamicist for the British supersonic land vehicle, whose goal is to match or exceed 1000 mph achieving a new world land speed record, born?
**Answer:** 1932

**Context:**
Sir Henry O'Neil de Hane Segrave (22 September 1896 – 13 June 1930) was an early British pioneer in land speed and water speed records. Seagrave, who set three land and one water record, was the first person to hold both titles simultaneously and the first person to travel at over 200 mph in a land vehicle. He died in an accident in 1930 shortly after setting a new world water speed record on Windermere in the Lake District, England. The Segrave Trophy was established to commemorate his life. Bluebird Mach 1.1 (CMN-8) was a design for a rocket-powered supersonic land speed record car, planned by Donald Campbell but thwarted by his subsequent death during a water speed record attempt in "Bluebird K7" in early 1967. Stan Barrett (born June 26, 1943) is a Hollywood stuntman, stunt coordinator and actor. His biggest act was however outside the movie world. On December 17, 1979, he attempted to break the Land Speed Record, and the sound barrier in the Budweiser Rocket rocket-powered three-wheel vehicle. His calculated speed was 739.666 miles per hour, (Mach 1.01), which would have made Barrett the first man to break the sound barrier in a land vehicle. The attempt was surrounded by controversy and the speed was never officially recorded. Barrett also raced in 19 Winston Cup Series races between 1980 and 1990, posting two top ten finishes. Ernest Arthur Douglas Eldridge (18 July 1897 – 27 October 1937) was a British racing car driver who broke the world land speed record in 1924. His was the last land speed record set on an open road. Ronald Ayers, MBE (born 1932) is an English engineer who was responsible for the aerodynamics of the land speed record-holding vehicles, ThrustSSC and JCB Dieselmax, and is Chief Aerodynamicist for the Bloodhound SSC. The land speed record (or absolute land speed record) is the highest speed achieved by a person using a vehicle on land. There is no single body for validation and regulation; in practice the Category C ("Special Vehicles") flying start regulations are used, officiated by regional or national organizations under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The land speed record (LSR) is standardized as the speed over a course of fixed length, averaged over two runs (commonly called "passes"). Two runs are required in opposite directions within one hour, and a new record mark must exceed the previous one by at least one percent to be validated. The Budweiser Rocket was an American 3-wheeled land vehicle, generally resembling the 1970-era "Blue Flame" land speed record holding vehicle in appearance, powered by a hybrid liquid and solid-fuel rocket engine with an extra booster from a Sidewinder missile, that has been claimed as being the first vehicle to have broken the sound barrier on land. The original forerunner to the vehicle was the "SMI Motivator" which was damaged badly enough to require a replacement, which in time was called the "Budweiser Rocket". Arthur Eugene "Art" Arfons (February 3, 1926 – December 3, 2007) was the world land speed record holder three times from 1964 to 1965 with his "Green Monster" series of jet-powered cars, after a series of "Green Monster" piston-engine and jet-engined dragsters. He subsequently went on to field a succession of "Green Monster" turbine-engined pulling tractors, before returning to land speed record racing. He was announced as a 2008 inductee in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame three days after his death. Golden Arrow was a land speed record racer built in Britain to regain the world land speed record from USA. Henry Segrave drove the car at Daytona Beach and exceeded the previous record by 24 mph or 39 km/h. Bloodhound SSC is a British supersonic land vehicle currently in development. Its goal is to match or exceed 1000 mph achieving a new world land speed record. The pencil-shaped car, powered by a jet engine and a rocket engine is designed to reach 1050 mph . It is being developed and built with the intention of breaking the land speed record by 33%, the largest ever margin.

**Question:** The football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United during what timeframe?
**Answer:** from 1986 to 2013

**Context:**
Joshua Parlby (born 1855 in Longton, Staffordshire) was an English football manager who managed Manchester City in the 1890s. The 1996 FA Charity Shield (also known as the Littlewoods FA Charity Shield for sponsorship reasons) was the 74th FA Charity Shield, an annual football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions. The match was played on 11 August 1996 at Wembley Stadium and contested by Manchester United, who had won the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in 1995–96, and Newcastle United, who had finished as runners-up in the Premier League. Manchester United won the match 4–0 with goals from Eric Cantona, Nicky Butt, David Beckham and Roy Keane. The Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex is a public leisure centre located in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is named in honour of Sir Matt Busby, the football manager who was born in Bellshill in 1909, managed Manchester United from 1945 to 1969 and died in 1994. James Ernest Mangnall (4 January 1866 – 13 January 1932) was an English football manager who started his career with Burnley and managed Manchester United between 1903–1912 and then went on to manage Manchester City from 1912–1924, and is the only man to date to have managed both clubs. The David Beckham Academy was a football school founded by England international David Beckham in 2005. In 2009 it operated in two locations: in London, United Kingdom, and in Los Angeles, California, United States. The academy pulled out of the London site at the end of the lease in October 2009, and the California branch closed soon after. The 1995–96 season was Manchester United's fourth season in the Premier League, and their 21st consecutive season in the top division of English football. United finished the season by becoming the first English team to win the Double (league title and FA Cup) twice. Their triumph was made all the more remarkable by the fact that Alex Ferguson had sold experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis before the start of the season, and not made any major signings. Instead, he had drafted in young players like Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil. The Class of '92 is a 2013 British documentary film, released on 1 December 2013. The film centres on the rise of six young Manchester United footballers – David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes – and details their careers for Manchester United starting in 1992. David Beckham's Soccer USA was a football highlights and general discussion show presented by Tim Lovejoy and produced and broadcast in the United Kingdom by Five. The show began following David Beckham's move to Los Angeles Galaxy, and Beckham often contributes to the show in the form of Interviews. Each week there was a special guest in the studio, usually a British sports personality, to whom Lovejoy chatted about their career and their views on Major League Soccer. A slightly different version of the show hosted by Natalie Pinkham and completely devoid of any content derived from British studio footage was broadcast in the USA on Fox Soccer Channel. Sir Alexander Matthew Busby, CBE, KCSG (26 May 1909 – 20 January 1994) was a Scottish football player and manager, who managed Manchester United between 1945 and 1969 and again for the second half of the 1970–71 season. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest managers of all time. His managerial records and longevity at the helm of Manchester United are surpassed only by Sir Alex Ferguson. Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson, CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and player who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is regarded by many players, managers and analysts to be one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time.

**Question:** The HTC U11 major carrier is Sprint, but it can be unlocked for this Texas company that is world's largest telecommunications provider? 
**Answer:** AT&T

**Context:**
Sunrise Communications AG (commonly known as Sunrise), is a Swiss telecommunications provider based in Zurich. It has 2.99 million customers making it the second largest telecommunications company in Switzerland after Swisscom. It provides mobile and landline phone and internet services. Since March 2010, Sunrise headquarters is located at Binzmühlestrasse 130 in Zurich after moving there from the "Sunrise Tower". Formerly a subsidiary of TDC A/S, Sunrise had been owned by CVC Capital Partners until 2015. In February 2015, CVC realised an IPO on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Since then, Sunrise stocks are publicly traded at the Swiss Stock Exchange. CANTV (BVC: TDV.D) is one of the first telephone service enterprises in Venezuela, founded in 1930. The company was re-nationalized in 2007 and is the largest telecommunications provider in Venezuela. T-2 is the second largest telecommunications provider in Slovenia. It was established on 11 May 2004. The HTC U11 is an Android smartphone manufactured and sold by HTC as part of the HTC U series. It was announced on 16 May 2017 and succeeds the HTC 10 smartphone. In the US, the HTC U11's major carrier is Sprint, however it is also compatible with unlocked carriers, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon networks. Telecommunications in the United Arab Emirates is under the control and supervision of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) which was established under UAE Federal Law by Decree No. 3 of 2003. From 1976 to 2006 the Emirates Telecommunications Corporation (Etisalat) was the sole telephone and telecommunications provider for the UAE. And while there were exceptions for free zones and modern housing developments, for the majority of the UAE, Etisalat held a monopoly on business and personal telecommunications services. In February 2006, this monopoly became a duopoly when a new telephone company and Internet service provider (ISP), du, was established to offer mobile services across the UAE and Internet and TV services to some free zone areas. However, due to geographical distribution of service areas, the companies do not compete for customers and thus effectively operate as monopolies. Earlier du provided triple play services to free zone areas under the name Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company (EITC), which is still its legal name. A telecommunications lease is a lease that exists between a telecommunications provider or wireless company, and a landowner. Similar to other real estate leases, a telecommunications lease is put in place as an agreement to lease space on the landowner’s property for a telecommunications site or cellular tower for a specified length of time. In exchange for the use of space, the telecommunications provider (also referenced as a tenant) agrees to pay the landowner (a monthly or annual) rent. Telecom leases can be excellent sources of ancillary income, in some cases providing the landowner with thousands of dollars per month.

**Question:** The term Moneybomb was coined by Trevor Lyman to describe a massive online donation drive on behalf of a presidential candidate that was the first chairman of what PAC? 
**Answer:** Citizens for a Sound Economy

**Context:**
Alhaji Samuel Sidique Sam-Sumana (born April 7, 1962) was a Sierra Leonean politician who was the Vice President of Sierra Leone from September 17, 2007 to March 17, 2015. Sam-Sumana stood as the vice-presidential candidate of the All People's Congress (APC) in the 2007 presidential election, alongside presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma. The APC ticket defeated the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) presidential candidate Solomon Berewa and vice presidential candidate Momodou Koroma. Sam-Sumana took office as Vice President on September 17, 2007. The Social-Democratic Party of Abkhazia (Russian: Социал-демократическая партия Абхазии , Georgian: სოციალურ დემოკრატიული პარტიის აფხაზეთის ) is an oppositional political party in Abkhazia. It was founded during the crisis that followed the October 2004 presidential election by people from the presidential campaign of Sergei Shamba, who had come third in the election. Besides Shamba himself, initial members included his Vice Presidential candidate Vladimir Arshba, chief of staff Gennady Alamia and former Vice Premier Albert Topolian. The foundational congress of the Social-Democratic Party took place on 15 October 2005 in the State Drama Theatre of Abkhazia, where Gennadi Alamia was elected its first chairman. The Union of Social-Democratic Youth was founded as the party's youth wing, headed by Abkhazian State University student Astamur Logua. Mohamed Yahya Sillah was born December 12, 1949 in Massam Kpaka, Pujehun District, Republic of Sierra Leone. His father, Alhaji Yahya Sillah, now 100 years old, served as Regent Chief (Acting Paramount Chief) for several years in Dama Chiefdom, Kenema District in the early seventies. Alhaji Yahya Sillah was appointed to that high position by Sierra Leone President Siaka Stevens. His mother, Haja Mamie Zoe Mansaray, was a home maker. A journalist and human rights activist, Mohamed Yahya Sillah was a vocal torch-bearer in the transition efforts from military to civilian rule in Sierra Leone, 1996. As Leader and National Chairman of National Alliance Democratic Party (NADP), he competed the 1996 Presidential elections in Sierra Leone, becoming one of only thirteen political leaders that qualified to contest the Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the country at the age of 46. His adoring personality lured many Sierra Leoneans and media practitioners to view him as one of the most eloquent and charismatic politicians in Sierra Leone. Nevertheless, he received only 0.5% of the votes (3,723 total votes), good for 13th place. Although he protested the election results on BBC's Focus on Africa, he later suspended his protest "for the sake of peace." Mohamed Yahya Sillah continues to enjoy massive support from the youth and women supporters in Sierra Leone. In 2007, he withdrew his bid for national leadership in the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, citing inadequate funding and ineffective campaign management machinery. He later put his weight behind the Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP) presidential candidate, Vice President Solomon Berewa. When Berewa lost the elections, Mohamed Yahya Sillah gracefully congratulated the winning candidate, Ernest Bai Koroma, of the All People's Congress (APC) party. Mohamed Yahya Sillah vows to respect and help protect the dignity of any Sierra Leonean that is legitimately and democratically elected to office by the people of Sierra Leone. Two-stage presidential elections were held in Finland in 1931. On 15 and 16 January the public elected presidential electors to an electoral college. They in turn elected the President. The result was a victory for Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, who won on the third ballot by just two votes. The turnout for the popular vote was 47.3%. This presidential election was held during an ideologically, politically, socially and economically tense time. The Great Depression was impoverishing many Finnish farmers and workers. The far-right Lapua Movement had not settled for the ban of the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations in the autumn of 1930. It wanted to help elect a President who would also strongly oppose the Social Democrats and moderate bourgeois parties, such as the Progressives. Although Svinhufvud disapproved of the Lapua Movement's violent kidnappings of left-wing politicians and other illegal acts, he was their preferred presidential candidate. Former President K.J. Ståhlberg, a champion of democracy, parliamentarism and the rule of law, had been briefly kidnapped by some activists of the Lapua Movement with his wife in October 1930. He was chosen as the Progressive presidential candidate. Speaker of the Finnish Parliament, Kyösti Kallio, held ideals similar to those of Ståhlberg, and he became the Agrarian presidential candidate. The outgoing President, Lauri Kristian Relander, had lost the Agrarian presidential candidacy to Kallio, because he did not condemn the Lapua Movement as strongly as Kallio did, and a sufficient number of Agrarians believed that Kallio could control the Lapua Movement's extremists more effectively than Relander. Right-wing Finns and some centrists, such as a prominent Agrarian parliamentarian, Juho Niukkanen, were concerned that Ståhlberg's re-election (after a six-year break) as the Finnish President would escalate political tensions in Finland. The Commander-in-Chief of the Civil Guards (a bourgeois voluntary defence organization), Major General Lauri Malmberg, announced in the Finnish Parliament that he would not guarantee order among the Civil Guards, if Ståhlberg was elected President. Svinhufvud's razor-thin victory required Niukkanen's arm-twisting tactics, whereby he pressured all the Agrarian presidential electors to support Svinhufvud. This 69-year-old and slightly ailing conservative politician was considered by his supporters as a sufficiently bold, solid and patriotic man to re-unite the ideologically divided Finns. His pro-democracy supporters hoped that he could keep both right-wing extremists and left-wing extremists in check (see, for example, Sakari Virkkunen, Finland's Presidents I / Suomen presidentit I. Helsinki: Otava Ltd., 1994, pgs. 242-245 (Relander), pgs. 11-14 (Svinhufvud); Pentti Virrankoski, A History of Finland / Suomen historia, volumes 1&2. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society / Suomalaisen kirjallisuuden seura, 2009, pgs. 810-816; Raimo Salokangas, "The Independent Republic" (Itsenäinen tasavalta), pgs. 635-639 in Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., A Small Giant of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen. Helsinki: WSOY, 2003). Ronald Ernest Paul (born August 20, 1935) is an American author, physician, and former politician. He was the U.S. Representative for Texas' 14th and 22nd congressional districts. He represented the 22nd congressional district from 1976 to 1977 and from 1979 to 1985, and then represented the 14th congressional district, which included Galveston, from 1997 to 2013. On three occasions, he sought the presidency of the United States: as the Libertarian Party nominee in 1988 and as a candidate in the Republican primaries of 2008 and 2012. Paul is a critic of the federal government's fiscal policies, especially the existence of the Federal Reserve and the tax policy, as well as the military–industrial complex, and the War on Drugs. Paul has also been a vocal critic of mass surveillance policies such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the NSA surveillance programs. Paul was the first chairman of the conservative PAC Citizens for a Sound Economy and has been characterized as the "intellectual godfather" of the Tea Party movement. The third primary election of the Citizens' Action Party (PAC, known as "Convención Nacional Ciudadana" or "Citizens' National Convention") was scheduled for July 9, 2017 in order to elect PAC's presidential candidate for the Costa Rican general election, 2018. Albeit rumors about possible candidates included former candidate and deputy Otton Solis, current Vice-President Ana Helena Chacón and former president of Congress and current UN ambassador Juan Carlos Mendoza, all of them denied having aspirations for the moment. Instead the first announcing his intention to be nominated was Minister Carlos Alvarado, former Minister of Social Issues and President of the Joint Social Welfare Institute and latter Minister of Labor under Luis Guillermo Solis' presidency. He was quickly followed by Economy Minister Welmer Ramos, both resigning their offices as the Constitution requires before February 2017. Congresswoman and former pre-candidate Epsy Campbell made her intentions public on March of the same year in what could have been Campbell's third attempt to be presidential nominee. But on March 27 Campbell withdraw from the race. Trevor Morris Lyman (born 1970) is an American musician and internet music entrepreneur. Lyman popularized such political campaign concepts as moneybombs and dedicated political blimp advertising. He helped organize grassroots fundraising for 2008 United States Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, Congressman from Texas by offering to create a hub website after supporters of the candidate decided a "money bomb" would be an effective way to bring in campaign donations. Two-stage presidential elections were held in Finland in 1978, the first since 1968 after Urho Kekkonen's term was extended by four years by Parliament. The public elected presidential electors to an electoral college on 15 and 16 January. They in turn elected the President. The result was a victory for Urho Kekkonen, who won on the first ballot. The turnout for the popular vote was 64.3. Kekkonen had in the spring of 1975 agreed to become the Social Democratic presidential candidate, and after that all the major Finnish political parties chose him as their candidate. Kekkonen's opponents, such as the Christian League's presidential candidate Raino Westerholm, claimed that Kekkonen's long presidency weakened the Finnish democracy. Over one-third of the Finnish voters abstained from voting, partly as a protest against Kekkonen's expected landslide victory. The 77-year-old President Kekkonen's health was already declining, although this fact was not easily noticeable in his public appearances (see, for example, Timo Vihavainen, "The Welfare Finland" (Hyvinvointi-Suomi), pgs. 883-884 in Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., A Small Giant of the Finnish History / Suomen historian pikkujättiläinen. Helsinki: WSOY, 2003; Pentti Virrankoski, A History of Finland / Suomen historia, volumes 1&2. Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society (Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura), 2009, pg. 963; Aarno Laitinen et al., eds., Tamminiemi's Inheritance Dividers (Tamminiemen pesänjakajat). Helsinki: Journalists Ltd. (Lehtimiehet Oy), 1981). Willie Mae Reid is an African-American politician who ran as the Socialist Workers Party candidate for Mayor of Chicago in 1975, winning 16,693 votes but coming in third place against Richard J. Daley. The number had fallen from the number of signatures she'd acquired to get on the ballot, 66,000. She also ran as their vice presidential candidate in 1976 (Presidential candidate: Peter Camejo) and 1992 (Presidential candidate: James "Mac" Warren), winning 91,314 votes. Moneybomb (alternatively money bomb, money-bomb, or fundraising bomb) is a neologism coined in 2007 to describe a grassroots fundraising effort over a brief fixed time period, usually to support a candidate for election by dramatically increasing, concentrating, and publicizing fundraising activity during a specific hour or day. The term was coined by Trevor Lyman to describe a massive coordinated online donation drive on behalf of presidential candidate Ron Paul, in which context the "San Jose Mercury News" described a moneybomb as being "a one-day fundraising frenzy". The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals focusing especially on viral advertising through online vehicles such as YouTube, Myspace, and online forums. In the case of lesser-known candidates it is also intended to generate significant free mass media coverage the candidate would otherwise not receive. Moneybombs have been used for grassroots fundraising and viral activism over the Internet by several 2008 presidential candidates in the United States. It emerged as an important grassroots tool leading up to the 2010 midterm elections and 2012 presidential election in the United States.

**Question:** 100 indviduals with the surname 'Preradovic' died at which concentration camp that straddled the southern border of the Hasburg Monarchy?
**Answer:** the Jasenovac concentration camp

**Context:**
The Bardufoss concentration camp is located in Northern Norway in the municipality of Målselv. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the Nazi authorities established a "concentration camp in the town of Bardufoss," as an annex to the Grini concentration camp. It opened in March 1944 to alleviate overflowing in other camps, particularly Grini and the Falstad concentration camp. Situated in a cold climate, it was notorious for its hard work regime, sparse rations, and inadequate shelter. It is estimated that some 800 prisoners passed through the camp, and when liberated about 550 were incarcerated. Ohrdruf concentration camp was a Nazi forced labor and concentration camp located near Ohrdruf, south of Gotha, in Thuringia, Germany. It was part of the Buchenwald concentration camp network and the first Nazi concentration camp liberated by U.S. troops. The Esterwegen concentration camp near Esterwegen was an early Nazi concentration camp within a series of camps first established in the Emsland district of Germany. It was established in the summer of 1933 as a concentration camp for 2000 so-called political "Schutzhäftlinge" (protective custody prisoners) and was for a time the second largest concentration camp after Dachau. The camp was closed in summer of 1936. Until 1945 the camp was used as a prison camp. Political prisoners and so called "Nacht und Nebel"-prisoners were also held here. Then Esterwegen served as a British internment camp, as a prison, and, until 2000, as a depot for the German Army. The Lobor concentration camp or Loborgrad camp (Croatian: "Koncentracioni logor Lobor" ) was a concentration camp established in Lobor, Independent State of Croatia (modern-day Croatia) in the deserted palace of Keglevich family. It was established on 9 August 1941, mostly for Serb and Jewish children and women. The camp was established and operated by Ustaše, with 16 of its guards being members of the local Volksdeutsche community. Its inmates were subjected to systematic torture, robbery and murder of "undisciplined" individuals. All younger female inmates of the Lobor camp were subjected to rapes. More than 2,000 people were inmates of this camp, at least 200 died in it. All survived children and women were transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in August 1942 where they all were killed. Breslau-Dürrgoy concentration camp or KZ Dürrgoy was a short-lived Nazi German concentration camp set up in the southern part of Wrocław (German: "Breslau" ), then in Germany, before World War II on the grounds of the old fertilizer factory "Silesia". It was located in what, since 1945, has become known as the Tarnogaj neighbourhood of Wrocław (German: "Dürrgoy" ), at the Strehlener Chaussee or Strzeliński Street (today ul. Bardzka), opposite the cemetery of the Holy Ghost. The camp, intended for the opponents of Nazism, was established at a place of the former POW camp for French prisoners of World War I, converted and utilized by the fertilizer factory. The new camp was founded on the initiative of the commander of SA in Silesia, "SA-Obergruppenführer" Edmund Heines, on 12 March 1933, and liquidated on 10 August 1933 with all prisoners transported to a larger concentration camp at Osnabrück. Herzogenbusch concentration camp (Dutch: "Kamp Vught" , ] , German: "Konzentrationslager Herzogenbusch" ] ) was a Nazi concentration camp located in Vught near the city of 's-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands. Herzogenbusch was, with Natzweiler-Struthof in occupied France, the only concentration camp run directly by the SS in western Europe outside of Germany. The camp was first used in 1943 and held 31,000 prisoners. 749 prisoners died in the camp, and the others were transferred to other camps shortly before the camp was liberated by the Allied Forces in 1944. After the war the camp was used as a prison for Germans and Dutch collaborators. Today there is a visitors' center with exhibitions and a national monument remembering the camp and its victims. The camp is now a museum. Erich Zoddel (August 9, 1913 – November 30, 1945) was a prisoner functionary at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. In 1941, Zoddel was sentenced to a year in prison for theft before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1942. He worked as a forced laborer in the Heinkel factory in Oranienburg until October 1943. In November 1943, after a brief stay at Buchenwald concentration camp, he was taken to Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. On 27 March 1944, Zoddel and 1,000 other prisoners from Mittelbau-Dora arrived at Bergen-Belsen. By January 1945, Zoddel had risen in the ranks to a camp division. Two days after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by the British army on 15 April 1945, Zoddel killed a female detainee, a crime for which he was sentenced to death by a British military court in Celle on 31 August 1945. On 17 November 1945, Zoddel was sentenced to life imprisonment in a second trial for his actions at Bergen-Belsen. His execution was carried out later that month in Wolfenbüttel. The Military Frontier was a province straddling the southern borderland of the Habsburg Monarchy and later the Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Empire. It acted as the "cordon sanitaire" against incursions from the Ottoman Empire. The Đakovo concentration camp (Croatian: "Đakovo koncentracioni logor" ) was a concentration camp established in 1941 in Đakovo, Independent State of Croatia (modern-day Croatia). It was established in the deserted flour mill "Cereale" owned by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Đakovo although the Đakovo bishop, supported by Archbishop of Zagreb Aloysius Stepinac, firmly opposed the idea of Ustaše to establish a concentration camp within the borders of the Bishop's domain. The camp was established on 1 December 1941 mainly for Jewish women and children, including some Serb girls. It was operational until its disestablishment on 7 July 1942. Around 3,000 women and children were its inmates and subjected to beatings, rapes, dog attacks and death from sickness and starvation. At least 650 women and children died in it. During the camp's disestablishment, the remaining inmates were transported to other camps and killed. Preradović () is a Serbian surname, derived from "Prerad". The surname is traditionally widespread in territories of the historical Military Frontier. At least 100 individuals with the surname died at the Jasenovac concentration camp. It may refer to:

**Question:** Which band did this American businessman, music publisher, writers' representative, filmmaker and record label executive manage while simultaneously managing this group of the album "More Hot Rocks?"
**Answer:** the Beatles

**Context:**
Mike Mattison is an American musician and vocalist of the Grammy Award-winning blues rock/soul group, the Tedeschi Trucks Band, as well as lead vocalist and co-founder of the blues rock trio Scrapomatic. Mattison's vocal sound has been described as "strong," with an "expressive blues voice". As lead vocalist of Scrapomatic, he picked up a nomination for Minnesota Music Awards best male vocalist, and both he and co-founder Paul Olsen were also nominated for best R&B Group. Mattison was previously the lead vocalist of the Grammy Award winning Derek Trucks Band and has been a main songwriter of all three bands. He is also an active essayist who publishes on music and poetry. Since 2013 Mattison and Ernest Suarez have edited “Hot Rocks: Songs and Verse,” an ongoing feature in Five Points: A Journal of Literature and Art. Low Transit Industries was an independent record label founded in Melbourne, Australia in 1999 by Darren Smallman (BATTLE WORLDWIDE) and Simon Baird. The label toured and released bands across the world until 2010 when the partners closed operations due to Darren Smallman moving to the UK where he now runs BATTLE WORLDWIDE which is a record label, book publisher, music publisher and PR services company. Sargent House is an American management company and record label based in Los Angeles. It was founded in June 2006 by Cathy Pellow, who is a music video commissioner for Atlantic Records and also owns a music video production company called Refused TV. Pellow began managing the rock outfit RX Bandits in 2006. The band needed to release its new album "...And the Battle Begun", so Pellow decided to launch her own record label (also to be able to do things differently from the traditional model of record labels). From that point onward, Pellow continued to manage bands and release records, all under the Sargent House banner. Bigtop Records was an American record label started by music executive Johnny Bienstock and the major music publisher Hill & Range Music and was co-owned along with Big Top Record Distributors (sic). Hit artists included Del Shannon, Johnny and the Hurricanes, Lou Johnson, Sammy Turner, Don and Juan, and Toni Fisher. Big Top Record Distributors also distributed Paul Case's Dunes Records label in the early 60's, which had hits from Ray Peterson ("Corrina, Corrina") and Curtis Lee ("Pretty Little Angel Eyes"), both records produced by Phil Spector. Bell Records briefly distributed Bigtop prior to the label closing, around 1965. "Bigtop" also released two Mad Magazine music parody themed albums; "Mad Twists Rock 'N' Roll" and "Fink Along With Mad" in 1963. Allen Klein (December 18, 1931 July 4, 2009) was an American businessman, music publisher, writers' representative, filmmaker and record label executive, most noted for his tough persona and aggressive, innovative negotiation tactics, many of which established higher industry standards for compensating recording artists. He founded ABKCO Music & Records Incorporated. Klein revolutionized the income potential of recording artists, who previously had been routinely victimized by onerous record company contracts. He first scored massive monetary and contractual windfalls for Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen, one-hit rockabillies of the late 1950s, then parlayed his early successes into a position managing Sam Cooke, and eventually managed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously, along with many other artists, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the music industry during his era. Howie Klein (born 1950) is an American writer, concert promoter, disc jockey, music producer, record label founder, record label executive, progressive political activist, and adjunct professor of music. He is perhaps best known for his role as President of Reprise Records from 1989 to 2001. He appears occasionally as himself in music-related film documentaries and has received accolades for his stance against censorship and for his advocacy of free speech protection. Bertelsmann Music Group (abbreviated as BMG) was a division of German media company Bertelsmann before its completion of sale of the majority of its assets to Japan's Sony Corporation of America on October 1, 2008.

**Question:** What  profession did Mike Robbie's father practice?
**Answer:** an American attorney

**Context:**
Modern urban planning in Canada can be traced back to the early 1900s, though Indigenous planning, an evolving practice, originated hundreds if not thousands of years ago. The planning profession originally focused on city layout, land subdivision and architecture and grew dramatically after 1945 due to the growth of Canadian cities. The profession now includes a diverse range of subjects such as urban sociology, data analysis and forecasting, municipal and planning law, management sciences and environmental sciences. According to the Canadian Institute of Planners, the profession has grown from only 45 practicing planners in 1949 to about 7,000 practitioners in 2009. This page compiles some of Canada’s most notable planners according to their contributions to the profession. Actuarial Society of Malaysia (Persatuan Aktuari Malaysia), also known as ASM was founded on 5 October 1978. ASM is the only representative body for the actuarial profession in Malaysia. Thus, it is the platform for members of the actuarial profession to raise and discuss technical and public interest issues related to the practice of the profession; to communicate such issues to relevant parties including the public, industry regulators and corporate stakeholders; to provide educational support to actuarial students and professional development to qualified actuaries; and to provide space for members of the profession to build relationships. Professionalization is a social process by which any trade or occupation transforms itself into a true "profession of the highest integrity and competence." The definition of what constitutes a profession is often contested. Professionalization tends to result in establishing acceptable qualifications, one or more professional associations to recommend best practice and to oversee the conduct of members of the profession, and some degree of demarcation of the qualified from unqualified amateurs (that is, professional certification). It is also likely to create "occupational closure", closing the profession to entry from outsiders, amateurs and the unqualified. Optometry is a health care profession which involves examining the eyes and applicable visual systems for defects or abnormalities as well as the medical diagnosis and management of eye disease. Traditionally, the field of optometry began with the primary focus of correcting refractive error through the use of spectacles. Modern day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the education curriculum additionally includes intensive medical training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease in countries where the profession is established and regulated. Optometrists (also known as Doctors of Optometry in the US and Canada for those holding the O.D. degree or Ophthalmic Opticians in the UK) are medical professionals who provide primary eyecare through comprehensive eye examinations to detect and treat various visual abnormalities and eye diseases. Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location. Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to ophthalmologists who are physicians that specialize in tertiary medical and surgical care of the eye. Optometrists typically work closely together with other eye care professionals such as ophthalmologists and opticians to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public. Joseph "Joe" Robbie (July 7, 1916 – January 7, 1990) was an American attorney, politician, and the principle founder of the Miami Dolphins. In sociology, an occupational closure (or professional demarcation) is the process whereby a trade or occupation transforms itself into a true profession by closing off entry to the profession to all but those suitably qualified. The profession then becomes closed to entry from outsiders, amateurs and the unqualified. This can be achieved by licensure, through barring entry to all except those who have passed certain entrance examinations and grades of training, or by allowing entry only to those who have gained membership of a specific professional body. In most professions all three methods are in regular use. What this means in practical terms, is that an architect or physician, for example, will firstly be a university graduate in their main subject, second, will have passed entrance examinations to join a recognised professional body and thirdly, will also be licensed to practise medicine or architecture, usually also obtained through sitting examinations. Therefore, such professions are open only to those who satisfy these requirements and are closed to everyone else. It is thus illegal for any other person to practice medicine or to pose as an architect. The Medical Council of Thailand is the country's professional regulatory body of the medical profession. It operates under the provisions of the Medical Profession Act, B.E. 2525 (1982 CE), which replaced series of earlier legislation dating to the council's foundation in 1923. Under the law, the council is tasked with: upholding the profession's ethics; supporting medical education, research and practice; uniting and upholding the dignity of its members; aiding and educating the general population and organizations on relevant matters; advising the government on medical and public health issues; and representing the medical profession in Thailand. The council is responsible for granting and revoking licences to practice medicine, as well as certification of medical education programmes and degrees. All licensed doctors are members of the council, and are entitled to elect members of its governing body, the Medical Council Committee, and its head, the President of the Medical Council, on a biennial basis. Mike Robbie ( Born April 5, 1943 ), is a former General Manager of the Miami Dolphins and the son of the late Joe Robbie, former owner of the team. The American College of Medical Practice Executives (ACMPE), established in 1956, supports and promotes the personal and professional growth of leaders to advance the medical practice management profession and is the certification and standard-setting body of the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA). Both are headquartered in Englewood, Colo. Nearly 6,000 members strong, ACMPE developed the standard-setting Body of Knowledge for Medical Practice Management. It grants nationally recognized certification and fellowship designations to the most accomplished medical practice executives and leaders in the profession. The National Association for Chiropractic Medicine (NACM) was a minority chiropractic association founded in 1984 that described itself as a "consumer advocacy association of chiropractors". It openly rejected some of the more controversial aspects of chiropractic, including a basic concept of chiropractic, vertebral subluxations as the cause of all diseases. It also sought to "reform the chiropractic profession away from a philosophical scope of practice and towards an applied science scope of practice." It stated that it was "dedicated to bringing the scientific based practice of chiropractic into mainstream medicine" and that its members "confine their scope of practice to scientific parameters and seek to make legitimate the utilization of professional manipulative procedures in mainstream health care delivery." "While the NACM is focused on furthering the profession, its primary focus is on the rights and safety of the consumers." The NACM was the object of much controversy and criticism from the rest of the profession. It quietly dropped out of sight and its demise apparently occurred sometime between May 30, 2008 and March 6, 2010.

**Question:** Who born earlier, Lewis Terman or  G. Stanley Hall?
**Answer:** G. Stanley Hall

**Context:**
The modern academic study of the psychology of religious conversion can be tracked back to 1881 when a series of lectures was delivered by early psychologist G. Stanley Hall. In its early stages the psychology of religious conversion mainly addressed Christianity and to this day is dominated by studies of North American Protestant Christianity, although other varieties of religion are addressed in the field. Maud Amanda Merrill James (April 30, 1888 – January 15, 1978) was an American psychologist. Both an alumna and faculty member of Stanford University, James worked with Lewis Terman to develop the second and third editions of the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales. Una Hunt (born 1876) (full married name Una Hunt Clarke Drage), daughter of prominent geologist Frank Wigglesworth Clarke (1847–1931), was an American author famed in her time for publishing "Una Mary", an autobiographical reconstruction of the inner and outer world of her childhood. G. Stanley Hall, generally credited with discovering the concept of adolescence, considered her along with Marie Bashkirtseff and Mary MacLane to have exposed the world of female adolescent thought and emotion. Psychological Review is a scientific journal that publishes articles on psychological theory. It was founded by Princeton University psychologist James Mark Baldwin and Columbia University psychologist James McKeen Cattell in 1894 as a publication vehicle for psychologists not connected with the Clark laboratory of G. Stanley Hall (who often published in Hall's "American Journal of Psychology"). "Psychological Review" soon became the most prominent and influential psychology journal in North America, publishing important articles by William James, John Dewey, James Rowland Angell, and many others. The Genetic Studies of Genius, today known as the Terman Study of the Gifted, is currently the oldest and longest-running longitudinal study in the field of psychology. It was begun by Lewis Terman at Stanford University in 1921 to examine the development and characteristics of gifted children into adulthood. Lois Barclay Murphy (March 23, 1902 - December 24, 2003) was an American developmental psychologist who had an important impact on the study of normal child development. Murphy was instrumental in changing the ways in which children were viewed in psychology—previous work tended to focus on pathology, while Murphy emphasized more positive and social elements, including normal development and the development of empathy and ethics in children. She collaborated on 16 works with her husband, Gardner Murphy, published a book about his work after his death as well as several on her own work. She founded the Early Childhood Center (EEC), a college laboratory school focused on child development, at St Lawrence College in 1937 which is still in operation today. l Murphy was given the G. Stanley Hall Award in developmental psychology in recognition of her contributions to the field. Granville Stanley Hall (February 1, 1846 – April 24, 1924) was a pioneering American psychologist and educator. His interests focused on childhood development and evolutionary theory. Hall was the first president of the American Psychological Association and the first president of Clark University. A "Review of General Psychology" survey, published in 2002, ranked Hall as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with Lewis Terman. Lewis Madison Terman (January 15, 1877 – December 21, 1956) was an American psychologist and author. He was noted as a pioneer in educational psychology in the early 20th century at the Stanford Graduate School of Education. He is best known for his revision of the Stanford-Binet IQ test and for initiating the longitudinal study of children with high IQs called the Genetic Studies of Genius. He was a prominent eugenicist and was a member of the Human Betterment Foundation. He also served as president of the American Psychological Association. A "Review of General Psychology" survey, published in 2002, ranked Terman as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with G. Stanley Hall. Elsie Maude Stanley Hall (22 June 1877 – 27 June 1976), commonly referred to as Elsie Stanley Hall, was a prominent Australian-born South African classical pianist. William Stern (] ; 29 April 1871 – 27 March 1938), born Louis William Stern, was a German psychologist and philosopher noted as a pioneer in the field of the psychology of personality and intelligence. He was the inventor of the concept of the intelligence quotient, or IQ, later used by Lewis Terman and other researchers in the development of the first IQ tests, based on the work of Alfred Binet. He was the father of the German writer and philosopher Günther Anders. In 1897, Stern invented the tone variator, allowing him to research human perception of sound in an unprecedented way.

**Question:** What chef is the owner of a Japanese restaurant in the Tribeca neighborhood and also owns two Bar Masas in New York and Nevada?
**Answer:** Masayoshi "Masa" Takayama

**Context:**
The Subaru Tribeca is a mid-size crossover SUV sold since 2005 by Subaru. Released in some markets, including Canada, as the Subaru B9 Tribeca, the name "Tribeca" derives from the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. Built on the Subaru Legacy platform and sold in five- and seven-seat configurations, the Tribeca was intended to be sold alongside a slightly revised version known as the Saab 9-6. Saab, at the time a subsidiary of General Motors (GM), abandoned the 9-6 program just prior to its release subsequent to GM's 2005 divestiture of its 20 percent stake in FHI. El Internacional Tapas Bar & Restaurant was conceived as an artistic project and social experiment, carried out between 1984 and 1986 by artist Antoni Miralda and chef Montse Guillén in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It was an initiative merging the cultural contexts of contemporary art and cuisine. The restaurant's popularity and renown would become a daring exploration of cross-cultural, trans-disciplinary esthetics and somehow an iconic symbol of the New York scene of the 80s. The project engaged food, sensorial experiences and installation art as vehicles and rituals for transmitting and subverting traditions and blending social practices of the time. El Internacional was seen as a point of convergence for the artistic community, and, at the same time, as a real place that engaged neighbors and celebrities alike in its culinary inventions and exotic allure. El Internacional was an ongoing process of the almost 3-year day-by-day creation of a work of installation and performance art. Magda Sawon is a contemporary art gallerist and art world figure who founded and owns New York's Postmasters Gallery (with her husband Tamas Banovich), a gallery for young and established contemporary artists, especially those working in new media, in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City.

The hotel's event venues are often used for movie premiers, screenings, and social events. In September 2015 the hotel re-branded and changed its name to The Roxy Hotel. Dinner Rush is a 2000 American independent feature film, written by Brian S. Kalata and Rick Shaughnessy, and directed by Bob Giraldi. It stars Danny Aiello as a restaurateur-bookmaker in New York City's Tribeca neighborhood and Edoardo Ballerini as his son, the restaurant's star chef. The Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris is a luxury hotel located at 37 avenue Hoche, 8th arrondissement, Paris, France.

**Question:**  What annual event occurs on a property co-founded by an American who was the best-selling recording artist of the 20th century?
**Answer:** San Diego County Fair

**Context:**
Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. In 1990, she rose to fame with the release of "Vision of Love" from her eponymous debut album. The album produced four chart-topping singles in the US and began what would become a string of commercially successful albums which solidified the singer as Columbia Records' highest selling act. Carey and Boyz II Men spent a record sixteen weeks atop the "Billboard" Hot 100 in 1995–1996 with "One Sweet Day," which remains the longest-running number-one song in US chart history. Following a contentious divorce from Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and traversed towards hip hop with the release of "Butterfly" (1997). In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards and subsequently named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. The World Series, the modern championship series of Major League Baseball, began in 1903, and was established as an annual event in 1905. Before the formation of the American Association (AA), there were no playoff rounds—all championships went to the team with the best record at the end of the season. In the initial season of the National League (NL) in 1876, there was controversy as to which team was the champion: the Chicago White Stockings, who had the best overall record (52–14), or the St. Louis Brown Stockings (45–19), who were the only team to have a winning record against every other franchise in the league. The teams agreed to play a five-game "Championship of the West" series, won by St. Louis, 4 games to 1. Beginning in 1884, the championship series between the National League and the American Association were promoted and referred to as the "World's Championship Series" (WCS), or "World's Series" for short; however, they are not officially recognized by Major League Baseball as part of World Series history. Though early publications, such as Ernest Lanigan's "Baseball Cyclopedia" and Turkin and Thompson's "Encyclopedia of Baseball", listed the 19th-century games on an equal basis with those of the 20th century, "Sporting News" publications about the World Series, which began in the 1920s, ignored the 19th-century games, as did most publications about the Series after 1960. Major League Baseball, in general, regards 19th-century events as a prologue to the modern era of baseball, which is defined by the emergence of the two present major leagues. William Martin Joel (born May 9, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. He was born in the Bronx, New York, and raised on Long Island, New York, places which have a heavy influence on his songs. Since releasing his first hit song, "Piano Man", in 1973, Joel has become the sixth best-selling recording artist and the third best-selling solo artist in the United States. His compilation album "Greatest Hits Vol. 1 & 2" is one of the best-selling albums in the US. National Sorry Day is an annual event that has been held in Australia on 26 May, since 1998, to remember and commemorate the mistreatment of the country's indigenous population. During the 20th century, Australian governments' policies resulted in a "Stolen Generation" – described by John Torpey as "Aboriginal children separated, often forcibly, from their families in the interest of turning them into white Australians". "True Love" (styled "TRUE LOVE") is a single by Japanese recording artist Fumiya Fujii. It was released on November 10, 1993. It was number-one on the "Oricon" Weekly Singles Chart. It was the 29th best-selling single in Japan in 1993, with 806,000 copies sold, the 11th best-selling single in Japan in 1994, with 1.213 million copies sold and it is the 20th best-selling physical single in Japan, having sold a total of 2.023 million copies. Mitchell William "Mitch" Miller (July 4, 1911 – July 31, 2010) was an American oboist, conductor, recording producer and recording industry executive. He was involved in almost all aspects of the industry, particularly as a conductor, and artist and repertoire (A&R) man. Miller was one of the most influential people in American popular music during the 1950s and early 1960s, both as the head of A&R at Columbia Records and as a best-selling recording artist with an NBC television series, "Sing Along with Mitch". A graduate of the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester in the early 1930s, Miller began his musical career as an accomplished player of the oboe and English horn, making numerous highly regarded classical and popular recordings, but he is best remembered as a choral conductor on television and as a recordings executive. Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby Jr. ( ; May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Crosby's trademark warm bass-baritone voice made him the best-selling recording artist of the 20th century, having sold over one billion records, tapes, compact discs and digital downloads around the world. The Del Mar Fairgrounds is a 370 acre property that is the site of the annual San Diego County Fair (called the Del Mar Fair from 1984 to 2001). Its Del Mar racetrack was built by the Thoroughbred Club in 1937 by founding members Bing Crosby and Pat O'Brien with Paramount Studios as corporate sponsor. Alton Glenn Miller (March 1, 1904 – missing in action December 15, 1944) was an American big band musician, arranger, composer, and bandleader in the swing era. He was the best-selling recording artist from 1939 to 1943, leading one of the best known big bands. Miller's recordings include "In the Mood", "Moonlight Serenade", "Pennsylvania 6-5000", "Chattanooga Choo Choo", "A String of Pearls", "At Last", "(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo", "American Patrol", "Tuxedo Junction", "Elmer's Tune", and "Little Brown Jug". In just four years Glenn Miller scored 23 number one hits - more than Elvis Presley (18 No. 1s, 38 top 10s) and The Beatles (20 No. 1s, 33 top 10s) had in their careers. While he was traveling to entertain U.S. troops in France during World War II, Miller's aircraft disappeared in bad weather over the English Channel. Typewriter in the Sky is a science fiction novel written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The protagonist Mike de Wolf finds himself inside the story of his friend Horace Hackett's book. He must survive conflict on the high seas in the Caribbean during the 17th century, before eventually returning to his native New York City. Each time a significant event occurs to the protagonist in the story he hears the sounds of a typewriter in the sky. At the story's conclusion, de Wolf wonders if he is still a character in someone else's story. The work was first published in a two-part serial format in 1940 in "Unknown Fantasy Fiction". It was twice published as a combined book with Hubbard's work "Fear". In 1995 Bridge Publications re-released the work along with an audio edition.

**Question:** What do Eragrostis and Rhexia have in common?
**Answer:** plant genus

**Context:**
Eragrostis intermedia is a species of grass known by the common name plains lovegrass. It is native to North and Central America, where it is distributed from the southeastern and southwestern United States south to Costa Rica. Its range may extend to South America. Eragrostis curvula is a species of grass known by the common name weeping lovegrass. Other common names include Boer lovegrass, curved lovegrass, Catalina lovegrass, and African lovegrass. Rhexia is a plant genus of Melastomataceae (ca. 4500 species in 150 genera) family. "Rhexia" species are commonly called “meadow beauty” and 11 to 13 species of "Rhexia" have been recognized depending on different taxonomic treatments. Eragrostis is a large and widespread genus of plants in the grass family, found in many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands.

**Question:** What genre of composers were both Claudio Monteverdi and Georges Bizet? 
**Answer:** opera

**Context:**
These lists show the audio and visual recordings of the opera "L'Orfeo" by Claudio Monteverdi. The opera was first performed in Mantua in 1607, at the court of Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga, and is one of the earliest of all operas. The first recording of "L'Orfeo" was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi's music edited by Giacomo Benvenuti, given by the orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio Calusio. In 1949 the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch recorded the complete opera, on long-playing records (LPs). The advent of LP recordings was, as Harold Schonberg later wrote, an important factor in the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of "L'Orfeo" have been issued on many labels. Koch's landmark version was reissued in 1962, when it was compared unfavourably with others that had by then been issued. The 1969 recording by Nicholas Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt's edition based on period instruments, was praised for "making Monteverdi's music sound something like the way he imagined". In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi's 1616 ballet "Tirsi e Clori" for the Bacchante scenes. Among more recent recordings, that of Emmanuelle Haïm has been praised for its dramatic effect. The 21st century has seen the issue of an increasing number of recordings on DVD. The Stattkus-Verzeichnis (SV) is a catalogue of the musical compositions of the Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi. The catalogue was published in 1985 by Manfred H. Stattkus ("Claudio Monteverdi: Verzeichnis der erhaltenen Werke"). A free, basic second edition of the catalogue is available online. John Whenham is an English musicologist and academic who specializes in early Italian baroque music. He earned both a Bachelor of Music and a Master of Music from the University of Nottingham, and a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Oxford. He is a leading expert on the life and works of Claudio Monteverdi, and is the author of the books "Duet and Dialogue in the Age of Monteverdi" (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilms International, 1982) "Monteverdi, 'Orfeo' " (London: Cambridge University Press, 1986), "Monteverdi, Vespers (1610)" (Cambridge University Press, 1997), and "The Cambridge Companion to Monteverdi" (with Richard Wistreich, Cambridge University Press, 2007). For five years he was co-editor of the journal "Music & Letters". He currently serves on the board of the Birmingham Early Music Festival and is head of the music history department at the University of Birmingham. Carmen Jones is a 1943 Broadway musical with music by Georges Bizet (orchestrated for Broadway by Robert Russell Bennett) and lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II which was performed at The Broadway Theatre. Conceptually, it is Bizet's opera "Carmen" updated to a World War II-era African-American setting. (Bizet's opera was, in turn, based on the 1846 novella by Prosper Mérimée.) The Broadway musical was produced by Billy Rose, using an all-black cast, and directed by Hassard Short. Robert Shaw prepared the choral portions of the show. Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi (] ; 15 May 1567 (baptized) – 29 November 1643) was an Italian composer, string player and choirmaster. A composer of both secular and sacred music, and a pioneer in the development of opera, he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the Renaissance and the Baroque periods of music history. The Symphony in C is an early work by the French composer Georges Bizet. According to "Grove's Dictionary", the symphony "reveals an extraordinarily accomplished talent for a 17-year-old student, in melodic invention, thematic handling and orchestration." Bizet started work on the symphony in C major on 29 October 1855, four days after turning 17, and finished it roughly a month later. It was written while he was studying at the Paris Conservatoire under the composer Charles Gounod, and was evidently a student assignment. Bizet showed no apparent interest in having it performed or published, and the piece was never played in his lifetime. He used certain material from the symphony in later works, however. There is no mention of the work in Bizet's letters, and it was unknown to his earlier biographers. His widow, Geneviève Halévy (1849–1926), gave the manuscript to Reynaldo Hahn, who left it along with other papers to the archives of the conservatory library, where it was found in 1933 by Jean Chantavoine. Soon thereafter, Bizet's first British biographer Douglas Charles Parker (1885–1970) showed the manuscript to the conductor Felix Weingartner, who led the first performance in Basel, Switzerland, on 26 February 1935. Carmen Suite is a one-act ballet created in 1967 by Cuban choreographer Alberto Alonso to music by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin for his wife, prima ballerina assoluta Maya Plisetskaya. The premiere took place on 20 April 1967 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. The music, taken from the opera "Carmen" by Georges Bizet and arranged for strings and percussion, is not a 19th-century pastiche but rather "a creative meeting of the minds," as Shchedrin put it, with Bizet's melodies reclothed in a variety of fresh instrumental colors (including the frequent use of percussion), set to new rhythms and often phrased with a great deal of sly wit. Initially banned by the Soviet hierarchy as "disrespectful" to the opera for precisely these qualities, the ballet has since become Shchedrin's best-known work and has remained popular in the West for what reviewer James Sanderson calls "an iconoclastic but highly entertaining retelling of Bizet's opera." The Symphony in C "Roma" is the second of Georges Bizet's symphonies. Unlike his first symphony, also in C major, which was written quickly at the age of 17, "Roma" was written over an eleven-year span, between the ages of 22 and 33 (he died at age 36). Bizet was never fully satisfied with it, subjecting it to a number of revisions, but died before finishing his definitive version. All four movements were performed in his lifetime, but never all on the same occasion. The full symphony in its latest revision was premiered in 1875, after his death. It is perhaps because of Bizet's dissatisfaction that the work is often said to be "unfinished". However, in the form in which it exists today, it is a complete work and is fully scored. It has been recorded a number of times but is not often heard on the concert platform. Georges Bizet composed L'Arlésienne as incidental music to Alphonse Daudet's play of the same name, usually translated as "The Girl from Arles". It was first performed on 1 October 1872 at the Vaudeville Theatre (now a cinema known as the Gaumont Opéra). Bizet's music consists of 27 numbers (some only a few bars) for voice, chorus, and small orchestra, ranging from short solos to longer entr'actes. Bizet himself played the harmonium backstage at the premiere performance. Georges Bizet (] ; 25 October 18383 June 1875), registered at birth as Alexandre César Léopold Bizet, was a French composer of the romantic era. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, "Carmen", which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire.

**Question:** Who was the American congressman whose actions led to a CIA program to arm Jihadi warriors in Afghanistan in the 1980's?
**Answer:** Charlie Wilson

**Context:**
Joseph John Gurney (2 August 1788 – 4 January 1847) was a banker in Norwich, England and a member of the Gurney family of that city. He became an evangelical minister of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), whose views and actions led, ultimately, to a schism among American Quakers. Charlie Wilson's War is a 2007 American comedy-drama film, based on the story of U.S. Congressman Charlie Wilson and CIA operative Gust Avrakotos, whose efforts led to Operation Cyclone, a program to organize and support the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War. Qari Saifullah Akhtar (Urdu: قاری سیف اللہ اختر‎ ; died 9 January 2017) was an alleged member of Al-Qaeda who was in Pakistani custody few times prior to his death. Akhtar, a graduate of Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia in Karachi, had been the leader of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI), a jihadi organization. He is a key figure and founder of HUJI and has involved in jihadi groups since the early 1980s. He was appointed the head of HUJI following the killing of Mawlana Irshad Ahmed at Sharana during clashes with Soviet forces in June 1985. He was reportedly involved in the 1995 coup attempt to topple the Pakistani government led by Benazir Bhutto. When HUJI merged with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HUM) around 1990 to form Harkat-ul-Ansar (HUA), Akhtar acted as deputy to former HUM leader and then amir Maulana Fazalur Rehman Khalil. HUA dissolved back into two separate groups in 1997, allowing Akhtar to become amir of HUJI. Since 1998 when Osama bin Laden released a fatwa under the banner World Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders, segments of HUJI have joined al-Qaeda. It has been reported that Akhtar was running a training camp at Rishkhor, Afghanistan before the US invaded Afghanistan in 2001, and had trained 3,500 persons in conventional and unconventional combat. He disappeared from Afghanistan but was apprehended in August 2004 in the United Arab Emirates. He was then handed over to Pakistan. Operation Cyclone was the code name for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) program to arm and finance the Jihadi warriors, "mujahideen", in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, prior to and during the military intervention by the USSR in support of its client, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The program leaned heavily towards supporting militant Islamic groups that were favored by the regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in neighboring Pakistan, rather than other, less ideological Afghan resistance groups that had also been fighting the Marxist-oriented Democratic Republic of Afghanistan regime since before the Soviet intervention. Operation Cyclone was one of the longest and most expensive covert CIA operations ever undertaken; funding began with $20–$30 million per year in 1980 and rose to $630 million per year in 1987. Funding continued after 1989 as the mujahideen battled the forces of Mohammad Najibullah's PDPA during the civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992). Maria Darlene Pearson or Hai-Mecha Eunka (lit. "Running Moccasins") (July 12, 1932 – May 23, 2003) was a Yankton Dakota activist who successfully challenged the legal treatment of Native American human remains. She was one of the primary catalysts for the creation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Her actions led to her being called "the Founding Mother of the modern Indian repatriation movement" and "the Rosa Parks of NAGPRA". Ebenezer Erskine (22 June 1680 – 2 June 1754) was a Scottish minister whose actions led to the establishment of the Secession Church (formed by dissenters from the Church of Scotland). The Chicago Cardinals were a professional ice hockey team playing in the American Hockey Association. The team only played one season in the league. It was notable because it was founded by Eddie Livingstone, a Toronto businessman, who had owned an ice hockey team in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and whose actions led the owners of the NHA to disband the league and form the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917. The Cardinals were formed by Livingstone in an attempt to bring about a rival league to the NHL. Because of the Cardinals, the NHL attacked the AHA and attempted to steal its players. The Cardinals would fold under the pressure placed on the league and the team. Livingstone would attempt to recoup his losses by selling the team, but this was denied. He later tried to sue for damages. John Albaugh is the former Chief of Staff to Congressman Ernest Istook and was a cooperating witness in the Department of Justice investigation of Kevin Ring, a lobbyist and an associate of Jack Abramoff. In June 2008 Albaugh pleaded guilty to conspiracy with Kevin Ring. As part of his plea agreement Albaugh wore a wire during a conversation with former Congressman Istook, testified for three days during trial, and provided other assistance to the government. However, Albaugh’s plea agreement fell apart when he informed the government that his actions were motivated by campaign contributions provided by Kevin Ring to Congressman Istook, and not by tickets to sporting events or meals provided by Ring to Albaugh. As a result of breaking his plea agreement the government requested Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle to sentence Albaugh to 27 months in prison. Judge Huvelle, however, rejected that request and instead sentenced Albaugh to four months in a half-way house citing his cooperation with the government investigation and saying “There are three or four Congressman out there that will never see the light of day for their actions, and we’re blaming the staffers,”. Huvelle declined to fine Albaugh or require him to perform community service because of his work with a non-profit organization which operates schools and medical clinics in Afghanistan saying that it was unnecessary. According to the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counter-Terrorism. As the power balance shifted towards this alliance, the CIA program backfired and the militias of the Islamic Court Union (ICU) gained control of the country. The history of Omaha, Nebraska began before the settlement of the city, with speculators from neighboring Council Bluffs, Iowa staking land across the Missouri River illegally as early as the 1840s. Before it was legal to claim land in Indian Country, William D. Brown was operating the Lone Tree Ferry to bring settlers from Council Bluffs to Omaha. A treaty with the Omaha Tribe allowed the creation of the Nebraska Territory, and Omaha City was founded on July 4, 1854. With early settlement came claim jumpers and squatters, and the formation of a vigilante law group called the Omaha Claim Club, which was one of many claim clubs across the Midwest. During this period many of the city's founding fathers received lots in Scriptown, which was made possible by the actions of the Omaha Claim Club. The club's violent actions led to the U.S. Supreme Court trial, "Baker v. Morton", which led to the end of the organization.

On a cloudless day, one can clearly see Martinique. The Fort remains in pristine condition at Pigeon Island and still has many cannons positioned, as if ready for battle. Emma Cline is an American writer and novelist, originally from California. She published her first novel, "The Girls", in 2016, to positive reviews. The book was shortlisted for the John Leonard Award from the National Book Critics Circle and the Center for Fiction's First Novel Prize. Her stories have been published in "The New Yorker", "Tin House", "Granta" and "The Paris Review". In 2017 Cline was named one of "Granta's" Best Young American Novelists. Cline served as Executive Vice President for the league. In May 2001, Cline was named as the first winner of the National Lacrosse League Executive of the Year Award. In June 2005, it was announced that Cline will be inducted into the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame along with Chris Fritz, Paul Gait, Gary Gait and Les Bartley. It was made official at the 2006 NLL All-Star Game in Toronto. Oliver Monroe "Ollie" Cline (December 31, 1925 – May 12, 2001) was a college and professional American football fullback who played for the Ohio State Buckeyes, Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions in the 1940s and 1950s. A standout high school athlete in his hometown of Fredericktown, Ohio, Cline attended Ohio State University starting in 1944. He became the football team's primary fullback that year as the school went unbeaten and was ranked second in the nation in the AP Poll. The following year, Cline was named the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference, rushing for 936 yards as Ohio State built up a 7–2 record and was ranked 12th in the AP Poll. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Army at the end of World War II, Cline returned to Ohio State for a final season in 1947. Rodney Cline Carew (born October 1, 1945) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman, second baseman and coach of Panamanian descent. He played from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins and the California Angels and was elected to the All-Star game every season except his last. While Carew was never a home run threat (only 92 of his 3,053 hits were home runs), he made a career out of being a consistent contact hitter. He threw right-handed and batted left-handed. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. Carew served as an MLB coach for several years after retiring as a player. Carew Tower is a 49-story, 574 ft Art Deco building completed in 1930 in the heart of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, overlooking the Ohio River waterfront. The structure is the second-tallest building in the city, and it was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks on April 19, 1994. The tower is named after Joseph T.

The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers (1938- 1966) were an early bluegrass band which included such notable "first generation" bluegrass musicians as Ezra Cline, Bobby Osborne, Paul Williams, Melvin Goins, Charlie Cline, Curly Ray Cline, Larry Richardson and for a short time Jimmy Martin. The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named "Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers". The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia. During World War II, Ned was killed in action. When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis. Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca. It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass. This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none. Finally, on October 1, 2009, The Lonesome Pine Fiddlers got their due when they were inducted into the International Bluegrass Hall of Fame at the Ryman Theater (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry). Bobby Osborne, Melvin Goins and Paul Williams were there to receive the bands award. In the crowd of a sold out theater was the son of Ezra Cline, Scotty Ireland Cline, who recalled being in that same theater as a child sitting on stage and watching the Fiddlers play. (At the time, the Opry had bleachers for family just off stage). The final act of the evening at the IBMA Awards was the playing of "Pain in my Heart" by Osborne, Goins and Williams along with a Song from the Dillards, who were also inducted the same evening. 1982 Cline, provisional designation 1975 VA, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 4 November 1975, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at Palomar Observatory in California, and named after Edwin Lee Cline, inventor and friend of the discoverer.

**Question:** What type of conflict does Nathaniel Starbuck and Bernard Cornwell have in common?
**Answer:** War

**Context:**
Nathaniel Starbuck is a fictional character, Confederate soldier, and the protagonist of British author Bernard Cornwell's (b. 1944), ""Starbuck Chronicles"" series of novels of historical fiction. Cornwell is also author of several other series of historical fiction such as the "Richard Sharpe" novels of the British campaigns in the Peninsular War in Spain during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th Century. Faulconer County is a fictional county in the state of Virginia, a setting in the Starbuck Chronicles by Bernard Cornwell set during the American Civil War. Bernard Cornwell, OBE (born 23 February 1944) is an English author of historical novels and a history of the Waterloo Campaign. He is best known for his novels about Napoleonic Wars rifleman Richard Sharpe. Cornwell has written historical novels primarily of English history in five series and one series of contemporary thriller novels. A feature of his historical novels is an end note on how the novel matches or differs from history, for the re-telling, and what one might see at the modern site of the battles described in the novel. One series of historical novels is set in the American Civil War. He wrote a nonfiction book on the battle of Waterloo, in addition to the fictional story of the famous battle in the Sharpe Series. Two of the historical novel series have been adapted for television; the Sharpe television series by ITV and "The Last Kingdom" by BBC. He lives in the US with his wife. He alternates between Cape Cod, Massachusetts and Charleston, South Carolina. The Starbuck Chronicles are a series of historical fiction novels by British author Bernard Cornwell set during the American Civil War. They follow the exploits of a young Boston-born Confederate officer, Nathaniel Starbuck. Sharpe's Peril is a British TV film from 2008, usually shown in two parts, which is part of an ITV series based on Bernard Cornwell's historical fiction novels about the English soldier Richard Sharpe during the Napoleonic Wars. Contrary to most parts of the TV series, "Sharpe's Peril" isn't based on one of Cornwell's novels. Both are set in 1817, two years after Sharpe has retired as a farmer in Normandy, so chronologically they come after "Sharpe's Waterloo" (1815) and before the final novel "Sharpe's Devil" (1820–21). In "Sharpe's Challenge" and "Sharpe's Peril", Sharpe and his comrade in arms, Patrick Harper, have been temporarily called out of retirement and asked to go to India. The Fort is a historical novel written by Bernard Cornwell. The book relates to the events of the Penobscot Expedition of 1779 during the American Revolutionary War. While centred on the efforts of a regiment of Scots to establish and hold the fort against superior numbers of American revolutionaries, it contrasts the actions of two military icons: John Moore (later Sir John), a young officer who later laid the foundations of the light infantry doctrine used by the 95th Rifles and others against the French in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars; and Paul Revere, hero of Longfellow's poem written two generations later but, according to Cornwell's research, an insubordinate, unreliable and probably dishonest character who was a major factor in the defeat of the Americans. Sharpe's Christmas contains two short stories, "Sharpe's Christmas" and "Sharpe's Ransom", written by historical fiction author Bernard Cornwell. They feature Cornwell's fictional hero Richard Sharpe. Originally, the first short-story, "Sharpe's Christmas", was written for British newspaper "The Daily Mail" which serialised it during the Christmas season of 1995. Later, in an effort to raise funds for The Bernard and Judy Cornwell Foundation, an extended version was published by The Sharpe Appreciation Society in 2003 to add "Sharpe's Ransom" into a collection of the two short stories simply titled Sharpe's Christmas. Sharpe's Christmas, is a short story collection by historical fiction author Bernard Cornwell which he began conceptualising in 1980s. It contains two stories featuring Cornwell's fictional hero Richard Sharpe. It was published by The Sharpe Appreciation Society in 2003 in order to raise funds for The Bernard and Judy Cornwell Foundation. This novel contains two stories that take place at different times, thus in an interview with the author, the book was left unnumbered in the Sharpe’s series. Sharpe's Christmas, is a short story by historical fiction author Bernard Cornwell. It features Cornwell's fictional hero Richard Sharpe. It was originally written for British newspaper "The Daily Mail" which serialised it during the Christmas season of 1994. An extended version was published by The Sharpe Appreciation Society in a short story collection of the same name in 2003 to raise funds for The Bernard and Judy Cornwell Foundation. Sharpe's Challenge is a British TV film from 2006, usually shown in two parts, which is part of an ITV series based on Bernard Cornwell's historical fiction novels about the English soldier Richard Sharpe during the Napoleonic Wars. Contrary to most parts of the TV series, "Sharpe's Challenge", as well as the follow-up "Sharpe's Peril", isn't based entirely on one of Cornwell's novels, but it uses and adapts some characters and storylines from "Sharpe's Tiger". Both are set in 1817, two years after Sharpe has retired as a farmer in Normandy, so chronologically they come after "Sharpe's Waterloo" (1815) and before the final novel "Sharpe's Devil" (1820–21). Some of the events in the film are, however, inspired by events in the first three novels of the series. In "Sharpe's Challenge" and "Sharpe's Peril", Sharpe and his comrade in arms, Patrick Harper, have been temporarily called out of retirement and asked to go to India.

Produced by Swift alongside Nathan Chapman, the song was sent to mainstream radio in the United States on April 19, 2011, as the fourth single from "Speak Now". Swift composed "The Story of Us" regarding the time when she encountered an ex-boyfriend of hers at the 2010 CMT Music Awards. At the event, the two attempted to ignore each other, which inspired Swift to compose the song. "Mean" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift for her third studio album, "Speak Now" (2010). Produced by Swift alongside Nathan Chapman, the song was sent to country radio in the United States on March 13, 2011, as the third single from "Speak Now".

The song also appeared on the Australian Singles Chart at number 45. "Teardrops on My Guitar" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift, alongside Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut album (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, "Fearless" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of "Rolling Stone") citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of "PopMatters") indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements. "Our Song" is a country song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman. It was released on September 9, 2007 by Big Machine Records as the third single from Swift's eponymous debut album, "Taylor Swift" (2006). Swift solely composed "Our Song" for the talent show of her freshman year in high school, about a boyfriend who she did not have a song with.

"Fifteen" was released on August 30, 2009 by Big Machine Records, as the fourth single from Swift's second studio album, "Fearless" (2008). The song was inspired by Swift's freshman year of high school at Hendersonville High School, where she first encountered heartbreak, along with her best friend Abigail Anderson. After writing it, Swift asked Anderson for authorization to record the song (due to personal references in the song); Anderson affirmed and it was ultimately included on "Fearless". "Fifteen" is a ballad, which has Swift reminiscing on events that occurred to her and her best friend at the age of 15 and cautioning teenagers to not fall in love easily.

It focused on the moment where Swift accepted that the relationship was over. "White Horse" is, musically, a country song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals. Lyrically, the track speaks of disillusionment and pain in a relationship, drawing references to fairytales. "Fearless" is a country pop song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The song was co-written by Swift in collaboration with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman and Swift. "Fearless" was released on January 3, 2010 by Big Machine Records as the fifth and final single from Swift's second studio album of the same name (2008). Swift composed the song while traveling on tour to promote her eponymous debut album, "Taylor Swift" (2006). She wrote "Fearless" in regard to the fearlessness of falling in love and eventually titled her second studio album after the song. Musically, it contains qualities commonly found in country pop music and, lyrically, is about a perfect first date. Fearless is the second studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The album was released on November 11, 2008, by Big Machine Records. As with her first album, "Taylor Swift", Swift wrote or co-wrote all thirteen tracks on "Fearless". Most of the songs were written as the singer promoted her first album as the opening act for numerous country artists. Due to the unavailability of collaborators on the road, eight songs were written by Swift. Other songs were co-written with Liz Rose, Hillary Lindsey, Colbie Caillat, and John Rich. Swift also made her debut as a record producer, co-producing all songs on the album with Nathan Chapman. "Change" is a song performed by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Swift self-penned the song and co-produced it alongside Nathan Chapman. The song was released on August 8, 2008, with all proceeds being donated to the United States Olympic team.

The track was later chosen as one of the themes for the 2008 Summer Olympics and was included on the "AT&T Team USA Soundtrack", which was released August 7, 2008.

The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman, alongside Swift. It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album "Fearless" (2008). The song was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced "Romeo and Juliet"' s original tragic conclusion with a happy ending. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet.

Clayton was born on September 12, 1955, at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Benning, Georgia. Clayton was the oldest of six children, having one brother and four sisters, and was named after his father, Clayton Raleigh Fountain. The family moved every 1½ to 2 years. While his father served combat tours in Korea and Vietnam and his mother was working, Clayton, as the oldest child in family, became a surrogate for both parents when he was very young. He recalled maternal responsibilities for cooking, ironing, serving, cleaning, and caring for his young siblings. It was the male/paternal role, however, for which his father had carefully trained him. While serving in the Marines, he was convicted of murdering his staff sergeant in 1974, while stationed in the Philippines. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was ultimately sent to the United States Penitentiary, Marion, which was at the time the highest-security prison in the nation. Fountain used his military training to murder three prisoners and one correctional officer with a homemade knife while serving time at Marion, and was labeled the "Most Dangerous Prisoner" in the federal system. The Clear Creek Meeting House is a Friends meeting house located at 14365 N. 350th Ave., southeast of McNabb, in Magnolia Township, Putnam County, Illinois. The meeting house was built in 1875 to house the Illinois Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers. The Yearly Meeting was the westernmost annual meeting of the Hicksite Friends and attracted followers from several states. The meeting house also hosted the Clear Creek Monthly Meeting, which was attended by local Quakers. The building is typical of American Friends meeting houses; it features two square rooms with plain features both outside and inside. The lack of ornamentation was designed to reflect the Quaker tenet of simplicity. The meeting house is one of the few surviving western Quaker meeting houses which represent this tradition of Quaker architecture. John Ingram McMorran (June 19, 1889 – February 24, 2003) was an American supercentenarian and was one of the recognized oldest people in the world, living to the age of 113 years, 250 days. He was born in Goodland Township, Michigan, the oldest child of George McMorran (born October 15, 1859) and Lydia Ingram. Ingram McMorran was the cousin of Representative Henry Gordon McMorran (1844–1929). His sister, Lillia Elizabeth Webb née McMorran, lived to the age of 103. In his youth, a fortuneteller predicted McMorran would live to age 111, but this seemingly outlandish forecast proved conservative, as barely one in six people who reach 111 live as long as McMorran finally did. At the time of his death in 2003, his grandson, Bob McMorran, was a grandfather himself, to the then five-year-old Logan Saxton. McMorran smoked, drank, and ate greasy food. Zeresenay (Zeray) Alemseged (born 4 June 1969) is an Ethiopian paleoanthropologist and was Chair of the Anthropology Department at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, United States. He recently joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. He is best known for his discovery, on December 10, 2000, of Selam, also referred to as “Lucy’s child”, the almost-complete fossilized remains of a 3.3 million year old child of the species "Australopithecus afarensis". The “world’s oldest child”, she is the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor discovered to date. Selam represents a milestone in our understanding of human and pre-human evolution and contributes significantly to our understanding of the biology and childhood of early species in the human lineage; a subject about which we have very little information. Alemseged discovered Selam while working with the Dikika Research Project (DRP), a multi-national research project, which he both initiated in 1999 and leads. The DRP has thus far made many important paleoanthropological discoveries and returns to the field each year to conduct further important research. Alemseged’s specific research centers on the discovery and interpretation of hominin fossil remains and their environments, with emphasis on fieldwork designed to acquire new data on early hominin skeletal biology, environmental context, and behavior. On June 9, 2016, a meeting was held in Trump Tower in New York City between three senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald TrumpDonald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafortand at least five other people, including Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting was arranged by publicist and long-time Trump acquantiance, Rob Goldstone on behalf of his client, singer-songwriter Emin Agalarov. It was disclosed to U.S. government officials when Kushner filed a revised version of his security clearance form. Donald John Trump Jr. (born December 31, 1977) is an American businessman and former reality TV personality. He is the oldest child of the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, and his first wife, Ivana.

**Question:** Ghostkeeper's plot is inspired by a legend that lends its name to what type of medical condition?
**Answer:** psychosis

**Context:**
Therapeutic inertia (also known as clinical inertia) is a measurement of the resistance to therapeutic treatment for an existing medical condition. It is commonly measured as a percentage of the number of encounters in which a patient with a condition received new or increased therapeutic treatment out of the total number of visits to a health care professional by the patient. A high percentage indicates that the health care provider is slow to treat a medical condition. A low percentage indicates that a provider is extremely quick in prescribing new treatment at the onset of any medical condition. Sinoatrial arrest (also known as sinus arrest or sinus pause) is a medical condition wherein the sinoatrial node of the heart transiently ceases to generate the electrical impulses that normally stimulate the myocardial tissues to contract and thus the heart to beat. It is defined as lasting from 2.0 seconds to several minutes. Since the heart contains multiple pacemakers, this interruption of the cardiac cycle generally lasts only a few seconds before another part of the heart, such as the atrio-ventricular junction or the ventricles, begins pacing and restores the heart action. This condition can be detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG) as a brief period of irregular length with no electrical activity before either the sinoatrial node resumes normal pacing, or another pacemaker begins pacing. If a pacemaker other than the sinoatrial node is pacing the heart, this condition is known as an escape rhythm. If no other pacemaker begins pacing during an episode of sinus arrest it becomes a cardiac arrest. This condition is sometimes confused with sinoatrial block, a condition in which the pacing impulse is generated, but fails to conduct through the myocardium. Differential diagnosis of the two conditions is possible by examining the exact length of the interruption of cardiac activity. The Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative, also known as Amendment 2, was approved by voters in the Tuesday, November 8, 2016, general election in the State of Florida. The bill required a super-majority vote to pass, with at least 60% of voters voting for support of a state constitutional amendment. Florida already had a medical marijuana law in place, but only for those who are terminally ill and with less than a year left to live. The goal of Amendment 2 is to alleviate those suffering from these medical conditions: cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Crohn's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic nonmalignant pain caused by a qualifying medical condition or that originates from a qualified medical condition or other debilitating medical conditions comparable to those listed. Under Amendment 2, the medical marijuana will be given to the patient if the physician believes that the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient but smoking the medication is not allowed, instead the product can be consumed as edibles or by using vaping, oils, sprays or pills. Ghostkeeper is a 1981 Canadian independent horror film directed by Jim Makichuk. The story centers on a trio of snowmobilers in the Canadian Rockies who become stranded at an abandoned hotel, where an old woman is hiding an evil entity within the basement. The film's plot is inspired by the Windigo legend of North America. The legend lends its name to the controversial modern medical term Wendigo psychosis, described by psychiatrists as a culture-bound syndrome with symptoms such as an intense craving for human flesh and a fear of becoming a cannibal. In some Indigenous communities, environmental destruction and insatiable greed are also seen as a manifestation of Wendigo Psychosis. A cure is the end of a medical condition; the substance or procedure that ends the medical condition, such as a medication, a surgical operation, a change in lifestyle, or even a philosophical mindset that helps end a person's sufferings; or the state of being healed, or cured. Adenomyosis is a gynecologic medical condition characterized by the abnormal presence of endometrial tissue (the inner lining of the uterus) within the myometrium (the thick, muscular layer of the uterus). In contrast, when endometrial tissue is present entirely outside the uterus, it represents a similar but distinct medical condition called endometriosis. The two conditions are found together in many cases, but often occur independently. Before being recognized as its own condition, adenomyosis used to be called "endometriosis interna". Additionally, the less-commonly used term "adenomyometritis" is a more specific name for the condition, specifying involvement of the uterus. In medicine, a natural history study is a study that follows a group of people over time who have, or are at risk of developing, a specific medical condition or disease. A natural history study collects health information over time in order to understand how the medical condition or disease develops and to give insight into how it might be treated. Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) occurs when an injured employee reaches a state where his or her condition cannot be improved any further or when a treatment plateau in a person’s healing process is reached. It can mean that the patient has fully recovered from the injury or that the patient’s medical condition has stabilized to the point that no major medical or emotional change can be expected in the injured workers’ condition. At that point, no further healing or improvement is deemed possible and this occurs despite continuing medical treatment or rehabilitative programs the injured worker partakes in. When a worker who is receiving Workers' Compensation benefits reaches maximum medical improvement, his or her condition is assessed and a degree of permanent or partial impairment is determined. This degree will impact the amount of benefits the worker is able to receive. Chilblains ( ) — also known as pernio, Chill Burns and perniosis — is a medical condition that occurs when a predisposed individual is exposed to cold and humidity, causing tissue damage. It is often confused with frostbite and trench foot. Damage to capillary beds in the skin causes redness, itching, inflammation, and sometimes blisters. Chilblains can be reduced by keeping the feet and hands warm in cold weather, and avoiding extreme temperature changes. Chilblains can be idiopathic (spontaneous and unrelated to another disease), but may also be a manifestation of another serious medical condition that must be investigated. A history of chilblains suggests a connective tissue disease (such as lupus). In infants, chilblains together with severe neurologic disease and unexplained fevers occurs in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, a rare inherited condition.

**Question:** The Church of the Guanche People was founded in the city that is on the most populated island of what larger area?
**Answer:** Macaronesia

**Context:**
Mactan or Maktan is a densely populated island located a few kilometres (~1 mile) from Cebu Island in the Philippines. The island is part of Cebu Province and it is divided into Lapu-Lapu City and the municipality of Cordova. The island is separated from Cebu by the Mactan Channel which is crossed by two bridges: the Marcelo Fernan Bridge and the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge. The island covers some 65 km2 and is home to some 470,000 people, making it the nation's most densely populated island. Along with Olango Island Group, the isles are administered as 1 city and a municipality covering 75.25 km2 . Bjørnøya (English: Bear Island ) is a populated island in Haram Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is connected to the Norwegian mainland through a man-made causeway. The nearest larger village on the mainland is Søvik. To the east of the Bjørnøya (between Bjørnøya and Søvik) lies the island of Terøya. The two islands are separated by the Bjørnøysundet. The island was part of the former municipality of Borgund until 1965 when it joined Haram. Loppa Church (Norwegian: "Loppa kirke" ) is a parish church in the municipality of Loppa in Finnmark county, Norway. It is located in the village of Loppa on the sparsely populated island of Loppa. The church is part of the Loppa parish in the Alta deanery in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. The small white wooden church was built in 1953. The church seats about 150 people, but it is rarely used since the island has few residents. Tenerife ( ; ] ) is the largest and most populated island of the seven Canary Islands. It is also the most populated island of Spain, with a land area of 2034.38 km2 and 898,680 inhabitants, 43 percent of the total population of the Canary Islands. Tenerife is the largest and most populous island of Macaronesia. The island of Vilsandi, Kihelkonna Parish, Saare County, Estonia is located in the Baltic Sea. It covers an area of some 9 square km and is the westernmost populated island in Estonia. The surrounding waters are shallow and rocky and many ships travelling the Baltic have perished nearby. The island of Vilsandi can be reached by boat, by truck having suitable clearance or on foot by wading from Saaremaa. Much of the island is now part of Vilsandi National Park, which grew from a bird reserve founded in 1910. It is a highly sensitive ecosystem due to the use of the area by many migratory birds as a breeding and nesting ground. Hunting is absolutely prohibited. This park is a popular tourist destination not only for local Estonians, but also people of Finland who are visiting Estonia in greater and greater numbers. Pung Island (Korean: 풍도 , Pungdo) is a small populated island on the Yellow Sea, located in within the municipal borders of Ansan city, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, about 74 km South West of Seoul, the country's capital town, and 24 km south of the larger Daebudo island. Guanche mummies are the intentionally desiccated remains of members of the indigenous Guanche people of the Canary Islands. The majority of Guanche mummies were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century. The methods of embalming are similar to those that were used by the Ancient Egyptians, though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to looting and desecration. The Church of the Guanche People (Spanish: "Iglesia del Pueblo Guanche" ) is a religious organisation, founded in 2001 in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna (Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain). It aims to perpetuate and spread the pagan religion of the ancient Guanche people. Karlsøy Church (Norwegian: "Karlsøy kirke" ) is a historic parish church in the municipality of Karlsøy in Troms county, Norway. It is located on the island of Karlsøya. The church is part of the Karlsøy parish in the Tromsø arch-deanery in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. The white wooden church was built in 1854 and it seats about 570 people. The church is no longer in regular use, since it is on a remote, now-sparsely populated island. The church holds special services occasionally including one summer service each year. Wheeling Island is the most populated island in the Ohio River. It lies within the city of Wheeling in Ohio County, West Virginia, in the United States. The 2000 census showed a resident population of 3,142 people on the island, which has a land area of 1.514 km² (374 acres). Neville Island, PA is larger (3.4 km²) but has fewer people (1,232).

**Question:** The Grieg crater is named for a Norwegian composer who composed during what era?
**Answer:** Romantic

**Context:**
Mount Grieg is a snow-covered mountain, rising to about 800 m , with a rock-exposed west face, overlooking the southeast part of Brahms Inlet and is situated on the base of the Derocher Peninsula, on the north side of the Beethoven Peninsula in the southwest part of Alexander Island, Antarctica. A number of mountains in this vicinity first appear on maps by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition (RARE), 1947–48. This mountain, apparently one of these, was mapped from RARE air photos by D. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960, and was remapped by the United States Geological Survey, 1988. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Edvard Grieg, the Norwegian composer. Edvard Hagerup Grieg (] ; 15 June 18434 September 1907) was a Norwegian composer and pianist. He is widely considered one of the leading Romantic era composers, and his music is part of the standard classical repertoire worldwide. His use and development of Norwegian folk music in his own compositions put the music of Norway in the international spectrum, as well as helping to develop a national identity, much as Jean Sibelius and Antonín Dvořák did in Finland and Bohemia, respectively. Grieg usually refers to the Norwegian composer and pianist Edvard Grieg. It may also refer to: The Edvard Prize is a Norwegian music award in given by TONO, copyright organization for musicians and composers. The award, which was first awarded in 1998, is awarded annually and can only be awarded to members of the organization. The goal is to enhance the musical life and increase awareness of Norwegian composers and writers and their works. The prize is named after the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg. Edvard Grieg – mennesket og kunstneren ("Edvard Grieg. The Man and the Artist") is a biography of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, written by Finn Benestad and Dag Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1980. Edvard Grieg composed his Funeral March in Memory of Rikard Nordraak in 1866, in honour of his friend and fellow Norwegian composer Rikard Nordraak, who had died in March of that year at the age of 23. Grieg deeply respected his fellow musician and took no delay in producing the work. The march was originally written as a piano piece in A minor; Grieg also produced transcriptions of it for brass choir and wind band, in B♭ minor. Grieg is a crater on Mercury. It has a diameter of 65 kilometers. Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1985. Grieg is named for the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, who lived from 1843 to 1907. Edvard Grieg is a bronze sculpture depicting the Norwegian composer and pianist of the same name by Finn Frolich, installed in Grieg Garden on the University of Washington campus in Seattle's University District, in the U.S. state of Washington. The Grieg Academy (Norwegian: "Griegakademiet" ) has historically served as an umbrella term referring to higher education music programs in Bergen, the birthplace of composer Edvard Grieg, as well as various collaborations across music institutions in Bergen, Norway. However, as of mid-2016, due to mergers between several Norwegian institutions, the structure of Grieg Academy is changing and its remaining components are expected to be a doctoral research school (Grieg Research School in Interdisicplinary Music Studies) and various research groups. Specifically, this is due to a merger between the University of Bergen’s Faculty of Humanities with the Bergen Academy of Art and Design, as well as a nearly simultaneous merger between Bergen University College and two other university colleges in western Norway: Stord/Haugesund University College and Sogn og Fjordane University College to become, in January 2017, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HvL) The music programs across HvL will be the largest music department in western Norway in terms of the number of full time teachers. Troldhaugen is the former home of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg and his wife Nina Grieg. Troldhaugen is located in Bergen, Norway and consists of the Edvard Grieg Museum, Grieg’s villa, the hut where he composed music, and his and his wife's gravesite.

When he retired from the presidency of Lucky Stores in 1947 there were thirty-three stores in the chain with an annual gross of $30,000,000. At the openings of his various stores Crouch used such devices as simulated carnivals, also hiring popular jazz bands to attract customers. He engaged Raymond Loewy Associates of New York City to design what was considered to be a new type of supermarket, employing color psychology to attract customers and providing each customer with a lightweight aluminum shopping cart on which was mounted a printed directory to all merchandise in the store. In 1949 Crouch was named man of the year in the merchandising field by Operations, Inc., a national research and sales organization serving large chain stores, manufacturers, and wholesale grocers.

**Answer:** Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower

**Context:**
The Supreme Life Building is a historic insurance building located at 3501 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier. The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States. Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community. The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s. The Metropolitan Life North Building, now known as Eleven Madison, is a 30-story art deco skyscraper on Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City, at 11-25 Madison Avenue. The building is bordered by East 24th Street, Madison Avenue, East 25th Street and Park Avenue South, and is connected by an elevated walkway to the Met Life Tower just south of it. The North Building was built on the site of Richard Upjohn's original Madison Square Presbyterian Church. The second church, designed by Stanford White of McKim, Mead and White was built in 1906, across 24th street on land conveyed by Metropolitan Life. As part of the Metropolitan Life Home Office Complex, the North Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 19, 1996. 432 Park Avenue is a residential skyscraper in New York City that overlooks Central Park. Originally proposed to be 1300 ft in 2011, the structure topped out at 1396 ft . It was developed by CIM Group and features 104 condominium apartments. Construction began in 2012 and was completed on December 23, 2015. The Lyceum Theatre was a theatre in New York City located on Fourth Avenue, now Park Avenue South, between 23rd and 24th Streets in Manhattan. It was built in 1885 and operated until 1902, when it was torn down to make way for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower. It was replaced by a new Lyceum Theatre on 45th Street. For most of its existence, the theatre was home to Daniel Frohman’s Lyceum Theatre Stock Company, which presented many important plays and actors of the day. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, colloquially known as the Met Life Tower, is a landmark skyscraper located on Madison Avenue near the intersection with East 23rd Street, across from Madison Square Park in Manhattan, New York City.

The John Hancock Center is a 100-story, 1,128-foot (343.7 m) supertall skyscraper at 875 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, United States. It was constructed under the supervision of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with chief designer Bruce Graham and structural engineer Fazlur Khan. When the building topped out on May 6, 1968, it was the second tallest building in the world and the tallest outside of New York City. It is currently the fourth-tallest building in Chicago and the eighth-tallest in the United States, after One World Trade Center, the Willis Tower, 432 Park Avenue, the Trump Tower Chicago, the Empire State Building, the Bank of America Tower, and the Aon Center. When measured to the top of its antenna masts, it stands at 1500 ft . The building is home to offices and restaurants, as well as about 700 condominiums, and contains the third highest residence in the world, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the Trump Tower in Chicago. The building was named for John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, a developer and original tenant of the building. Physicians Mutual is a privately held insurance company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, that consists of Physicians Mutual Insurance Company and Physicians Life Insurance Company. Founded as Physicians Mutual Insurance Company in 1902 by Edwin E. Elliott, Physicians Mutual began by selling health insurance to medical professionals. Policies were offered to the general public starting in 1962, and by 1970 the company expanded into life insurance when it founded Physicians Life Insurance Company. Today the company offers a variety of insurance products, annuities, Medicare, Medigap, Medicare Supplement, Term Life Insurance, Whole Life Insurance, Cancer and funeral pre-planning services. It holds over US$3 billion in assets and employs over one thousand people. Robert A. Reed is chief executive officer and president. Some of the finest buildings in New Jersey, New York City, and other large eastern cities were built by the Hedden Construction Company, one of the largest construction companies operating in Newark in the very early 1900s. Among the most notable is the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower located at One Madison Avenue in New York, NY. The tower was the world's tallest building from 1909 to 1913 and home to the Hedden Construction Company's main offices located on the 36th and 37th floors. During this prosperous period over $40,000,000 in construction contracts and payments were collected by the firm. Protective Life Corporation is a financial service holding company in Birmingham, Alabama. The company’s primary subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company, was established in 1907 and now markets its products and services in all 50 states. As of December 31, 2016, the corporation had more than 2,700 employees, annual revenues of $4.48 billion and assets of $75 billion.

The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper. Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak. As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name "Flatiron" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.

The principal laws of association are contiguity, repetition, attention, pleasure-pain, and similarity. The basic laws were formulated by Aristotle in approximately 300 B.C. and by John Locke in the seventeenth century. Both philosophers taught that the mind at birth is a blank slate and that all knowledge has to be acquired by learning. The laws they taught still make up the backbone of modern learning theory. Voltaire in Love is a popular history of the sixteen-year relationship between Voltaire and the Émilie, the Marquise du Châtelet. Written by Nancy Mitford and first published in 1957, the book also explores the French Enlightenment. Jean du Chatelet, also known as Baron de Beausoleil and Auffembach (1578, Brabant – c. 1645, The Bastille, Paris), was a mineralogist, mining engineer and dowser. Disney's Twelve Basic Principles of Animation were introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book "". Johnston and Thomas in turn based their book on the work of the leading Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, and their effort to produce more realistic animations. The main purpose of the principles was to produce an illusion of characters adhering to the basic laws of physics, but they also dealt with more abstract issues, such as emotional timing and character appeal. The Basic Laws of Israel (Hebrew: חוקי היסוד‎ ‎ , "ħuqey ha-yesod") are the constitutional laws of the State of Israel. These laws deal with the formation and role of the principal institutions of the state, and with the relations between the state's authorities. They also protect civil rights, although some of these rights were earlier protected at common law by the Supreme Court of Israel. The Basic Laws are intended to be draft chapters of the future Israeli constitution, postponed since 1950, and act as a "de facto" constitution until their future incorporation into a formal, unitary, written constitution. Israel as of 2017 functions according to an uncodified constitution consisting of both material constitutional law, based upon cases and precedents, common law, and the provisions of these formal statutes. The Basic Laws do not cover all constitutional issues, and there is no deadline set for the completion of the process of merging them into one comprehensive constitution. There is no clear rule determining the precedence of Basic Rules over regular legislation, and in many cases this issue is left to interpretation by the judicial system. The State of Israel has an unwritten constitution. Instead of a formal written constitution, and in accordance with the Harari Decision (החלטת הררי) of 13 June 1950 adopted during the Israeli Constituent Assembly, the State of Israel has enacted several Basic Laws of Israel dealing with the government arrangements and with human rights. The Israeli Supreme Court President Aharon Barak ruled that the Basic Laws should be considered the state's constitution, and that became the common approach throughout his tenure (1995-2006). Opponents of this approach include Barak's colleague, Judge of the Supreme Court Mishael Cheshin. Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise Du Châtelet (] ; 17 December 1706  – 10 September 1749) was a French natural philosopher, mathematician, physicist, and author during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to childbirth in 1749. Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's book "Principia" containing basic laws of physics. The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation today. Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics—the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element. The Physics of Superheroes is a popular science book by physics professor and long-time comic-book fan James Kakalios. First published in 2005, it explores the basic laws of physics. Kakalios does not set out to show where the world of superheroes contradicts modern science, granting the heroes one or more "miracle exceptions" from natural law. Instead, he focuses on examples of comic book scenes that can be used to understand the diverse laws of physics from an unusual angle, such as Gwen Stacy's death and Ant-Man's ability to punch his way out of a paper bag. Kakalios relates these elements of comic books to principles of physics, such as levers and torque, and in this way covers diverse topics, from mechanics to the quantum world.

Professional Identification is a type of social identification and is the sense of oneness individuals have with a profession (e.g. law, medicine) and the degree to which individuals define themselves as profession members. Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. The Medical Council of Thailand is the country's professional regulatory body of the medical profession. It operates under the provisions of the Medical Profession Act, B.E. 2525 (1982 CE), which replaced series of earlier legislation dating to the council's foundation in 1923. Under the law, the council is tasked with: upholding the profession's ethics; supporting medical education, research and practice; uniting and upholding the dignity of its members; aiding and educating the general population and organizations on relevant matters; advising the government on medical and public health issues; and representing the medical profession in Thailand. The council is responsible for granting and revoking licences to practice medicine, as well as certification of medical education programmes and degrees. All licensed doctors are members of the council, and are entitled to elect members of its governing body, the Medical Council Committee, and its head, the President of the Medical Council, on a biennial basis. Reading law is the method by which persons in common law countries, particularly the United States, entered the legal profession before the advent of law schools. This usage specifically refers to a means of entering the profession (although in England it is still customary to say that a university undergraduate is "reading" a course, which may be law or any other). "Reading the law" consists of an extended internship or apprenticeship under the tutelage or mentoring of an experienced lawyer. A small number of U.S. jurisdictions still permit this practice today.

He was considered, along with Richard Hofstadter and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., to be one of the most influential historians of the postwar era, 1940s–1970s, both by scholars and by the general public. He was long a supporter of the approach of Charles A. Beard, stressing the influence of unseen economic motivations in politics. Stylistically, he was a master of irony and counterpoint. Woodward was on the left end of the history profession in the 1930s. By the 1950s he was a leading liberal and supporter of civil rights. After attacks on him by the New Left in the late 1960s he moved to the right politically.

**Question:** What genre is What's It Gonna Be due to its 4x4 rhythm?
**Answer:** UK garage

**Context:**
Balkania was the trade name of 'K. Zacharopoulos A.B.E.E.' a Greek industrial and trading company based in Athens that produced 4x4 jeep-type vehicles and 4x4 trucks. Since 1945, K. Zacharopoulos had been involved in vehicle repair and rebuilding. The "Balkania" company was founded in 1954 and since 1972 it imported Romanian and Indian vehicles. In 1975 it designed and introduced its own "Autotractor" model, a 4x4 multi-purpose truck with a Mercedes-Benz 3200 cc Diesel engine, metal cabin and a payload of 1500 kg . In 1979 the model was redesigned, with a modern synthetic (glass-fiber reinforced composite) cabin. It was produced, as some similar Greek vehicles, until a change of a favorable categorization for agricultural vehicles in 1984 limited its prospects (see also AutoDiana, Petropoulos). The vehicle was modestly successful, as it exhibited certain quality problems. PORTARO was the name of a popular Portuguese 4WD offroad utility vehicle which was based on the earlier Romanian original ARO 24 Series 4X4 model produced under license in Portugal. PORTARO 4WD models were made between 1975 until 1995. It was the second most successful Portuguese vehicle, second only to the UMM 4x4. The PORTARO name was an acronym of PORT for Portugal + ARO, the name of the main producer of the vehicle.

The first match of IPL 2011 saw defending champions Chennai Super Kings start off their title defense with a home game against Kolkata Knight Riders. Chennai captain MS Dhoni won the toss and elected to bat first. But it was Kolkata who got the start getting the wicket of Murali Vijay for 4 (4b, 1x4) in the first over. New batsman Suresh Raina then consolidated with Anirudha Srikkanth before accelerating, having some luck in the way as Yusuf Pathan dropped both batsmen, as Chennai reached a good score of 78/1 after 10 overs. Anirudha was dropped again, but next ball Raina was caught for 33 (29b, 4x4) off Pathan. MS Dhoni came to the crease, and despite having a good partnership with Anirudha who reached his half-century, Chennai were unable to up the run-rate. Jacques Kallis got Dhoni for 29 (21b, 1x4, 1x6) in the 18th over and followed it up by getting Anirudha out for 64 (55b, 6x4, 2x6) leaving Chennai 138/3 with 4 balls left before Albie Morkel's quick 15 (9b, 1x4, 1x6) got Chennai to 153/4 at the end of their 20 overs. Petersen's 4-Wheel & Off-Road is a magazine dedicated to 4x4 and off-road trucks and SUVs. The first issue was published in 1977; it began as a special-interest publication from the editors of Hot Rod magazine. "4-Wheel & Off-Road" covers a range of topics for the do-it-yourself light-truck enthusiast, including real-world 4x4 performance modifications, new products and product evaluations, off-road event coverage, new-vehicle evaluations, travel, and lifestyle. In March 1978, the magazine officially became a monthly publication, and in 2013, "4-Wheel & Off-Road" celebrated its 35th anniversary. The Dodge Warlock, originally a concept vehicle and part of Dodge's late 1970s "adult toys" line, is a wheelbase truck that was produced in limited production in 1976 and regular production from 1977 to 1979. They were available in 4x2 and 4x4 models. The 4X4 models were named Power Wagons. The 1978 models were offered only in black. There were utiline trucks available in any color. The warlock only came in black. Its main draw was that it was a factory customizable truck, also known as a "trick truck", and was designed to appeal to young 4x4 buyers. The Warlock featured custom wheels, wide tires, bucket seats, a Utiline bed, and oak racks for the bed. Optional equipment included five-spoke wheels, bucket seats, tinted glass, bright rear bumper, and power steering. All had black interiors accented by gold tape on the dash and the doors, and a "tuff" steering wheel. Like the standard pickups, it had front disc brakes, and a standard slant six or a V-8. The exterior was accented by gold pinstriping around the wheel wells and the body lines. the pinstriping continued inside onto the doors, dashboard, and instrument panel. Warlock was printed in gold on the tailgate. The 1979 model however is different in that it has "Warlock II" printed on the tailgate. It appears that all normal engine options were available. It could have come with the standard Slant six, the 318 with either the 2 barrel or 4 barrel carburetor, the 360, the 400, or the 440. The 318 appears to be the most common engine selected. Another 4x4 but a sequel and a "Different Rendition" to the original 4x4, the original plans were for a Freestyle 4x4 Reissue but with Collage and Denine replaced with Tolga and Noel, but instead they decided a new volume was necessary with Secret Society, Tolga, Stephanie and Meg. The 1953 MOWAG T 1 4x4 was modular. It was built: with an open loading ramp, with radio as a closed van, etc. In order to keep manufacturing, maintenance and repair simple and inexpensive, many parts of the U.S. Dodge car maker are used, especially from the Dodge WC. The Mowag T1 exist with or without a winch. Most MOWAG T1 4x4 were built as right-hand drive vehicles. Over 1600 cars were delivered in 7 different versions to the Swiss Army. MOWAG 4x4 T 1 were also supplied as emergency vehicles to fire and police departments. Bassline (sometimes referred to as bassline house, Niche or 4x4) is a type of music related to UK garage that originated in Sheffield in the early 2000s.

**Question:** Jamell Anderson plays for the basketball team from what city?
**Answer:** Ellesmere Port

**Context:**
The San Beda Red Lions is the collegiate varsity basketball team of San Beda College that plays in the NCAA. The juniors basketball team is called the Red Cubs of San Beda College-Rizal, while the women's varsity basketball team is called the Red Lionesses. The latter plays in the Women's National Collegiate Athletic Association. The Wellington WIZARDS Basketball Team was founded on January 29, 2010. The team is a Division 2 basketball team in Sierra Leone, with headquarters in the East of the capital city Freetown. The WIZARDS basketball team is made up of 12 players and a coach. The team uses the SLIMS Basketball Court as its playing ground. The team participated in its first league in February, which they won as Division 2 champions. The Cheshire Phoenix is a professional basketball team based in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Founded in 1984, they are members of the British Basketball League and play their home games at the Ellesmere Port Sports Village. Under previous ownership, the team was known as Cheshire Jets, but due to financial difficulties the franchise was withdrawn from the League in November 2012 and was replaced by the Phoenix.

Prior to that, from 1914 it was known under different names. The Big Blue Nation is the fan base of University of Kentucky (UK) athletics programs, particularly the men's basketball team, the women's basketball team and the football team. The Big Blue Nation is a reference to both the signature color of UK athletics (blue) and the fact that when the Wildcats play at a neutral site, the school's fans frequently make up a disproportionate majority of the crowd. For example, Yahoo! Sports columnist Pat Forde, a resident of Kentucky's largest city of Louisville, remarked after the 2014–15 men's basketball team finished its regular season undefeated,The Southeastern Conference tournament is in nearby Nashville, and you can expect the seats to be 90 percent blue when the Cats play. Then they'll start the NCAA tournament in Louisville's home area, the Yum Center ("sic"), in a city where about 40 percent of the population roots for UK. The following weekend assuredly will be spent in Cleveland, a manageable drive from the Bluegrass State, and the Final Four is in Indianapolis, which is 114 miles up I-65 from the Ohio River that separates Kentucky and Indiana. You could put NCAA tourney sites in Kabul, Marrakesh and Reykjavík, and Kentucky would have the most fans in the gym. But when you make the commute this easy, the Big Blue occupation will be overwhelming. Fans sometimes range beyond the borders of their nation, with anecdotal evidence suggesting the Wildcats men's basketball team once even drew a sizable horde of blue-clad supporters at an exhibition game in Japan. Jamell Anderson (born 6 July 1990) is a British professional basketball player who plays for British club Cheshire Phoenix as a forward.

**Question:** Which body of water flows through more states, Tamiami Canal or Genesee River?
**Answer:** Genesee River

**Context:**
Black Creek is a tributary of the Genesee River that runs for 46 mi in western New York, United States. The creek begins in Middlebury in Wyoming County and runs north for roughly the first half of its course and east for the other half, eventually joining the Genesee River in Chili, Monroe County. Its drainage area spans around 202 mi2 , which is largely rural and agricultural. As of 2000, 40,000 residents lived in the creek's drainage area. Crystal Lake is a 455 acre water body located in Belknap County in the Lakes Region of central New Hampshire, United States, in the town of Gilmanton. Crystal Lake is at the head of the Suncook River watershed. Water flows into Crystal Lake from the Belknap Range through Manning and Sunset lakes to the north. Water from Manning Lake enters Crystal Lake via Nelson Brook. Other waterways flowing into Crystal Lake include Wasson Brook and Mill Brook. Water flows out of a dam from the southern end of Crystal Lake via the Suncook Lakes and Suncook River to the Merrimack River. Shoreline development along Crystal Lake consists primarily of summer cottages, with a few year-round residents. Belknap Mountain and Mount Major can be seen from the shoreline. The Flagami is a neighborhood in Miami, Florida, United States, roughly defined as south and east of the Tamiami Canal, north of the Tamiami Trail (US 41/South Eighth Street), and west of Red Road (SR 959/West 57th Avenue), bisected by Flagler Street. Oatka Creek ( ) is the third longest tributary of the Genesee River, located entirely in the Western New York region of the U.S. state of New York. From southern Wyoming County, it flows 58 mi to the Genesee near Scottsville, draining an area of 215 sqmi that includes all or part of 23 towns and villages in Wyoming, Genesee, Livingston and Monroe counties as well. Its name means "leaving the highlands" or "approaching an opening" in Seneca. Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct, also known as the Broad Street Aqueduct or Broad Street Bridge, is a historic stone aqueduct located at Rochester in Monroe County, New York. It was constructed in 1836-1842 and originally carried the Erie Canal over the Genesee River. The overall length of the aqueduct including the wings and abutments is 800 ft . The aqueduct is 70 ft wide and has massive parapets on either side. It is one of four major aqueducts in the mid-19th century Erie Canal system. In 1927, a roadbed was added to carry automobile traffic and named Broad Street. It also carried a part of the Rochester Subway. A spring creek is a type of free flowing river whose name derives from its origin: an underground spring or set of springs which produces sufficient water to consistently feed a unique river. The water flowing in a spring creek may additionally be fed by snow pack or rain run-off, as in most traditional free-flowing rivers, but often the entire water source for a spring creek is an aquifer or other underground water source. For this reason, spring creeks are often filled with very pure, clean water and also demonstrate water flows that are smooth, consistent, and unwavering throughout the seasons of the year - unlike rivers filled with run-off or spring and summer melt-off from snow pack, whose water flows, water clarity, and water conditions often vary highly over the course of the year. In addition, water temperatures in spring creeks tend to vary less throughout the seasons of the year than traditional creeks and rivers because they are fed by underground water sources. Because of the depths of these water sources, spring creeks often emerge from their source or headwaters very cold and stay that way over the length of their runs. In addition, due to the consistent water flows and the fact that spring creek water is "pushed" by the force of pressure from the source rather than "pulled" by the force of gravity downhill, spring creeks can flow through very flat sections of land with minimal depths over grades that might not sustain run-off creeks and rivers. In these low-grade or flat sections of spring creeks, water flows can appear almost laminar with the surface of the creek appearing to be nearly flat and without the prominent riffles and surface disturbances caused by more rough or uneven surface bottoms found below free-stone run-off creeks and rivers surfaces. The Genesee River is a tributary of Lake Ontario flowing northward through the Twin Tiers of Pennsylvania and New York in the United States. Riverton, New York was a planned community built in 1973 in the town of Henrietta, New York, along the Genesee River. Riverton was seventh of the thirteen communities receiving Federal guarantee assistance from HUD as part of their New Communities Program created by the Urban Growth and New Community Development Act of 1970. $12 million was earmarked for the community. Riverton was supposed to encompass a 2335 acre land area bordered on the north by the New York State Thruway, on the west by the Genesee River, on the east by East River Rd., and on the south by the Rush-Henrietta town line, with some development continuing east along Erie Station Rd. Original plans called for construction to occur for a 16-year period and eventually house over 25,000 people, with the community including an 18-hole golf course, 12 swimming pools, 3 artificial lakes, a marina on the Genesee, and commercial and industrial centers. However, only a small portion of this was built along Scottsville-West Henrietta Rd. Created as part of the community were Riverton Knolls, a moderately priced townhouse subdivision, the Riverton Golf Club, a small 9-hole golf course, and the Riverton Park, which included a playground, baseball diamond, river front benches, walking trail, and a volleyball court. Also nestled in a bend in the Genesee was a 28 acre forested nature park. The Tamiami Canal or C-4 Canal, is a canal located in southern Florida in the United States. It flows in a west to east direction from the western part of the state in the Everglades past the Miami International Airport to a salinity control center near the Miami River. It averages 8 ft in depth and is over 100 ft wide in some areas. Genesee Valley Park is located in the south side of Rochester, New York along the shores of the Genesee River. The New York State Barge Canal (the currently in-use portion of the Erie Canal) crosses the Genesee River within the park. The University of Rochester is located near the park's north entrance.

**Question:** What is the primary duty of the Austrian Pinscher and the Maremma Sheepdog?
**Answer:** to guard

**Context:**
Seungjeongwon was the Royal Secretariat during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392 - 1910) in charge of receiving and delivering the king's order. The office was also called "Jeongwon", "Huwon", "Eundae", or "Daeeonsa". According to the "Gyeongguk daejeon" (Complete Codes of Law), the Seungjeongwon had 6 Royal Secretaries ("Seungji" 承旨), whose ranks were in the 3rd senior grade, as well as two recorders ("juseo" 注書). The duties of the royal secretaries were primarily to deliver the monarch’s orders to government organizations (under the Joseon administrative system the monarch never delivered his orders directly to any government office) and to report on official affairs of the state organizations to the throne. The six secretary system is explained by the fact that the government of Joseon was composed of six Boards (or Ministries). The six secretaries served respectively the Boards of Personnel, War, Taxation, Rites, Works, and Punishment. However, the secretaries were not limited to liaison work between the Six Boards and the monarch; they also reported to the king the business of all government offices, primary among these being the State Council ("Uijeong-bu"), the Office of Censor-General ("Saganwon"), and the Office of Inspector-General ("Saheon-bu"). As the name implies, the primary duty of the recorders was to make a record of all the official business handled by the secretaries. As the work of the secretaries had to be conducted at all hours, and it was required that they have ready access to the monarch at all times, the office the Seungjeongwon was established within easy reach of the king at court.

The Austrian Pinscher (Österreichischer Pinscher, FCI No. 64) is a medium-sized breed of pinscher-type dog from Austria, where dogs of the type were originally farm dogs, keeping barns free of rats and acting as home guards, livestock guardians, and drovers. The name originally given to the breed in 1928 was the "Österreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher" ("Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher") to differentiate it from similarly named breeds, but today in its country of origin the breed is officially called the Österreichischer Pinscher, or Austrian Pinscher in English. The Maremma Sheepdog, in Italian Cane da pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese, is a breed of livestock guardian dog indigenous to central Italy, particularly to Abruzzo and the Maremma region of Tuscany and Lazio. It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves. The literal English translation of the name is "The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region". The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where until recently shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially. The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator. Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the Šarplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey.

The Queen's Remembrancer (or King's Remembrancer) is an ancient judicial post in the legal system of England and Wales. Since the Lord Chancellor no longer sits as a judge, the Remembrancer is the oldest judicial position in continual existence. The post was created in 1154 by King Henry II as the chief official in the Exchequer Court, whose purpose was 'to put the Lord Treasurer and the Barons of Court in remembrance of such things as were to be called upon and dealt with for the benefit of the Crown', a primary duty being to keep records of the taxes, paid and unpaid. The first King's Remembrancer was Richard of Ilchester, a senior servant of the Crown and later Bishop of Winchester.
