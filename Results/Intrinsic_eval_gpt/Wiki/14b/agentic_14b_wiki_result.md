**Text:** Emilia was born in The Hague, the daughter of Lodewijk van Nassau, Lord of Beverweerd, the Governor of 's-Hertogenbosch, and his wife, Isabella, Countess of Hornes. Her elder sister, Elisabeth van Nassau-Beverweerd (1631–1717), became the wife of the prominent Stuart politician Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington; her brother was the famous Dutch field marshal Hendrik Van Nassau-Ouwerkerk. Emilia was married in Den Bosch in the Netherlands on 14 November 1659 to Thomas Butler, viscount Thurles (1633–1680), the eldest son and heir of the Irish peer James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, and accompanied him to England, where she was naturalized by Act of Parliament (1660). Lord Thurles became earl of Ossory several years later when his father achieved the dukedom (1662). The countess was presented to Catherine of Braganza, the wife of Charles II of England upon her arrival in London and was appointed as lady-in-waiting to the queen at Hampton Court Palace. She attended the queen at Greenwich Palace when the latter met her mother-in-law, Queen Henrietta Maria, for the first time (August 1662). During the outbreak of the plague (1665) the countess accompanied the queen and her household to the safety of Hampton Court, later removing to Oxford. She accompanied the king and queen to Dover to farewell the Duchesse d'Orleans on her final visit (June 1670). During the plots directed against the queen and other prominent Catholic figures, the countess and others of the queen's ladies came under the suspicion of being secret papists (1678).

Marshall co-directed " How the West Was Won" with John Ford and Henry Hathaway, handling the railroad segment, which featured a celebrated buffalo stampede sequence. While Marshall worked on almost all kinds of films imaginable, he started his career in the early silent period doing mostly Westerns, a genre he never completely abandoned. In the 1930s, he established a reputation for comedy, directing Laurel and Hardy in three classic films, and also working on a variety of comedies for Fox (Many of his films at Fox were destroyed in a vault fire in 1937). Later in his career, he was particularly sought after for comedies. He did around half a dozen films each with Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis, and also worked with W. C. Fields, Jackie Gleason, and Will Rogers. Drew Esocoff( born c. 1957) is an American television sports director, who as of 2006 has been the director of NBC Sunday Night Football.

**Text:** ** Barom Reachea V or Barom Reachea VIII ( born Ang Sô ; 1628–December 1672) was King of Cambodia from 1658 to 1672. Ang So was second son of regent Outey. In 1658, Ponhea Chan (Sultan Ibrahim) overthrew Outey and massacred his family. Ang So and his brother Ang Tan revolted against Chan. At first they were defeated and took refuge by Neak Ang Chov . The latter convinced them to seek help from Huế. Reinforced by a Vietnamese army, they took the offensive in October 1658. They defeated and killed their own brother Ang Em, whom had sided with Ponhea Chan, in a naval battle. The Vietnamese captured Chan, locked him in an iron cage and deported to Quảng Bình, where he soon died. Ang So ascended the throne under the name of Barom Reachea V. For Huế's help, Cambodia granted permission to the Vietnamese to settle in Cambodia, to own lands and agreed to pay tribute to Huế. In December 1672, he was killed and usurped by his nephew Chey Chettha III. Lyon Cohen( 1868–1937) was a Polish- born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer/ poet Leonard Cohen.

George Albert Smith (4 January 1864 – 17 May 1959) was an English stage hypnotist, psychic, magic lantern lecturer, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, inventor and a key member of the loose association of early film pioneers dubbed the Brighton School by French film historian Georges Sadoul. He is best known for his controversial work with Edmund Gurney at the Society for Psychical Research, his short films from 1897 to 1903, which pioneered film editing and close-ups, and his development of the first successful colour film process, Kinemacolor. Sonoda became internationally known for drinking a glass of water, collected from puddles under the reactor buildings at the radioactively polluted Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, during a press conference to prove the safety of the installed decontamination procedures. Jesse Edward Hobson( May 2, 1911 – November 5, 1970) was the director of SRI International from 1947 to 1955. Prior to SRI, he was the director of the Armour Research Foundation. Old Man Drinking a Glass of Beer (AKA: " Comic Faces") is a 1897 British short silent comedy film, directed by George Albert Smith, featuring a man drinking a glass of beer whose face and hands become increasingly lively as a result. The single-shot film shows Green, according to Bryony Dixon of BFIfilms, "performing what is known as a 'facial', that is a piece direct to camera showing changing facial expressions. The ability to get close up to the star was a great advantage that film had over the stage and early filmmakers were keen to exploit it."

Bahram Beyzaie's paternal grandfather, Mirzā Mohammad-Rezā Ārāni ("Ebn Ruh"), and paternal great-grandfather, the mulla Mohammad-Faqih Ārāni ("Ruh'ol-Amin"), were also notable poets. In spite of his somewhat belated start in cinema, Beyzai is often considered a pioneer of a generation of filmmakers whose works are sometimes described as the Iranian New Wave. His "Bashu, the Little Stranger" (1986) was voted "Best Iranian Film of all time" in November 1999 by a Persian movie magazine "Picture World" poll of 150 Iranian critics and professionals. Still, even before the outset of his cinematic career in 1970, he was a leading playwright (as well as theater historian), so much so that he is often considered the greatest playwright of the Persian language, and holds a reputation as "the Shakespeare of Persia." Since 2010, Beyzai has lived and taught at Stanford University, United States. Michael Govan( born 1963) is the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art since 2006.

Along with her husband, Louis Kirk, she produced a nature-themed series, "Kirk's Camera", for PBS, followed by twelve films before Louis Kirk's death in 1992. Richard Deo Daugherty( March 31, 1922 – February 22, 2014) was an American archaeologist and professor, who led the excavation of the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site in Washington state during the 1970s. The Ozette Indian Village, which was buried and preserved in a mudslide in the 1700s, has been called" most significant archaeological digs of the 20th century" in the Pacific Northwest. Daugherty collaborated closely with the Makah during the dig, which uncovered more than 55,000 artifacts. Daugherty was born in Aberdeen, Washington, in March 31, 1922. He developed an interest in archeology as a child when he found buried objects around Grays Harbor. He enlisted during World War II. Daugherty was based at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst in Lakehurst, New Jersey, where he flew blimps over the Atlantic to watch for potential German attacks.

He joined Washington State University as an assistant professor in 1954, where he taught for about thirty years, He eventually became the chairman of the department. In 1966, Daugherty joined with both Washington state U.S. senators, Sen. Henry M. Jackson and Warren Magnuson, to successfully pass the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. In 1970, a winter storm uncovered the remains of a pre-European village at Cape Alava, now known as the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site, which had been buried by a mudslide in the 1700s. Edward Eugene Claplanhoo, who was chairman of the Makah at the time, immediately recognized the significance of the discovery. Claplanhoo contacted Richard Daugherty at Washington State University. Daugherty and Claplanhoo had known each other since the 1950s. In the early 1950s, Daugherty has served as the WCU freshman class adviser when Claplanhoo held office as the freshman class treasurer. Daugherty sought the advice of Claplanhoo and other Makah leaders during the excavation. While it is common today to consult with local and indigenous communities, Daugherty's manner of working with Makah officials was considered revolutionary at the time. According to Janine Bowechop, a historic preservation officer for the Makah," He was so progressive at a time when it was so uncommon ...

**Text:** Daugherty taught people how tribes and scientists can work together." Claplanhoo lobbied on behalf of the Makah to keep the Ozette artifacts in local hands. The artifacts are now housed and displayed at the Makah Museum, which opened in 1979. In 2010, Ruth Kirk, an author of books on Ozette( and Daugherty's wife since 2007), spoke of Daugherty's and Claplanhoo close partnership on Ozette dig saying," Ed and Dick were really instrumental in getting the museum set up. Usually, back then, artifacts were taken back to the university, but here Dick always wanted them, and Ed worked with him because the Makah wanted them to stay in Neah Bay ... Now it is common to do that, but back then it was a new idea." Daugherty also directed the excavation of the Marmes Rockshelter, in which 10,000- year- old human remains were discovered, before the area was submerged by water due to the construction of the Lower Monumental Dam on the Snake River in 1969. Daugherty and Ruth Kirk, a nature writer, co-authored" Hunters of the Whale," which explored the early years of the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site through 1974. Kirk and Daugherty further published another book," Archaeology in Washington," released in 2007. Ruth Kirk and Daugherty, who were both widowed and longtime friends, married in 2007 in a wedding held in a historic replica of an Ozette- era longhouse. Richard Daugherty died in Pullman, Washington, on February 22, 2014, at the age of 91. He was a resident of the Panorama retirement community in Lacey, Washington, at the time.

**Text:** Richard Daugherty died in Pullman, Washington, on February 22, 2014, at the age of 91. He was a resident of the Panorama retirement community in Lacey, Washington, at the time. His wife, Ruth Kirk, had just completed a draft of a new book on the Ozette Indian Village a few days before his death. James Allenby- Kirk or simply James Kirk( born 1988) is a Scottish actor, comedian and writer. He is perhaps best known for his roles as Jeff the Chef in the comedy and as Stosh in the drama series. Theron Strinden( May 26, 1919 – March 3, 2011) was an American politician and businessman from North Dakota. Born in Litchville, North Dakota, Strinden went to college and then served in the United States Army during World War II. After the war, he returned to Litchville to work in his family's hardware and farm implement business. From 1963 to 1967 and 1969 to 1981, he served in the North Dakota State Senate and was President Pro Tempore of the North Dakota Senate. His younger brother Earl Strinden served in the North Dakota House of Representatives. Maximus of Tyre( fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic. His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really an Eclectic and one of the precursors of Neoplatonism.

**Text:** ** Mr. Right is a 2009 British film directed by David Morris and Jacqui Morris. The jointly- made gay- themed film is the debut for both directors. Robert Florey( 14 September 1900 – 16 May 1979) was a French- American director, screenwriter, film journalist and actor. Born as Robert Fuchs in Paris, he became an orphan at an early age and was then raised in Switzerland. In 1920 he worked at first as a film journalist, then as an assistant and extra in featurettes from Louis Feuillade. Florey moved to the United States in 1921. As a director, Florey's most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low- budget fillers for Paramount and Warner Brothers. His reputation is balanced between his avant- garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio- system director called on to finish troubled projects, such as 1939's" Hotel Imperial". He directed more than 50 movies. His most popular film is likely the first Marx Brothers feature" The Cocoanuts" of 1929, and his 1932 foray into Universal- style horror," Murders in the Rue Morgue" is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism. In 2006, as his 1937 film" Daughter of Shanghai" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called" widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films". " Right to know", in the context of United States workplace and community environmental law, is the legal principle that the individual has the right to know the chemicals to which they may be exposed in their daily living.

**Text:** Right to know", in the context of United States workplace and community environmental law, is the legal principle that the individual has the right to know the chemicals to which they may be exposed in their daily living. It is embodied in federal law in the United States as well as in local laws in several states. " Right to Know" laws take two forms: Community Right to Know and Workplace Right to Know. Each grants certain rights to those groups. The" right to know" concept is included in Rachel Carson's book" Silent Spring". Environmental illness shares characteristics with common diseases. For example, cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness. Influenza and heart disease include the same symptoms. Cyanide is one of the most toxic known substances, and failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment. This can contribute to prolonged illness and death. Les Côtelettes is a 2003 French drama film directed by Bertrand Blier. It was entered into the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Dying to Know Dangerous to Know is a 1938 crime film starring Anna May Wong, Akim Tamiroff, Gail Patrick, Lloyd Nolan, and Anthony Quinn. The movie was directed by Robert Florey. Bosley Crowther of" The New York Times" called the film a" second- rate melodrama, hardly worthy of the talents of its generally capable cast." It is based on British crime writer Edgar Wallace's hit 1930 play" On the Spot" which had been inspired by the career of Al Capone. Need to know is a category of classified information.

**Text:** ** Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV. Lisette Verea (August 27, 1914 - August 27, 2003) was a Romanian-born cabaret singer and actress, known for her appearance in the Marx Brothers film, "A Night in Casablanca" (1946). Night in Paradise is a 1946 American film produced by Walter Wanger and directed by Arthur Lubin. In 560 BC King Croesus of Lydia incurs the wrath of the sorceress Queen Attossa he had promised to marry, when he chooses the beautiful Delarai of Persia instead. Attossa, in disembodied form, mocks Croesus nearly to the point of madness, so he seeks a solution from the fortune- teller Aesop, who is very young and handsome, but believes that people only receive wisdom with age, arrived from the Isle of Samos in disguise of an old man with a hunch, a limp, and a cane. But Aesop also has eyes for Delarai. This expensive, lavish Technicolor production of plaster Grecian temples and painted skies was Wanger's second attempt to film the novel, and ended up costing$ 1.6 million and losing Universal some$ 800,000. One source describes it as a kitschy" Maria Montez vehicle without Maria Montez". ( The correct title is Night in Paradise, not" A Night in Paradise" as some sources have it.) Peter Pasetti( 1916–1996) was a German stage, television and film actor. He played a number of leading roles in post-Second World War productions such as the operetta film" A Night in Venice"( 1953).

**Text:** In the late 1960s, he produced a variety of experimental short stories (or "condensed novels"), such as those collected in the controversial "The Atrocity Exhibition" (1970). In the mid 1970s, Ballard published several novels, among them the highly controversial "Crash" (1973), a story about symphorophilia and car crash fetishism, and "High-Rise" (1975), a depiction of a luxury apartment building's descent into violent chaos. While much of Ballard's fiction would prove thematically and stylistically provocative, he became best known for his relatively conventional war novel, "Empire of the Sun" (1984), a semi-autobiographical account of a young British boy's experiences in Shanghai during Japanese occupation. Described by "The Guardian" as "the best British novel about the Second World War", the story was adapted into a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg starring Christian Bale. In the following decades until his death in 2009, Ballard's work shifted toward the form of the traditional crime novel. Several of his earlier works have been adapted into films, including David Cronenberg's controversial 1996 adaptation of "Crash" and Ben Wheatley's 2015 adaptation of "High-Rise". The literary distinctiveness of Ballard's fiction has given rise to the adjective "Ballardian", defined by the "Collins English Dictionary" as "resembling or suggestive of the conditions described in J. G. Ballard's novels and stories, especially dystopian modernity, bleak man-made landscapes and the psychological effects of technological, social or environmental developments". The "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" entry describes Ballard's work as being occupied with "eros, thanatos, mass media and emergent technologies".

**Text:** The couple soon traveled to Spain with a Cuban theatrical troupe. They worked on the Spanish stage, radio and film until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Fernando progressively began to take a backseat as actor and baritone and focused on promoting the career of his wife Mapy, who became a noted "vedette" (showgirl with star status) in Barcelona. After the Spanish Civil War interrupted their careers, the couple worked in New York, San Juan, Buenos Aires, Havana and Caracas, occasionally starring in movies. They arrived to Mexico City in late 1940 and made their stage debut at the Teatro Follies, in a show headlined by the popular Mexican comedian Cantinflas. Despite early struggles to become household names, Mapy achieved Mexican film stardom in late 1941 and the couple settled in Mexico City. Initially, Fernando Cortés played supporting roles in his wife's films. He then made a successful debut as director with "La pícara Susana" (1945) a comedy vehicle for his wife. On March 1954, Fernando and Mapy Cortés returned to Puerto Rico to help launch local television. Cortés became the first director at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2, and the couple co-starred in "Mapy y Papi", the first Puerto Rican sitcom. Despite their success on local TV, the couple returned the following year to Mexico City, which offered more opportunities. The couple starred in a Mexican version of their Puerto Rican sitcom and Mapy returned to the stage. Fernando Cortés became known as a reliable director of Mexican comedies on stage, television and film.

**Text:** The film is about an Eastern European man who becomes stuck in New York's John F. Kennedy Airport terminal when he is denied entry into the United States and at the same time is unable to return to his native country because of a military coup. The film is partially inspired by the 18- year stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in Terminal 1 of Paris- Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, from 1988 to 2006. After finishing his previous film," Catch Me If You Can", Spielberg decided to direct" The Terminal" because he wanted to make another film" that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world". Due to a lack of suitable airports willing to provide their facilities for the production, an entire working set was built inside a large hangar at the LA/ Palmdale Regional Airport, while most of the film's exterior shots were from the Montréal – Mirabel International Airport. The film was released in North America on June 18, 2004 to mixed reviews but was a commercial success, earning$ 77.9 million in domestic grosses and$ 219.4 million worldwide.

**Text:** Bernhart Otto Peter, 6th Prince of Sayn- Wittgenstein- Hohenstein( born 15 November 1962) is a German businessman and the current head of the Princely House of Sayn- Wittgenstein- Hohenstein. Johann Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach (Weimar, 12 July 1634 – hunting accident, Eckhartshausen, Marksuhl, 19 September 1686). He was the fifth but third surviving son of Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar and Eleonore Dorothea of Anhalt-Dessau. After the death of his father (1662), his older brother Johann Ernst II inherited Weimar, and his second brother Adolf Wilhelm received Eisenach. Johann Georg received an income from the new duchy of Saxe-Eisenach and took his residence in the small town of Marksuhl. In 1668 his brother Adolf Wilhelm died. His fifth and only surviving son, Wilhelm August, was born eight days after his father's death and became duke from the moment of his birth; Johann George became the regent of the duchy and also the guardian of the new duke. Wilhelm August died in 1671 at only two years of age, and Johann Georg inherited the duchy. The next year (1672) the death without heirs of the Duke Frederick Wilhelm III of Saxe-Altenburg forced a new treaty of division of the family lands between Johann Georg, his surviving brothers and his cousin. Johann Georg was confirmed in his possession of Eisenach and took some towns, and his younger brother, Bernhard, inherited Jena. Johann Georg thus became the founder of the most recent line of the dukes of Saxe-Eisenach, who became extinct in 1741.

**Text:** ** Wolfgang Schleif( 14 May 1912 – 21 August 1984) was a German editor, film director and screenwriter. He studied philosophy, psychology and pedagogy at the University of Leipzig. In 1934 he passed the State Examination for teachers at the Volksschule. But then he took classes at the Acting School of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, where he was trained in directing. Schleif began working in film in 1935. By 1938, he was an assistant director. In 1939, he became a screenwriter and eventually an editor. Among his assignments, he was one of the editors of the propaganda films" Jud Süß"( 1940) and" Kolberg"( 1945). In 1947, Schleif was joined the DEFA film studio, making his directorial debut in 1948 with the anti-capitalist production. This was followed by the 1949 film biography of Johann Friedrich Böttger," The Blue Swords". After 17 June 1953, Schleif emigrated to West Germany. With 1955 he managed an extraordinary success, which laid down his work but also for years on the production of such substances. He made several hit movies starring Freddy Quinn, but also war films such as" Rommel ruft Cairo" and crime films such as" Der rote Rausch" and, in the early seventies, back to the Immenhof films," Die Zwillinge von ImmenhofTwins from Immenhof") and" Frühling im ImmenhofSpring in Immenhof"). Since the mid-sixties Schleif worked extensively for television. He often led directed series and mini-series, particularly 1967 five episode series" Bürgerkrieg in RußlandCivil war in Russia").

**Text:** ** Facing Sudan is a documentary film released in 2007. It chronicles the situation in Sudan from independence in 1956, through civil war and the current crisis in Darfur. The narrative of Sudan is told through the eyes of activists from various segments of American society. Brian Burns—a young custodian who traveled to South Sudan in order to effect change there — supplies the arc in the film, and links the various stories together. The tagline of the film is" Ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Even in Sudan." The film premiered in March 2007 at the Longbaugh Film Festival in Portland, Oregon. It subsequently screened at fourteen film festivals and won" Best Documentary" awards at the Landlocked Film Festival and the Illinois International Film Festival. The film was produced, directed and edited by Bruce David Janu. The soundtrack was composed by Tom Flannery and Lorne Clarke. The film was released on DVD January 8, 2008.

**Text:** ** Russell "Lucky" Hayden (June 12, 1912 in Chico, California – June 9, 1981 in Palm Springs, California) was an American film and television actor. He is best known for his portrayal as Lucky Jenkins in Paramount's popular Hopalong Cassidy film series. He was born as Hayden Michael "Pate" Lucid, son of Francis J. Lucid and the former Minnie Harvey. He later took the name Russell Hayden to honor a friend, cameraman Russell Harlan. Lillian Porter (February 24, 1917, Alameda County, California – February 1, 1997, San Bernardino, California) was an American film and television actress. She retired after marrying Russell Hayden on July 11, 1946. They remained married until his death in 1981, but apparently the union was childless. She died in 1997, several weeks before her 80th birthday from undisclosed causes. Valley of Death may refer to: The Ancient Egyptian artisan Sennedjem lived in Set Maat( translated as" The Place of Truth"), contemporary Deir el- Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes, during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. Sennedjem had the title" Servant in the Place of Truth". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, in it there was regular furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he actually used when he was alive. His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs.

Dance of Death, also called" Danse Macabre", is a late- medieval allegory of the universality of death. Dance of Death or The Dance of Death may also refer to: Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group. Motherland may also refer to: " Where Was I?" may refer to: In Switzerland, the place of origin( literally" home place" or" citizen place") denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947.

**Text:** For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase" jus soli". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as" jus sanguinis"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's" country of birth". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's" place of birth" or" nationality at birth".

**Text:** ** S.N. Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab. Sir Alexander Korda (born Sándor László Kellner, 16 September 1893 – 23 January 1956) was a British film producer and director and screenwriter, who founded his own film production studios and film distribution company. Born in Hungary, where he began his career, he worked briefly in the Austrian and German film industries during the era of silent films, before being based in Hollywood from 1926 to 1930 for the first of his two brief periods there (the other was during World War II). The change led to a divorce from his first wife, the Hungarian film actress María Corda, who was unable to make the transition from silent films to "talkies" because of her strong Hungarian accent. From 1930, Korda was active in the British film industry, and soon became one of its leading figures. He was the founder of London Films and, post-war, the owner of British Lion Films, a film distribution company. Korda produced many outstanding classics of the British film industry, including "The Private Life of Henry VIIIRembrandtThings To ComeThe Thief of Baghdad" and "The Third Man". In 1942, Korda became the first filmmaker to receive a knighthood. Brian Patrick Kennedy( born 5 November 1961) is an Irish- born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.

It was Korda's most famous Hungarian film, better known than his literary adaptions. Korda himself considered the film his best work of the period. Dana Blankstein- Cohen( born March 3, 1981) is the director of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television. She is a film director, and an Israeli culture entrepreneur.

**Text:** ** Inkhosikati LaShongwe (b. Dzeliwe Shongwe 1927 – 2003) was Queen Regent of Eswatini between 21 September 1982 and 9 August 1983. She was a wife of king Sobhuza II of Eswatini, and with him had one child, Prince Khuzulwandle Dlamini. After the death of her husband in August 1982, the Royal Congress named Dzeliwe as Queen Regent, and Prince Sozisa Dlamini as the "Authorized Person", or regent's advisor, until Prince Makhosetive, designated by the king as his successor, reached the age of eighteen. The Liqoqo (a traditional advisory body) supported her regency, but soon there were disagreements between her Prime Minister, Mabandla Dlamini, and other members of Congress led by Mfanasibili Dlamini. These problems continued until 25 March 1983, when Prince Mabandla was replaced by Prince Bhekimpi Dlamini. Queen Dzeliwe opposed this dismissal, and this led to her being replaced by Ntfombi of Eswatini (the mother of Prince Makhosetive), as regent later that year. Prince Makhosetive was crowned on 25 April 1986 with the name of King Mswati III of Eswatini. In May, Mswati dissolved the Liqoqo, consolidating his power and reorganising the government. In May 1987, twelve people were accused of sedition and treason in relation to the overthrow of Queen Regent Dzeliwe in 1983.

**Text:** In May 1987, twelve people were accused of sedition and treason in relation to the overthrow of Queen Regent Dzeliwe in 1983. King Mswati created a special tribunal to judge these crimes against the King or the Queen Regent, in which the defendants did not have the right to legal representation. In March 1988, they were prosecuted by the tribunal, although they were set free in July. Between 1981 and 1985, Queen Dzeliwe also maintained the post of Joint President of the National Congress.

**Text:** ** South of the Clouds is a 2004 Chinese film and the second film directed by the writer Zhu Wen. The film stands in stark contrast to Zhu's previous film. In terms of production," South of the Clouds" received the cooperation of the state apparatus unlike 2001's" Seafood" which was an underground production shot on digital hand- held cameras. In terms of story, the transgressive tale of a prostitute and a policeman in" Seafood" is a far cry from" South of the Cloud"'s gentle tale of a retiree who fulfills a lifelong desire to travel to the southern province of Yunnan( literally" South of the Clouds"). " South of the Clouds" stars Li Xuejian as the protagonist, Xu Daqin, and features a cameo by director Tian Zhuangzhuang as the police chief in a small town in Yunnan. It was produced by China Film Assist, an independent production company in China;" South of the Clouds" was the company's first production. Colorado Territory is a 1949 American Western film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Joel McCrea, Virginia Mayo, and Dorothy Malone. Written by Edmund H. North and John Twist, and based on the novel" High Sierra" by W.R. Burnett, the film is about an outlaw who is sprung from jail to help pull one last railroad job. This version is a remake of the 1941 crime film" High Sierra" starring Humphrey Bogart, also directed by Walsh. The story was remade for a third time in 1955 as" I Died a Thousand Times" with Jack Palance and Shelley Winters. Won in the Clouds is a 1928 American silent film directed by Bruce M.

**Text:** ** Marie Antoinette (born Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna; 2 November 1755 – 16 October 1793) was the last Queen of France before the French Revolution. She was born an Archduchess of Austria and was the penultimate child and youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa and Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor. She became Dauphine of France in May 1770 at age 14 upon her marriage to Louis-Auguste, heir apparent to the French throne. On 10 May 1774, her husband ascended the throne as Louis XVI and she assumed the title Queen of France and Navarre, which she held until September 1791, when she became Queen of the French as the French Revolution proceeded, a title that she held until 21 September 1792. After eight years of marriage, Marie Antoinette gave birth to Marie Thérèse, the first of her four children. A growing percentage of the population came to dislike her, accusing her of being profligate and promiscuous and of harboring sympathies for France's enemies, particularly her native Austria. The Affair of the Diamond Necklace damaged her reputation further. During the Revolution, she became known as Madame Déficit because the country's financial crisis was blamed on her lavish spending and her opposition to the social and financial reforms of Turgot and Necker. Several events were linked to Marie Antoinette during the Revolution after the government had placed the royal family under house arrest in the Tuileries Palace in October 1789. The June 1791 attempted flight to Varennes and her role in the War of the First Coalition had disastrous effects on French popular opinion.

**Text:** ** Eureka Stockade is a 1907 Australian silent film about the Eureka Rebellion. It was the second feature film made in Australia, following" The Story of the Kelly Gang". It was made by George Cornwell, and his brother Arthur, who was a motor mechanic. Daniel Kelly (1 June 1861 – 28 June 1880) was an Australian bushranger and outlaw. The son of an Irish convict, he was the younger brother of the bushranger Ned Kelly. Dan and Ned killed three policemen at Stringybark Creek in northeast Victoria, near the present-day town of Tolmie, Victoria. With two friends, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, the brothers formed the Kelly Gang. They robbed banks, took over whole towns, and kept the people in Victoria and New South Wales frightened. For two years the Victorian police searched for them, locked up their friends and families, but could not find them. Dan Kelly died during the infamous siege of Glenrowan. More books have been written about the Kelly Gang than any other subject in Australian history. The Kelly Gang were the subject of the world's first full-length feature film, "The Story of the Kelly Gang", made in 1906.

**Text:** The drama films both revolve around the friends and ex-lovers of Jesse Metzger, a gay man in his mid-thirties who is forced to move back to his hometown from San Francisco due to financial reasons. The actors' own names, along with much of their real- life stories, were used for their characters in both films, which features graphic sexual scenes. The production of both films was aided by the gay pornographic studio NakedSword. This led to the full- length film being refused exemption from classification, which would have allowed it to screen at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival, a decision to which actor James Franco( who invited Mathews to collaborate on Franco's film" Interior. Leather Bar.") reacted negatively. Peter Schousboe, more fully Peter( or Peder) Kofod Ancher( or Anker) Schousboe( 1766 – 1832) was a Danish botanist. He was born in 1766 in Rønne, Denmark, and died in 1832 in Tangier, Morocco, having served as Danish consul general in Tangier from 1800 onwards. He conducted a botanical expedition in Spain and Morocco during the years 1791- 93. Among the plants that he was the first to describe was the popular garden flower" Salvia interrupta"; the bushwillow genus" Schousboea"( now considered a synonym of" Combretum") was named in his honour.

**Text:** The Siren of Seville" is preserved in a foreign archive; Filmmuseum EYE Institute, Amsterdam. Toto the Sheik is a 1950 Italian comedy film directed by Mario Mattoli and starring Totò. It is a parody of desert films such as" The Son of the Sheik" and" Siren of Atlantis". The Thief of Bagdad is a 1924 American silent swashbuckler film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Douglas Fairbanks, and written by Achmed Abdullah and Lotta Woods. Freely adapted from "One Thousand and One Nights", it tells the story of a thief who falls in love with the daughter of the Caliph of Baghdad. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Fairbanks considered this to be the favorite of his films, according to his son. The imaginative gymnastics suited the athletic star, whose "catlike, seemingly effortless" movements, were as much dance as gymnastics. Along with his earlier "Robin Hood" (1922), the film marked Fairbanks's transformation from genial comedy to a career in "swashbuckling" roles. The movie, strong on special effects of the period (flying carpet, magic rope and fearsome monsters) and featuring massive Arabian-style sets, also proved to be a stepping stone for Anna May Wong, who portrayed a treacherous Mongol slave. "The Thief of Bagdad" is now widely considered one of the great silent films and Fairbanks's greatest work. Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance writes, "An epic romantic fantasy-adventure inspired by several of the Arabian Nights tales, "The Thief of Bagdad" is the greatest artistic triumph of Fairbanks's career.

**Text:** Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance writes, "An epic romantic fantasy-adventure inspired by several of the Arabian Nights tales, "The Thief of Bagdad" is the greatest artistic triumph of Fairbanks's career. The superb visual design, spectacle, imaginative splendor, and visual effects, along with his bravura performance (leading a cast of literally thousands), all contribute to making this his masterpiece." The Thief of Bagdad is a 1940 British Technicolor Arabian fantasy film, produced by Alexander Korda, directed by Michael Powell, Ludwig Berger, and Tim Whelan, with additional contributions by Korda brothers Vincent and Zoltán and William Cameron Menzies. The film stars child actor Sabu, Conrad Veidt, John Justin, and June Duprez. It was distributed in the US and the UK by United Artists. Although produced by Alexander Korda's company London Films in London, due to the outbreak of World War II, the film was completed in California. " The Thief of Bagdad" won the Academy Awards for Cinematography, Art Direction( Vincent Korda) and Special Effects( Lawrence W. Butler, Jack Whitney) and marks the first major use of bluescreening in film. It was also nominated for Original Music Score( Miklós Rózsa), the first time a British film score had been recognized at the Academy Awards. Although this production is a remake of the 1924 version, the two films have differences, most significantly the thief and the prince are separate characters in the 1940 version. The first portion of this version of" The Thief of Bagdad" is told in flashback, mimicking the style of the" Arabian Nights".

He was the only son and successor of Pelagius, the first Asturian monarch, and was named after his paternal grandfather, who was the youngest son of Chindasuinth. In 737 he founded the Church of Santa Cruz, in his capital of Cangas de Onís, but aside from this, nothing else about his reign is known. He was said to have been killed by a bear on a hunt. The hunt was probably a political tool for fostering political ties within his court, a common medieval practice. Nonetheless, later chroniclers of the "Cronica ad Sebastianum" criticised him as given over to excessive levity. Favila was buried with his wife Froiluba in the Church of Santa Cruz de Cangas de Onís. According to the foundation inscription of Santa Cruz, he left children, but they did not succeed him. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law Alfonso, husband of his sister Ermesinda. Charles Francis Norton( 1807 – 1835) was a 19th- century Member of Parliament for Guildford.

**Text:** Known as" the Master of Suspense", he directed over 50 feature films in a career spanning six decades, becoming as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing of the television anthology" Alfred Hitchcock Presents"( 1955 – 1965). His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins. Born in Leytonstone, Essex, Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph- cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film" The Pleasure Garden"( 1925). His first successful film,( 1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, while his 1929 film," Blackmail", was the first British. Two of his 1930s thrillers," The 39 Steps"( 1935) and" The Lady Vanishes"( 1938), are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including" Rebecca"( 1940)," Foreign Correspondent"( 1940)," Suspicion"( 1941)," Shadow of a Doubt"( 1943), and" Notorious"( 1946). " Rebecca" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for" Lifeboat"( 1944) and" Spellbound"( 1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award. The" Hitchcockian" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear.

**Text:** The" Hitchcockian" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film" is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole." After a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with" Strangers on a Train"( 1951) and" Dial M For Murder"( 1954). By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films often ranked among the greatest of all time:" Rear Window"( 1954)," Vertigo"( 1958)," North by Northwest"( 1959), and" Psycho"( 1960) with the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations. In 2012," Vertigo" replaced Orson Welles's" Citizen Kane"( 1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world- wide poll of hundreds of film critics. By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, including his personal favourite," Shadow of a Doubt"( 1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before he died.

**Text:** ** uwantme2killhim? ( also known as U Want Me 2 Kill Him? and stylized as" Uwantme2killhim?") is a 2013 drama- thriller film directed by Andrew Douglas. The film stars Jamie Blackley and Toby Regbo and premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, where the two actors won the" Best performance in a British feature film" award. The film is loosely based on a true story and follows two schoolboys who are drawn into a complicated world of online chatrooms, eventually leading to one stabbing the other. The Lost Shadow( German: Der verlorene Schatten) is a 1921 German silent film directed by Rochus Gliese and starring Paul Wegener, Wilhelm Bendow and Adele Sandrock. The cinematographer was Karl Freund. The film's sets were designed by the art director Kurt Richter. It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios in Berlin. For some reason, the film was only released in the US in 1928. It is today considered a lost film. This film was a remake of sorts of Paul Wegener's 1913 film" The Student of Prague", which he had starred in, only this time giving the story a happy ending. The screenplay also incorporated the legend of the famed violinist Nicolo Paganini who was said to have murdered his wife and imprisoned her soul in his violin. Director Gliese had previously designed the sets for Wegener's 1915 film" The Golem", and later directed Wegener in" The Golem and the Dancing Girl" in 1917. He later also worked as a costume designer on Wegener's 1920 film" The Golem: How He Came into the World". Thus Gliese was the only person to collaborate on all three of Wegener's" Golem" movies.

This was the screen debut of Fritz Feld. It was produced by Deutsche Bioscop GmbH. " The Golem and the Dancing Girl" is now considered a lost film, though silentera.com reports a print may exist in an" eastern European film archive". Troy Howarth wrote,"( the film) remains one of the earliest filmed examples of a horror spoof ... makes it all the more regrettable that it has vanished so completely." Der Golem( shown in the US as The Monster of Fate) is a 1915 German silent horror partially lost film, written and directed by Paul Wegener and Henrik Galeen. It was inspired by an ancient Jewish legend, the most prevalent version of the myth involving 16th century Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel who created the Golem to protect his people from anti-Semites. Wegener claimed the film was based on Gustav Meyrink's 1915 novel" The Golem", but Troy Howarth states" it is more likely that( the screenwriters) simply drew upon European folklore". The film was the first of a trilogy produced by Wegener, followed by" The Golem and the Dancing Girl"( 1917) and( 1920).

The film shares parts of the plot with the 1936 French film, Le Golem, directed by Julien Duvivier, filmed in Prague and co-written by Jan Werich( this film's star and co-author) and Jiří Voskovec. It was originally directed by Jiří Krejčík, but after disputes with the leading actor Jan Werich, Krejčík was replaced by Martin Frič. In addition to the two- part version, a 112- minute- long one- part international version was prepared, with most propaganda flavoured scenes cut out( e.g., songs). The film was filmed in color( not common for Czechoslovak films in that period) because of the international release. The film is set during the reign of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor. It is one of the best known films with Jan Werich( performing a dual role of Emperor and baker). The Golem: How He Came into the World( also referred to as Der Golem) is a 1920 silent horror film and a leading example of early German Expressionism.

**Text:** The Golem" is based on the Jewish legend of the same name, and felt that the legend, which they referred to as" the Jewish Frankenstein", had never been properly developed into a film since the silent 1920 version. Originally it was intended to retain the original appearance of the title character for the film," In the beginning, when we just started on the idea for the movie, we tried to tell the story as it is. That is with the real giant creature made of mud and clay,". The idea was soon abandoned, however, after realizing that it would not fit with the story they wanted to convey, deciding instead to reimagine the classic tale for a more contemporary audience while staying true to its original themes. Principal photography for" The Golem" commenced in the summer of 2017 near Kiev, Ukraine, for a month and a half, with the majority of the film was shot in an isolated outdoor set," in the middle of nowhere". On April 24, 2018; it was announced that Dread Central had acquired distribution rights to" The Golem" as their first original production under their" Dread Central Presents" banner, with Epic Pictures serving as executive producers for a limited theatrical release slated for February 2019. The film later made its official premiere at the London FrightFest Film Festival on August 27, 2018. The film would later be released on DVD, Blu- Ray, and Video- on- Demand on February 5, 2019. " The Golem" received positive reviews from critics, who praised Furstenberg's performance, cinematography, and atmosphere; and was nominated for several awards by the Israeli Film Academy.

**Text:** ** Anacyndaraxes was the father of Sardanapalus, king of Assyria. Philip I of Boulogne (Philip Hurepel) (1200–1235) was a French prince, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis in his own right, and Count of Boulogne, Mortain, Aumale, and Dammartin-en-Goële " jure uxoris". He was the son of Philip II of France and his controversial third wife Agnes of Merania. Illegitimacy shadowed his birth and career, but he was legitimated by Pope Innocent III. He was associated with founding the Tour du Guet in Calais. He is the first recorded person to bear a differenced version of the arms of France. He was married in c. 1223 to Matilda II, Countess of Boulogne. Young Philip, by right of his wife, became Count of Boulogne, Mortain, Aumale, and Dammartin-en-Goële. He revolted against his sister-in-law Blanche of Castile when his elder half-brother Louis VIII died in 1226. When Philip died in 1235, Matilda continued to reign and was married to Afonso III of Portugal. Matilda and Philip had a son Alberic and daughter Joan, who both survived Philip. Alberic reportedly renounced his rights and went to England, for unknown reasons. Apparently he survived his mother and died in 1284. Joan of Boulogne married Gaucher de Châtillon in 1236. Philip II (21 August 1165 – 14 July 1223), known as Philip Augustus , was King of France from 1180 to 1223.

**Text:** Philip II (21 August 1165 – 14 July 1223), known as Philip Augustus , was King of France from 1180 to 1223. His predecessors had been known as kings of the Franks, but from 1190 onward, Philip became the first French monarch to style himself "King of France". The son of King Louis VII and his third wife, Adela of Champagne, he was originally nicknamed "Dieudonné" (God-given) because he was a first son and born late in his father's life. Philip was given the epithet "Augustus" by the chronicler Rigord for having extended the crown lands of France so remarkably. The only known description of Philip describes him as After a twelve-year struggle with the Plantagenet dynasty in the Anglo-French War of 1202–14, Philip succeeded in breaking up the large Angevin Empire presided over by the crown of England and defeated a coalition of his rivals (German, Flemish and English) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. This victory would have a lasting impact on western European politics: the authority of the French king became unchallenged, while the English King John was forced by his barons to sign Magna Carta and deal with a rebellion against him aided by Philip, the First Barons' War. The military actions surrounding the Albigensian Crusade helped prepare the expansion of France southward. Philip did not participate directly in these actions, but he allowed his vassals and knights to help carry them out. Philip transformed France from a small feudal state into the most prosperous and powerful country in Europe. He checked the power of the nobles and helped the towns to free themselves from seigneurial authority, granting privileges and liberties to the emergent bourgeoisie.

**Text:** Monika Linkytė and Vaidas Baumila were selected to sing the song on 21 February 2015. " Too Much Rain" is a song by Paul McCartney and is the seventh track on his 2005 album" Chaos and Creation in the Backyard". The song was recorded at George Martin's Air Studios in central London with producer Nigel Godrich. It was inspired by the theme to the 1936 film" Modern Times", written by Charlie Chaplin and commonly known as" Smile"( lyrics were added to Smile in 1954 by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons). The lyrics of" Too Much Rain" concern hope in the face of adversity(" Laugh when your eyes are burning/ Smile when your heart is filled with pain ..."). In addition to" Smile," McCartney has said the song was also inspired by his second wife, Heather Mills, who had" a lot of tough times in her life." Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the "King of Rock and Roll" or simply "the King". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues.

**Text:** Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in "Love Me Tender". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special "Elvis", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, "Aloha from Hawaii". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.

**Text:** ** Virgin Beauty is an album by Ornette Coleman and his Prime Time ensemble. It was released by Portrait Records in 1988. Art of Time Ensemble is a collective of Canadian- based classical, jazz and pop musicians, founded in 1998 by pianist/ artistic director, Andrew Burashko. The Art of Time Ensemble is a non-profit organization. Black Flowers is a 2009 album by the Canadian music organization Art of Time Ensemble featuring singer Sarah Slean. On May 10 and 11, 2007, Sarah Slean was the featured artist in the Art of Time Ensemble's Songbook series, which is" artistic director Andrew Burashko's pursuit to present music- avant- garde, popular, cabaret, jazz, classical- in ways audiences have n't experienced. Black Flowers" was released on June 2, 2009 through Pheromone Recordings. The Irish Descendants are a folk group from the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. All the members, born of Irish emigrants, were workers in the Newfoundland fishing industry before forming the band in 1990 out of the remnants of two former Newfoundland bands – The Descendants and Irish Coffee. The group helped to popularise traditional Newfoundland music to a wider Canadian audience in the early 1990s, along with other bands such as Great Big Sea. Their popularity within the province itself led to their selection as the official band of the province's 500th anniversary celebrations, during which they performed for the Queen. Tension within the group caused co-frontman D'Arcy Broderick to leave soon after this period, and their lineup has frequently changed since then, with frontman Con O'Brien being the only constant member. Regular touring and occasional album releases, most recently" Southern Shore" in 2007, have kept the group in the public eye.

Maximus of Tyre( fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic. His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really an Eclectic and one of the precursors of Neoplatonism. Andrew Lortie( or André Lortie) was a leading French theologian, author and emigre leader of Huguenot Protestants in England, born in France and resident of London at his death, heading the French church there. Lortie was a well- known author of books attacking the Holy See and transubstantiation and was an early, prominent Protestant theologian. Most Huguenot churches in the UK and US have since merged with Anglican- based or Reform- based Protestant churches. Victor E.

**Text:** ** Gabriel Urbain Fauré (12 May 1845 – 4 November 1924) was a French composer, organist, pianist and teacher. He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his "Pavane", Requiem, "Sicilienne", nocturnes for piano and the songs "Après un rêve" and "Clair de lune". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Fauré composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically complex style. Fauré was born into a cultured but not especially musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to the Ecole Niedermeyer music college in Paris, where he was trained to be a church organist and choirmaster. The Ecole Neidermeyer's pedagogy differed greatly from that of the Paris Conservatoire. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-Saëns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, Fauré earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the Église de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, Fauré was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic.

**Text:** By his last years, Fauré was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed by the president of the French Republic. Outside France, Fauré's music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime. Fauré's music has been described as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The "Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians", which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned. La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, is a song cycle by Gabriel Fauré, of ten mélodies for voice and piano. Composed during 1906–10, it is based on the collection of poetry of the same name by Charles van Lerberghe. It is Fauré's longest song cycle.

**Text:** The cover reuses the album cover from the 1995 version of "Greatest Hits". In 2003 a compilation album of the Human League's greatest hits with the same name was released by Virgin Records. The Human League are an English electropop/ synth- pop band formed in Sheffield in 1977. Initially an experimental electronic outfit, the group signed to Virgin Records in 1979 and later attained widespread commercial success with their third album" Dare" in 1981. The album contained four hit singles, including the UK/ US number one hit" Do n't You Want Me." The band received the Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 1982. Further hits followed throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, including" Mirror Man,( Keep Feeling) Fascination, The Lebanon, Human"( a US No. 1) and" Tell Me When." The only constant band member since 1977 has been lead singer and songwriter Philip Oakey. Keyboard players Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh both left the band in 1980 to form Heaven 17. Under Oakey's leadership, the Human League then evolved into a commercially successful New Pop band with a new line- up including female vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley. Since the mid-1990s, the band has essentially been a trio of Oakey, Catherall and Sulley with various sidemen.

As an early techno- pop( electropop) act who received extensive MTV airplay they are regarded as one of the leading artists of the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US. Philip Adrian Wright( born 30 June 1956) is an English musician, also known as Adrian Wright. Wright had studied film making at Sheffield Art College and was a friend of Philip Oakey. In 1978, he was invited to join the new avant- garde electronic band The Human League which composed of Oakey, Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh. Then a non-musician, Wright was appointed as' Director of Visuals' whose job was to provide lighting and slideshows to accompany the Human League ’s live concerts. When the Human League split in October 1980, Wright sided with Oakey, while Ware and Marsh left to form Heaven 17. Necessity forced him to become a musician and he quickly learned keyboards. He and Oakey co-wrote some of the new Human League's songs including the number one hit" Do n't You Want Me", plus tracks such as" Darkness I Am the Law" and" The Things That Dreams Are Made Of" for the album" Dare". Wright is also credited with the iconic album sleeve design for" Dare". He remained a key member of the Human League during the early 1980s both as a composer and keyboard player. He left the band in 1986 after becoming disillusioned with the musical direction Oakey was taking and feeling marginalized by their new producers during the recording of the album" Crash" in Minneapolis. After The Human League, he worked in film before moving into design.

Charles Philip" Chappie" Fox( May 27, 1913 – September 12, 2003) was a circus historian and philanthropist born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who greatly expanded the Circus World Museum and helped found the Great Circus Parade in Milwaukee. Fox took over the tiny museum, in Baraboo, Wisconsin, in 1960, and began to collect and restore antique circus wagons. These wooden wagons had been built in the late 19th and early 20th century, and lay in disrepair across the United States and Europe. Today, the museum owns over 200 of these wagons. In 1963, Fox and Ben Barkin, under the sponsorship of the Schlitz Brewing Company, began the Great Circus Parade. A self- trained circus historian, Fox wrote and edited many books about circus animals, advertising and imagery, and also authored many children's stories. He died of heart disease at a nursing home in Baraboo and is survived by his wife Sophie and daughter, Barbara Fox McKellar. The Great Circus Mystery is a 1925 American adventure film serial directed by Jay Marchant. Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre.

**Text:** In the British Army during World War II, latterly as an officer, he received the nickname "Vivian" because the British could not pronounce "Chaim". He returned to Palestine after the war and, following the end of the British Mandate and Israel's Declaration of Independence in 1948, operated in the battles for Latrun during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He retired from the Israel Defence Forces in 1962 with the rank of major-general. After leaving the military, Herzog practised law. In 1972 he was a co-founder of Herzog, Fox & Ne'eman, which would become one of Israel's largest law firms. Between 1975 and 1978 he served as Israel's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, in which capacity he repudiated UN General Assembly Resolution 3379—the "Zionism is Racism" resolution—and symbolically tore it up before the assembly. Herzog entered politics in the 1981 elections, winning a Knesset seat as a member of the Alignment. Two years later, in March 1983, he was elected to the largely ceremonial role of President. He served for two five-year terms before retiring in 1993. He died four years later and was buried on Mount Herzl, Jerusalem. His son Isaac Herzog has led the Israeli Labor Party and the parliamentary Opposition in the Knesset between 2013 and 2017.

The aura stage precedes a generalized or grand mal seizure in epilepsy, as the side- effects of a focal seizure( s) or petit mal( s) which may or may not be followed by a generalized or grand mal seizure or seizures, but can happen at any stage of a migraine.

**Text:** It often manifests as the perception of a strange light, an unpleasant smell, or confusing thoughts or experiences. Some people experience aura without a subsequent migraine or seizure( see silent migraine). Auras vary by individual experience; some people experience smells, lights, or hallucinations. Less known symptoms of the eye include disturbances, where the eyes roll in the back of the head caused by photosensitivity. A sufferer of this type of aura may experience tearfulness of the eyes and uncontrollable sensations of light followed by reduced symptoms after approximately 20 minutes; it is the rarest type of aura. Auras, when they occur, allow some people who have epilepsy time to prevent injury to themselves and/ or others. The time between the appearance of the aura and the migraine lasts from a few seconds up to an hour. The aura can stay with a migraine sufferer for the duration of the migraine; depending on the type of aura, it can leave the person disoriented and confused. It is common for migraine sufferers to experience more than one type of aura during the migraine. Most people who have auras have the same type of aura every time. It is hypothesized that the nature of epileptic auras are determined by the part or parts of the brain in which an individual's seizures originate. Auras can also be confused with sudden onset of panic, panic attacks or anxiety attacks, which creates difficulties in diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of patients who experience symptoms of paresthesias, derealization, dizziness, chest pain, tremors, and palpitations can be quite challenging. Aura Herzog, née Ambache (Hebrew: אורה הרצוג born December 24, 1924) is a social activist and the widow of Chaim Herzog, sixth president of the State of Israel. In 1968, she founded Council for a Beautiful Israel.

Motherland may also refer to: The Ancient Egyptian artisan Sennedjem lived in Set Maat( translated as" The Place of Truth"), contemporary Deir el- Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes, during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. Sennedjem had the title" Servant in the Place of Truth". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, in it there was regular furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he actually used when he was alive. His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.

**Text:** If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase" jus soli". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as" jus sanguinis"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.

**Text:** There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's" country of birth". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's" place of birth" or" nationality at birth". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

Born in Detroit, she currently lives in Los Angeles. She is partners with chef Susan Feniger( of Food Network's" Too Hot Tamales"). Tan Kheng Seong ( Simplified Chinese: 陈庆祥), better known by his stage name Ah Niu or Ah Gu , is a Malaysian Chinese singer in Malaysia and Singapore. In 1997, his popularity was restricted to mainly Malaysia and Singapore, until Richie Jen (Traditional Chinese:任賢齊, Taiwanese singer) sung his song ( Dui Mian De Nü Hai Kan Guo Lai- " direct translation = Look over here, girl in front of me") which became widely popular. In December 1998, Rock Records sent Ah Niu to expand his singing career in Taiwan. He quickly gained popularity with the Taiwanese masses with his brand of quirky, folk-ish songs that mainly focused on his daily life as a kampung boy in Malaysia and unrequited love. His popularity gained even more momentum when the likes of Rene Liu and Karen Mok requested Ah Niu to compose songs for them which steadfastly placed him as a firm staple not only in Taiwan, but also in China and Hong Kong. Ah Niu has been a special guest for many concerts around Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. Ah Niu had his first solo concert in Malaysia Genting Highland after 18 years of debut on 28 February 2015 with a total of 5,000 audience and with Richie Jen as the concert's special guest.

Lincoln was known to be impulsive and unrestrained, and he did not attend school during his father's lifetime. He had free run of the White House, and there are stories of him interrupting presidential meetings, collecting animals, and charging visitors to see his father.

**Text:** ** John Vernou" Black Jack" Bouvier III( May 19, 1891 – August 3, 1957) was an American Wall Street stockbroker and socialite. He was the father of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and of socialite Lee Radziwill, and was the father- in- law of John F. Kennedy. Tlacaelel I (1397 – 1487) was the principal architect of the Aztec Triple Alliance and hence the Mexica (Aztec) empire. He was the son of Emperor Huitzilihuitl and Queen Cacamacihuatl, nephew of Emperor Itzcoatl, father of poet Macuilxochitzin, and brother of Emperors Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I. During the reign of his uncle Itzcoatl, Tlacaelel was given the office of Tlacochcalcatl, but during the war against the Tepanecs in the late 1420s, he was promoted to first adviser to the ruler, a position called "Cihuacoatl" in Nahuatl, an office that Tlacaelel held during the reigns of four consecutive "Tlatoque", until his death in 1487. Tlacaelel recast or strengthened the concept of the Aztecs as a chosen people, elevated the tribal god/hero Huitzilopochtli to top of the pantheon of gods, and increased militarism. In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Durán).

**Text:** In tandem with this, Tlacaelel is said to have increased the level and prevalence of human sacrifice, particularly during a period of natural disasters that started in 1446 (according to Diego Durán). Durán also states that it was during the reign of Moctezuma I, as an invention of Tlacaelel that the flower wars, in which the Aztecs fought Tlaxcala and other Nahuan city-states, were instigated. To strengthen the Aztec nobility, he helped create and enforce sumptuary laws, prohibiting commoners from wearing certain adornments such as lip plugs, gold armbands, and cotton cloaks. He also instigated a policy of burning the books of conquered peoples with the aim of erasing all memories of a pre-Aztec past. When he dedicated the seventh reconstruction of the Templo Mayor in Tenochtitlan, Tlacaelel had brought his nation to the height of its power. The dedication took place in 1484 and was celebrated with the sacrifice of many war captives. After Tlacaelel's death in 1487, the Mexica Empire continued to expand north into the Gran Chichimeca and south toward the Maya lands. Harry James Smith( July 30, 1888 – November 20, 1962) was an American long- distance runner. He was most notable for competing in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.

During the conflict, she was a patron of three military hospitals in Harrogate, which she financed generously.

He taught at Upper Canada College until he joined the Royal Canadian Navy at the outbreak of the war in 1939. Little presented himself at HMCS York in Toronto, but after he mentioned that he was a teacher of German and that he had just returned from a trip to Germany, he was immediately sent to Ottawa. Upon his arrival he was asked to go through some captured German documents, some of which seemed to describe a weapon. Those papers were sent to London and were found to be partial plans for the new magnetic mines being used by the German Navy. During the war he served as Director of Naval Intelligence on the Naval Staff. Because of his position he was one of the few Canadians to handle Ultra decrypts. After the defeat of Nazi Germany he was allowed to enter combat and was sent to join the British Pacific Fleet.

The Blonde from Singapore( also released as Hot Pearls) is a 1941 American adventure film directed by Edward Dmytryk. De Sacia Mooers ( November 19, 1888 – January 11, 1960) was a film actress, disputably from Los Angeles, California. She appeared in over one hundred movies in the silent film era. She was perhaps best known as the" Blonde Vamp" for her role in" The Blonde Vampire" in 1922. Her career ended with talking films. Edward Dmytryk( September 4, 1908 – July 1, 1999) was a Canadian- born American film director. He was known for his 1940s noir films and received an Oscar nomination for Best Director for" Crossfire"( 1947).

**Text:** During the 1950s, Klimovsky settled in Spain, where he became a full-time "professional" director. He directed many spaghetti westerns and "exploitation films", filming in Mexico, Italy, Spain and Egypt. Horror film fans best remember him for his contributions to Spain's horror film genre, beginning with "La Noche de WalpurgisWalpurgis Night"), the film that is said to have started the Spanish horror film boom of the 1970s. Klimovsky directed famed Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy in no less than 9 films in the 1970s, while also directing other classic horror films such as "The Strange Love of the VampiresThe Dracula Saga" and "The Vampires' Night Orgy". Naschy complimented Klimovsky's workmanlike attitude and abundant energy, but he always felt that Klimovsky rushed through many of their projects together, never allowing for sufficient retakes. León Klimovsky always dreamt of doing great mainstream movies but ended up doing commercial exploitation films, but he had no remorse, as cinema was a vocational mandate for him. He retired from directing in 1979, at age 73. In 1995, at age 89, he won the "Honor Award" from the Spanish Film Directors Association. He died the following year in Madrid from a heart attack. He was the brother of noted Argentinian mathematician and philosopher Gregorio Klimovsky. Dana Blankstein- Cohen( born March 3, 1981) is the director of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television.

My Little Eye is a 2002 British horror film directed by Marc Evans about five adults who agree to spend six months together in an isolated mansion while being filmed at all times.

**Text:** He translated from Benedetto Croce ("Aesthetic", 1922) and Niccolò Machiavelli ("The Mandrake", 1926). Initially, Nenițescu's poetry was discursive and religious, in line with the "Gândirist" current. His verse became progressively more hermetic, as can be seen in the anthology volume "Ani" (1973). Including texts published in the 1940s and '50s, it reveals the intellectualized lyric verse of an eminently classical nature. Ioan S. Nenițescu (April 11, 1854–February 23, 1901) was a Romanian poet and playwright. Born in Galați, his parents were Ștefan Vasiliu, a manual laborer, and his wife Elisabeta ("née" Zaharia). After completing the Alexandru Ioan I commercial school in his native town , he finished high school, passing the exit examination at Iași. He also audited courses at Iași University's literature faculty. Nenițescu attended an officers' school, volunteered in the Romanian War of Independence and was wounded at Grivitsa. He then studied at the philosophy faculty of Berlin University, taking a doctorate in 1887 at Leipzig University with a thesis on Baruch Spinoza. He worked as a schoolteacher and inspector in Bucharest. He traveled south of the Danube, a trip that resulted in an ample "ethnic and statistical study of the AromaniansDe la românii din Turcia Europeană", 1895). He sat in the Assembly of Deputies for his native Covurlui County, and also served as prefect of Tulcea County in the Dobruja region.

**Text:** ** The Tom Bowl is a fan- supported college football bowl game scheduled to be played annually at Frank A. Schafer Field in Beal City, Michigan. The game is not sanctioned by the NCAA. It annually invites the# 1 and# 2 teams in the nation to play in a college football championship game. Although the group formally invites college teams every year to play in the bowl, no school has ever accepted an invitation. However, some athletic directors and conference presidents/ commissioners have sent response letters, declining while sarcastically telling the group that it was an honor to be invited. Responses have been received from Jim Delany, Jack Swarbrick, and Pat Richter, among others. The Tom Bowl started in 1989 by a group of fans with invitations extended to the University of Colorado and the University of Miami. Colorado declined the invitation and alternate teams of Middle Tennessee State and Eastern Michigan were invited. From 1990 to 2006, the Tom Bowl annually invited the top two teams unless those teams played each other in another bowl game. In those years the Tom Bowl has elected to have alternative games such as a battle between the# 3 and# 4 teams to determine the" true# 2" or as in 2002, the Big Ten Championship when Iowa and Ohio State did n't play during the regular season. Following the 2005 season, the Tom Bowl broke with tradition and used a BCS- like formula to invite three teams: USC, Texas, and Penn State to play in Tom Bowl XVII. Predictably, none of the teams showed up( though the Pac- 10 replied, apparently accepting the invitation but pledging not to show up on behalf of USC) and only twelve spectators did. The game was declared a 0- 0- 0 tie.

In 2007, the Tom Bowl devised a new format where the top three teams were invited to play in a round- robin tournament style game with each team playing each other for a half. The Tom Bowl has used this formula ever since, although in 2009 invites were extended to six different teams including Emory University, which boasts of being undefeated since 1836 because they do not have a football team.

He led Sagaing during the most tumultuous period of the kingdom (1356−64). Despite a brief period of alliance with Pinya (1357−59), Sagaing had to face near-annual raids by the northern Shan state of Mong Mao (Maw) on its own. He lost power in April 1364 when Maw Shan forces sacked Sagaing. He escaped capture but was soon put to death by his stepson Thado Minbya at Kya-Khat-Wa-Ya, south of Sagaing. " Where Was I?" may refer to: The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred.

**Text:** The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase" jus soli". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as" jus sanguinis"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise.

**Text:** There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's" country of birth". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's" place of birth" or" nationality at birth". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

**Text:** He was the second son of Shah Alam II and the father of Bahadur Shah II. Akbar had little de facto power due to the increasing British influence in India through the East India Company. He sent Ram Mohan Roy as an ambassador to Britain and gave him the title of Raja. During his regime, in 1835, the East India Company (EIC) discontinued calling itself subject of the Mughal Emperor and issuing coins in his name. The Persian lines in the Company's coins to this effect were deleted. Akbar II is credited with starting the Hindu-Muslim unity festival Phool Walon Ki Sair. His grave lies next to the dargah of 13th century Sufi saint Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki at Mehrauli. Ali Gohar (25 June 1728 – 19 November 1806), historically known as Shah Alam II, was the sixteenth Mughal Emperor and the son of Alamgir II. Shah Alam II became the emperor of a crumbling Mughal empire. His power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in the Persian language, "Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam", meaning, 'The empire of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', Palam being a suburb of Delhi. Shah Alam faced many invasions, mainly by the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdali, which led to the Third Battle of Panipat between the Maratha Empire, who maintained suzerainty over Mughal affairs in Delhi and the Afghans led by Abdali.

**Text:** ** PR Man Singh is an Indian former cricket player and administrator. He was the manager of the Indian team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Maharaja Man Singh (3 February 1783 – 4 September 1843) was the last independent Maharaja of Marwar Kingdom and Jodhpur State (r. 19 October 1803 – 4 September 1843). He was appointed as Heir Apparent by his grandfather Vijay Singh on 7 November 1791. However upon Vijay Singhs death, Bhim Singh seized Jodhpur and proclaimed himself as the ruler of Marwar. Man Singh was sent to Jalore for his own safety, where he remained throughout the reign of his cousin, Maharaja Bhim Singh of Marwar. He succeeded on his cousins death on 19 October 1803. In 1804 Man Singh broke the treaty with the British for cooperation and formed an alliance with Yashwantrao Holkar, however Jodhpur was invaded by Sindhia and was forced to break their alliance with Holkar and pay heavy tribute. Opposed by many of his principal nobles throughout his reign, he depended on the support of successive factions. The last of these were the Nath family, the Maharaja’s spiritual advisers, who came to control state affairs and turned him into a recluse. Many of the nobles fled to neighbouring principalities, state repression having become entirely vengeful and cold-blooded. Man Singh had wanted to marry Krishna Kumari after his cousin's death. Man Singh after finding it unbearable to see his kingdom get destroyed by the Sindhias and his own corrupt nobles and ministers, entered into treaty relations with the British on 6 January 1818.

**Text:** He held Auxerre, Maligny, Ervy, Troyes, and Châteauvillain as fiefs from Odo II, Duke of Burgundy. He was the son of Stephen II, Count of Blois, and Adela of Normandy, and the elder brother of King Stephen of England. Although he was the second son, Theobald was appointed above his older brother William. Several historians have painted William as mentally deficient, but this has never been substantiated. However, we know that his mother found him stubbornly resistant to control and unfit for wide-ranging comital duties. Theobald had no such problems. Theobald accompanied his mother throughout their realm on hundreds of occasions and, after her retirement to Marcigney in 1125, he administered the family properties with great skill. Adela died in her beloved convent in 1136, the year after her son Stephen was crowned king of England. King Louis VII of France became involved in a war with Theobald by permitting Count Raoul I of Vermandois and seneschal of France, to repudiate his wife Eleanor, Theobald's sister, and to marry Petronilla of Aquitaine, sister of the queen of France. The war, which lasted two years (1142–1144), was marked by the occupation of Champagne by the royal army and the capture of Vitry-le-François, where many persons perished in the deliberate burning of the church by Louis. The scholastic Pierre Abélard, famous for his love affair with and subsequent marriage to his student Héloïse, sought asylum in Champagne during Theobald II's reign. Abelard died at Cluny Abbey in Burgundy, a monastery supported by the Thebaudians for many centuries.

**Text:** His grandfather, Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans, was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England by his mistress Nell Gwynne. Beauclerk married Jane Roberts, daughter of Sir Walter Roberts, 6th Baronet of Glassenbury( 1691 – 1745) and his wife Elizabeth Slaughter, only daughter and heiress of William Slaughter, of Rochester, county Kent. Jane Roberts died on 16 December 1778 without issue. On Beauclerk's death in 1786, his titles passed to his cousin, George Beauclerk. He was High Steward of Windsor in 1751, a Lord of the Bedchamber in the same year, and Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire from 1751 – 1760 and again from 1771- 1786. He died in Brussels. Jane Wigham( née Smeal; 1801–1888) was a leading Scottish abolitionist. She was the stepmother of Eliza Wigham and the second wife of John Wigham. Charles II (29 May 1630 – 6 February 1685) was king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. He was king of Scotland from 1649 until his deposition in 1651, and king of England, Scotland and Ireland from the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy until his death. Charles II was the eldest surviving child of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland and Henrietta Maria of France. After Charles I's execution at Whitehall on 30 January 1649, at the climax of the English Civil War, the Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II king on 5 February 1649. However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a "de facto" republic led by Oliver Cromwell.

**Text:** However, England entered the period known as the English Interregnum or the English Commonwealth, and the country was a "de facto" republic led by Oliver Cromwell. Cromwell defeated Charles II at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, and Charles fled to mainland Europe. Cromwell became virtual dictator of England, Scotland and Ireland. Charles spent the next nine years in exile in France, the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy, and Charles was invited to return to Britain. On 29 May 1660, his 30th birthday, he was received in London to public acclaim. After 1660, all legal documents stating a regnal year did so as if he had succeeded his father as king in 1649. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Charles acquiesced to the Clarendon Code even though he favoured a policy of religious tolerance. The major foreign policy issue of his early reign was the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1670, he entered into the Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his cousin King Louis XIV of France. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date. Charles attempted to introduce religious freedom for Catholics and Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence, but the English Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic.

**Text:** In 1679, Titus Oates's revelations of a supposed Popish Plot sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, was a Catholic. The crisis saw the birth of the pro-exclusion Whig and anti-exclusion Tory parties. Charles sided with the Tories, and, following the discovery of the Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James in 1683, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved the English Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death in 1685. He was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed. Charles was one of the most popular and beloved kings of England, known as the "Merry Monarch", in reference to both the liveliness and hedonism of his court and the general relief at the return to normality after over a decade of rule by Cromwell and the Puritans. Charles's wife, Catherine of Braganza, bore no live children, but Charles acknowledged at least twelve illegitimate children by various mistresses. He was succeeded by his brother James. George Beauclerk, 4th Duke of St Albans ( 5 December 1758 – 10 February 1787) was the son of Lt.- Col. Charles Beauclerk and a great- grandson of Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans.

**Text:** Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer( 1223 – 4 August 1265) was an important ally of Simon de Montfort during the reign of Henry III. He served briefly as" Justiciar" of England in 1260 and as Constable of the Tower of London. Hugh Le Despenser, chief justiciar of England, first played an important part in 1258, when he was prominent on the baronial side in the Mad Parliament of Oxford. In 1260 the barons chose him to succeed Hugh Bigod as Justiciar, and in 1263 the king was further compelled to put the Tower of London in his hands. He was the son of Hugh le Despenser and was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort. Hugh was summoned as Lord Despencer Dec. 14, 1264 and was Chief Justiciar of England and a leader of the baronial party, and so might be deemed a baron, though the legality of that assembly is doubtful. He remained allied with Montfort to the end, and was present at the Battle of Lewes. He was killed fighting on de Montfort's side at the Battle of Evesham in August, 1265. He was slain by Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Wigmore; this caused a feud to begin between the Despencer and the Mortimer families. By his wife, Aline Bassett, he was father of Hugh Despenser' the elder', Earl of Winchester. Aline was the daughter of Philip Basset, who had also served as Justiciar. They also had a daughter named Eleanor le Despencer, who married Sir Hugh de Courtenay, feudal baron of Okehampton.

**Text:** Aline was the daughter of Philip Basset, who had also served as Justiciar. They also had a daughter named Eleanor le Despencer, who married Sir Hugh de Courtenay, feudal baron of Okehampton. Margery( Margaret) le Despencer, de jure suo jure 3rd Baroness le Despenser( 1387 creation), was the daughter and heiress of Philip le Despencer, 2nd Baron le Despencer. She was born about 1397 in Nettlestead, Suffolk, England, and married John de Ros, 7th Baron de Ros. He died without heirs, and she married secondly Roger Wentworth of Nettlestead, Esq.( d.1452), son of John Wentworth of North Elmsall. Thomas le Despenser, 2nd Baron Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester KG( 22 September 1373 – 13 January 1400) was the son of Edward le Despenser, 1st Baron le Despencer, whom he succeeded in 1375. Elizabeth Despencer, 3rd Baroness Burghersh( c. 1342 – August 1402) was an English noblewoman born to Bartholomew de Burghersh, 2nd Baron Burghersh and Cicely Weyland. Some recently constructed genealogies purport that she was first married, some time after 1347, to Maurice FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Kildare( d. 25 August 1390) and by him had at least four children. Yet it is more consistent with known dates of death of the 4th Earl of Kildare that he married instead Margaret, a daughter of the 1st Baron Burghersh.

Otherwise there would be record of Kildare's divorce from Elizabeth and probably a mention in the original records of her' remarriage' rather than of her' marriage' to le Despencer. She was married( it is said for the second time) some time before 1373, to Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer( c. 24 March 1335- 6 – 11 November 1375) and they had six children. Upon the death of her father on 5 April 1369, she inherited the title of Baroness Burghersh. Hugh le Despenser, 2nd Baron le Despenser (1308–1349), Lord of Glamorgan, was the eldest son and heir of Hugh Despenser the Younger and grandson of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester. His father and grandfather were both executed in 1326. His mother was Eleanor de Clare, "suo jure" Lord of Glamorgan, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford and Joan of Acre. Through his mother, Hugh was a great grandson of King Edward I. He married Elizabeth Montague (d.1359), and both are buried in Tewkesbury Abbey, Gloucestershire, which abbey was founded by Robert Fitzhamon (d.1107), the first Norman feudal baron of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan.

By 1182 he had advanced to the post of" logothetes tou dromou", but was dismissed, blinded( apparently only in one eye), and banished to Russia when Andronikos I Komnenos( r. 1182–1185) took power. He returned to Constantinople and was again" logothetes tou dromou" under Isaac II Angelos( r. 1185 – 1195), and remained active at court under his brother- in- law Alexios III. After the Fourth Crusade he fled to the Empire of Nicaea, established by his nephew Theodore I Laskaris, who in 1209/ 10 sent him on an embassy to the King of Armenian Cilicia, Leo I. Alexios III Angelos (1211) was Byzantine Emperor from March 1195 to July 17/18, 1203. A member of the extended imperial family, Alexios came to throne after deposing, blinding, and imprisoning his younger brother Isaac II Angelos. The most significant event of his reign was the attack of the Fourth Crusade on Constantinople in 1203, on behalf of Alexios IV Angelos. Alexios III took over the defense of the city, which he mismanaged, then fled the city at night with one of his three daughters. From Adrianople, and then Mosynopolis, he unsuccessfully attempted to rally his supporters, only to end up a captive of Marquis Boniface of Montferrat.

Robert Paul Smith( April 16, 1915 – January 30, 1977) was an American author, most famous for his classic evocation of childhood," Where Did You Go? Out. What Did You Do? Nothing". Spencer Bonaventure Tracy (April 5, 1900 – June 10, 1967) was an American actor, noted for his natural performing style and versatility. One of the major stars of Hollywood's Golden Age, Tracy won two Academy Awards for Best Actor from nine nominations, sharing the record for nominations in the category with Laurence Olivier. Tracy first discovered his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He spent seven years in the theatre, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in "The Last Mile" caught the attention of Hollywood. After a successful film debut in John Ford's "Up the River" starring Tracy and Humphrey Bogart, he was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation. His five years with Fox featured one acting tour de force after another that were usually ignored at the box office, and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films, almost all of them starring Tracy as the leading man. None of them were hits although "The Power and the Glory" (1933) features arguably his most acclaimed performance in retrospect. In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, at the time Hollywood's most prestigious studio.

**Text:** In 1935, Tracy joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, at the time Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished with a series of hit films, and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for "Captains Courageous" and "Boys Town". He made three smash hit films supporting Clark Gable, the studio's principal leading man, firmly fixing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team in the public imagination. By the 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in "Woman of the Year", beginning another popular partnership that produced nine movies over 25 years. Tracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against severe alcoholism and guilt over his son's deafness. Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s, but never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" in 1967, completed just 17 days before his death. During his career, Tracy appeared in 75 films and developed a reputation among his peers as one of the screen's greatest actors. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Tracy as the 9th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema.

**Text:** ** John (died 1238/41) was the Lord of Caesarea from 1229 and an important figure in the kingdoms of Cyprus and Jerusalem. He was the only son of Walter III of Caesarea and Marguerite d'Ibelin, daughter of Balian of Ibelin. He was often called "the young lord of Caesarea" throughout his life to distinguish him from his father, who had been called "the old lord of Caesarea". Margaret( floruit 1249 – 55) was the Lady of Caesarea. She was the eldest daughter and heiress of John of Caesarea and Alice de Montaigu, and both of her parents came from the upper echelons of the nobility of Outremer. Margaret was the second lady to inherit Caesarea, after her great- grandmother Juliana. Blanche of Lancaster (25 March 1342 – 12 September 1368) was a member of the English royal House of Plantagenet and the daughter of the kingdom's wealthiest and most powerful peer, Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. She was the first wife of John of Gaunt, the mother of King Henry IV, and the grandmother of King Henry V of England. Walter III (French: "Gautier"), sometimes called Walter de Brisebarre or Walter Grenier (bef. 1180 – 24 June 1229), was the Constable of the Kingdom of Cyprus from 1206 and Lord of Caesarea in the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1216. He was the eldest son of Juliana Grenier, Lady of Caesarea, and Guy de Brisebarre. Since he was witnessing royal charters by 1195, he must have been born no later than 1180.

**Text:** Since he was witnessing royal charters by 1195, he must have been born no later than 1180. In the 1220s he was generally referred to as "the old lord of Caesarea", although probably only in his fifties. He took part in two Crusades and in two civil wars on the side of the House of Ibelin. As a young man, Walter was frequently in attendance at the royal court. He witnessed charters of Henry I in 1195–96, Amalric II in 1198, and the regent John of Ibelin in 1206. On an act of Amalric's he is term "lord of Caesarea", although his mother was still living, as was her second husband, Aymar de Lairon, who subscribed as "lord of Caesarea" to the same charter of John of Ibelin witnessed by Walter. In 1200 and 1206 he was a witness on charters of his mother and Aymar. Hannah Arnold, also known as Hannah Waterman King, was the grandmother of Benedict Arnolds children. John Aleman( died after 1264) was the Lord of Caesarea( as John II) in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, exercising this right through his wife, Margaret, from at least 1243 until his death. He was the son of Garnier l' Aleman and Pavie de Gibelet, and the older brother of Hugh Aleman. John was active politically and militarily, although less influential than the previous lords of Caesarea had been. His maternal grandmother was Stephanie of Milly. The first reference to John as lord of Caesarea comes in the" Assizes of Jerusalem" of John of Ibelin.

**Text:** His maternal grandmother was Stephanie of Milly. The first reference to John as lord of Caesarea comes in the" Assizes of Jerusalem" of John of Ibelin. Therein John writes that his cousin, the lord of Caesarea, refused the bailliage( regency) of the kingdom in 1243, and instead the" Haute Cour" gave it to Queen Alice of Cyprus. Since his father- in- law, Lord John of Caesarea, was dead, this is probably a reference to Aleman. In April 1249 he and his wife sold six" casalia" near Acre to the Teutonic Knights. This included two — Seisor and Mergelcolon and Gedin—that he had inherited from his mother, and Beit Jann and Nahf. In 1253 they sold Al- Damun( and several villages in the vicinity) near Acre to the Hospitallers for 12,000 besants. In 1255 they also sold the Hospitallers everything they owned in Acre as well as the" casalia" of Chasteillon and Rout. On this occasion they were accepted into the lay confraternity of the order as" confrater" and" consoror". Some of the money from the sales to the Hospitallers was used to pay the dower of John's brother Hugh's wife, Isabelle de Tenremonde, of the family of the lords of Adelon. She confirmed the payment of part of her dower in an act of 1259. In 1254, after Louis IX of France and the Seventh Crusade had departed, John and some other barons of the kingdom wrote a letter to Henry III of England requesting aid.

He is referred to in the letter as" John Asa, great lord of CaesareaJohannes Asa magnus dominus Caesareae"). In 1257 John approved and confirmed a treaty made by the bailiff John of Arsuf with the citizens of trading city of Ancona. He does not appear again in contemporary records, but was still alive as late as 1264, when his son Hugh, the" heir of Caesarea", was killed in a fall from his horse. His second son, Nicholas, succeeded him. According to the" Lignages d' Outremer", John and Margaret had a third son named Thomas. John may have been alive when Sultan Baibars of Egypt conquered Caesarea for the last time in 1265. If so, he must have fled to Cyprus, where the subsequent lords of Caesarea resided. Tjuyu( sometimes transliterated as Thuya or Thuyu) was an Egyptian noblewoman and the mother of queen Tiye, and the wife of Yuya. She is the grandmother of Akhenaten, and great grandmother of Tutankhamun. Hubba bint Hulail was the grandmother of Hashim ibn' Abd Manaf, thus the great- great- great- grandmother of the Islamic" Nabī"( Prophet) Muhammad ibn Abdullah.

**Text:** ** Dorothy Karolyn Granger( November 21, 1911 – January 4, 1995) was an American actress best known for her roles in short subject comedies in Hollywood. She was also the stepmother of film maker and former record producer Anthony J. Hilder. Birger Brosa (Old Norse: "Birgir Brósa" where "Brósa" means "smiling"), jarl of Sweden 1174–1202, d. 9 January 1202 on Visingsö, was a son of Bengt Snivil and a member of the powerful House of Bjälbo. In the medieval texts he is either called the "jarl of the Swedes" or the "jarl of the Swedes and the Geats". Birger was appointed to the position of jarl during the reign of Knut Eriksson. He maintained the position during Knut's successor Sverker II until his death in 1202. Before 1170, Birger was married to Brigida Haraldsdotter, the daughter of the Norwegian king Harald Gille. She had formerly been married to the Danish pretender Magnus Henriksson, who had briefly ruled in Uppsala 1160–1161. Birger appears to have maintained peace in Sweden during the civil wars that ravaged Denmark and Norway. Many of the pretenders in these kingdoms sought refuge with Birger. Among them were the Birkebeiner chieftains Eystein Meyla and Sverre Sigurdsson who were kinsmen of Brigida Haraldsdotter. Birger's son Philippus was in the service of King Sverre and died as his Earl in 1200.

May Green Hinckley( May 1, 1881 – May 2, 1943) was the third general president of the Primary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints( LDS Church) from 1940 until her death. She was the stepmother of Gordon B. Hinckley, fifteenth president of the LDS Church. Knut Birgersson (Old Norse: " Knútr jarl Birgisson", died 1208) was Riksjarl of Sweden. He was the eldest surviving son of Riksjarl Birger Brosa and a member of the powerful House of Bjälbo. Knut Birgersson was apparently elevated to the office of Riksjarl during the last years of the reign of King Sverker II of Sweden. This was despite the fact that Sverker had named his infant son Johan Sverkersson as riksjarl following the death of Jarl Birger Brosa, in an attempt to confirm Johan as his royal successor and to diminish the power of highest nobility by effectively abolishing the position of riksjarl, so no adult noble could occupy it. Johan Sverkersson was the nephew of Knut Birgersson, being born of his sister . Sources are silent how and why Knut became jarl in Johan's lifetime, but either he got it as acompromise out of King Sverker, or Sverker actually needed an effective Riksjarl to his side. According to one source, Jarl Knut was married to daughter of King Canute I of Sweden, named Sigrid Knutsdotter. The same source states that Knut's son lord was born of Sigrid.

He directed 149 silent films between 1907 and 1926. He was born in Del Norte, Colorado, and died in Hollywood, California. Searley is best remembered for directing the Thomas Edison version of "Frankenstein" in 1910. He reportedly referred to himself as "the first motion picture director", which was not accurate. He worked for a while at Edison's studio, then started his own production company, being quite successful financially, although most of his films are little known today. When critics began to regard the films of his day to be immoral, Searley became one of the founding members of the MPDA (Motion Picture Directors Association) which sought to give filmmakers who advocated good taste the power of self-censorship. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

**Text:** Like his colleagues and contemporaries Jean- Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, Chabrol was a critic for the influential film magazine" Cahiers du cinéma" before beginning his career as a film maker. Chabrol's career began with" Le Beau Serge"( 1958), inspired by Hitchcock's" Shadow of a Doubt"( 1943). Thrillers became something of a trademark for Chabrol, with an approach characterized by a distanced objectivity. This is especially apparent in" Les Biches"( 1968)," La Femme infidèle"( 1969), and" Le Boucher"( 1970) – all featuring Stéphane Audran, who was his wife at the time. Sometimes characterized as a" mainstream" New Wave director, Chabrol remained prolific and popular throughout his half- century career. In 1978, he cast Isabelle Huppert as the lead in" Violette Nozière". On the strength of that effort, the pair went on to others including the successful" Madame Bovary"( 1991) and" La Cérémonie"( 1996). Film critic John Russell Taylor has stated that" there are few directors whose films are more difficult to explain or evoke on paper, if only because so much of the overall effect turns on Chabrol's sheer hedonistic relish for the medium ... Some of his films become almost private jokes, made to amuse himself." James Monaco has called Chabrol" the craftsman par excellence of the New Wave, and his variations upon a theme give us an understanding of the explicitness and precision of the language of the film that we do n't get from the more varied experiments in genre of Truffaut or Godard."

**Text:** ** Luis Fernández de la Vega( 1601 – 1675 in Gijón) was a Spanish sculptor and carver. He was born in Asturias, but began working in Valladolid. Once he returned to Asturias he never left. Elvira Fernández de Córdoba y Manrique( born c. 1500, died 1524) was a Spanish noblewoman, the only surviving daughter of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba( d. 1515), a Spanish general involved with the Italian Wars and viceroy of Naples from 1503 to 1507, and his second wife Maria Manrique de Lara y Espinoza( d. 1527). In 1518 she married a cousin, Luis Fernández de Córdoba. Elvira died quite young in childbirth in 1524, and her husband shortly after, in 1526, on campaign in Italy. She is of some importance for the genealogy of the Grandees of Spain as she inherited the ducal titles created for her father by the Catholic Monarchs. She had four children, Gonzalo( 1520 – 1578), Francisca( d. 1597), Beatriz and María. Her titles passed to Gonzalo, then to Francisca, and then to the son of Beatriz, Antonio Fernández de Córdoba y Cardona( 1550 – 1606). José María Fernández de Córdoba y Rojas (also José de Córdoba) (6 April 1774 in San Fernando, Cádiz – 15 December 1810 in Potosí), was a Spanish military who played an important role in the early stages of the Argentine War of Independence.

He ruled from 1374 to 1375. Leo was described as" Leo V, King of Armenia" on his own personal seal, and as" Leo of Lusignan the Fifth" in the Middle French inscription on his cenotaph:. Fred H. Frank was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly who lived in Appleton. Justin( century) was a Latin writer who lived under the Roman Empire. Michael Glatthaar( born 3 May 1953) is a German scholar of the Middle Ages, specializing in the documents of the Carolingians and the study of Saint Boniface. A student of Hubert Mordek, he is the author of" Bonifatius und das Sakrileg"( 2004), a study of the saint's influence on the concept of sacrilege in the 8th- century church and afterward. In his study he identifies a number of" sententiae" in a Wurzburg manuscript( an important witness for the Collectio canonum Hibernensis) as connected to Boniface, proposing the title" Sententiae Bonifantianae Wirceburgensis" for the fifty- four" capitula" and chapter headings in the manuscript. He has argued for the authenticity of the 716 capitulary of Pope Gregory II which invested three papal legates with the organization of the church in Bavaria, and for its close connection to Boniface's sphere of influence. With Hubert Mordek and Klaus Zechiel- Eckes he is the editor of the" Admonitio generalis", an important Carolingian document.

Levon Ashotovich Grigorian ( 7 September 1947 – 29 November 1975), was a Soviet Armenian chess player and son of the poet Ashot Grashi. He won Armenian Chess Championships in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972 and Uzbekistani Chess Championships in 1974 and 1975. Grigorian was born in Yerevan, Armenia and died in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. His brother Karen Grigorian was a chess International Master. Lévon Sayan or Levon Sanosyan( born December 17, 1934) is a French- Armenian impresario and producer, as well as an operatic tenor. Hubert Mordek( 8 May 1939, Namslau- 17 March 2006, Karlsbad-Langensteinbach) was a German historian. Maximus of Tyre( fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic. His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really an Eclectic and one of the precursors of Neoplatonism. R. Charlton, who lived in the early nineteenth century, was a Tyneside poet/ songwriter.

**Text:** ** Ramiro Sánchez of Monzón (1070–1129/1130) was a noble kinsman of the kings of Navarre. In 1104 he was "tenente" of Urroz, of Monzón between 1104 and 1116, probably of Tudela in 1117 and from 1122 to 1129 in Erro. His father was Sancho Garcés, an illegitimate son of king García Sánchez III of Navarre. His mother was Constance, whose parentage has been subject to recent speculation - associated with the lords of Marañón in traditional sources, she has lately been suggested to have been daughter of queen Estefanía, King García's wife, and hence stepsister of her husband. With the fall of his uncle, king Sancho IV of Navarre, the kingdom was divided between Castile and Aragon, and the royal family parceled out between the two. Ramiro was thus raised at the Aragonese court, and was lord of Monzón, in which he was succeeded by his eldest son, the future king García Ramírez of Navarre. Around 1098, Ramiro was married to Cristina Rodríguez daughter of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar. Their children were: Maria Thins( c. 1593 – 27 December 1680) was the mother- in- law of Johannes Vermeer and a member of the Gouda Thins family. Eldon Howard was a British screenwriter. She was the mother- in- law of Edward J. Danziger and wrote a number of the screenplays for films by his company Danziger Productions.

**Text:** Ansur, Assur, or Asur Fernández( died 947/50) was a powerful Castilian nobleman and military leader in the Kingdom of León during the reign of Ramiro II. He was the first Count of Monzón, probably from before 939, certainly by 943, and he was Count of Castile in 943–45 in opposition to the deposed Fernán González. His family was known as the Banu Ansur(" Banu Anshur") or Ansúrez( Assuriz). The earliest reference to Ansur is found in a document dated 4 March 921, wherein he is named with his parents Fernando Ansúrez and Muniadonna in a donation in the vicinity of Burgos to San Pedro de Cardeña. His father is not mentioned after 929, but the date of his death is unknown. The leader of the Banu Ansúrez who allied with the Banu Gómez in rebellion against Ramiro in favour of his abdicated brother Alfonso IV in the spring of 932 may have already been Ansur. If so, he was already a count by that time. According to the" Anales castellanos primeros", he participated in the Battle of Simancas in 939, where he is one of only two participating counts named, the other being Fernán González of Castile. This indication of his importance and his high rank may also indicate that by then the county of Monzón had already been created by Ramiro II for him. In July 941 Ramiro associated the counts of the Banu Ansúrez and Gómez families as well as Fernán González and Sancho Garcés II of Pamplona with him in a peace treaty signed with the Caliphate of Córdoba.

**Text:** Despite that Ansur bore the title" count" as early as 939, the earliest direct reference to the county of Monzón is from a diploma of 26 December 943, which reads" regnante Ranimiro in Obeto et in Legione et comite Assur Fredinandiz in Montson"( Ramiro reigning in Oviedo and León and Count Ansur Fernández in Monzón). By this act Ansur, his wife Guntroda, and their children — Fernando, Oveco, Muño, Nuño, Gutierre, Gonzalo, and Teresa—donated the village of Fuente Adrada near Sacramenia to the monastery of San Pedro de Cardeña. The gift was confirmed by a" Domna Toda", who signs right after the king. This may have been Toda of Navarre. A charter dated 1 August 937 refers to" Assuri dominans Menduniae"( Ansur ruling" Mendunia", a corruption of Monzón), but there appears to be an error in the dating clause; the correct date is probably 1 March 947. After Ramiro deposed Fernán González in Castile, he appointed his own son, the future Sancho I, as count with Ansur acting as his" regent". By May 944 Sancho was in Burgos. There are four surviving charters from Ansur's brief reign in Castile; the earliest from November 943. The latest is dated to 1 December 945, though according to other sources Fernán González was reinstated in Castile on 22 April that year. Nonetheless, the reinstated Fernán signed royal documents below Ansur, indicating a reversal of rank. Ansur's only known daughter, Teresa, married Ramiro II's son Sancho I and was the mother of Ramiro III.

**Text:** ** The film was released in Japan on 10 October 2009. Drive, He Said is a 1971 American motion picture released by Columbia Pictures. It is one of the lesser- known works in the influential group of" New Hollywood" films of the late 1960s and early 1970s made by independent production house Raybert Productions(" The MonkeesEasy Rider") and its successor, BBS Productions. Based upon the 1964 novel of the same title by Jeremy Larner, the film, which stars William Tepper, is notable as the directorial debut of Jack Nicholson( who also wrote the screenplay) following his breakthrough as an actor in" Easy Rider"( 1969) and" Five Easy Pieces"( 1970). Although it was coolly received at the time, and has subsequently faded into obscurity, the production brought together many significant Hollywood names. Director of photography Bill Butler gained renown for his later work on classic films such as Steven Spielberg's" Jaws", Francis Ford Coppola's" The Conversation", and" One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Original music was composed by David Shire( then married to Coppola's sister, Talia) and the screenplay included uncredited contributions from future director Terence Malick. It starred several of Nicholson's friends and frequent screen collaborators in leading roles – Karen Black, Bruce Dern, Robert Towne and Henry Jaglom( although Towne and Jaglom became better known as screenwriter and director, respectively). Several younger actors who became familiar TV faces in later years were also featured in small supporting roles, including David Ogden Stiers(" M* A* S*H"), Cindy Williams(" Laverne& Shirley") and Michael Warren(" Hill Street Blues"), who( like Tepper) was also a former collegiate basketball player.

**Text:** It was filmed on the campus of the University of Oregon and other locations in Eugene, Oregon. The film is also notable for its then- controversial use of profanity, its depictions of sex and drug use, and for several scenes of male frontal nudity, including a locker- room shower scene, and the mental breakdown scene in which Gabriel( Margotta) is shown frontally nude, which led to an attempt by the censor to give the film an X rating. The title comes from the poem" I Know A Man" by Robert Creeley, which a character recites in the opening scene. It also serves as a cryptic reference to basketball, the movie's dominant milieu.

Because of this massive output—he would sometimes direct more than 20 films in a single year —he has been called the most prolific director of the sound era. Many of Newfield's films were made for PRC Pictures. This was a film production company headed by his brother Sigmund Neufeld.

He was born, about 1430, into the influential Debno noble family; he was the son of Marshal of the Kingdom of Poland Jan Oleśnicki, and the nephew of Zbigniew Cardinal Oleśnicki of Kraków During the absence of King Casimir IV Jagiellon he was deputized in several state matters including dealing with the Prussians; however, by the end of Casimirs reign their relationship had soured, probably due to a rivalry with Fryderyk Jagiellończyk, the Bishop of Kraków and Casimir's relative. After the death of Casimir, he was a strong supporter for the election of Janusz III of Masovia to be the new king.

**Text:** On 17 January 1521, Sophia and her entourage went to Hungary, where in February there was a formal marriage. The couple had three children: Anna, Stephen and Klara; however, other sources claim that Klara was the couple's only child. Klara was engaged to Carl, Duke of Münsterberg, but died in 1535, before the marriage took place. After the death of Stephen in 1530, Sophia was married to Croatian magnate Louis Pekry. Sophia's second marriage was childless. She then died sometime before 11 March 1543. Sophia had three siblings: Stanislaus I of Masovia, Janusz III of Masovia and Anna of Masovia, both her brothers died childless and so Anna and Sophia were the last Masovian Piasts. Soon after Janusz's death, the Duchy of Masovia was annexed into the kingdom of Poland, despite resistance from some of the Masovian nobility. They tried to retain their independence and argued that the Duchy should be inherited by the female relatives( such as Anna or Sophia). The Polish king refused to recognize their demands. Anna was made titular Duchess of Masovia. Margaret of Masovia( before 1358 – 14 May 1388/4 April 1396) was Duchess of Pomerania and Brzeg, by her marriages to Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania and then to Henryk VIII with a Scar. She was a member of the House of Piast. Margaret was a daughter of Siemowit III of Masovia and his wife Euphemia of Opawa. Her paternal grandparents were Trojden I of Masovia and his wife Maria, daughter of Yuri I of Galicia and Euphemia of Kuyavia.

**Text:** ** Sermon of Zaynab bint Ali in the court of Yazid are the statements made by Zaynab bint Ali in the presence of Yazid I in the aftermath of the Battle of Karbala when the captive family members of Muhammad, prophet of Islam, and the heads of those murdered were moved to the Levant (it is equivalent to the historical region of Syria) by the forces of YazidI. Zaynab delivered a defiant sermon in the court of Yazid in which she humiliated Yazid and exposed his army's atrocities while honoring the Ahl al-Bayt and those killed in Karbala and expounding upon the eternal consequences of the battle. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.

**Text:** This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase" jus soli". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as" jus sanguinis"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's" country of birth". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's" place of birth" or" nationality at birth".

Yazid ibn Khalid al- Qasri was a son of the famed Khalid al- Qasri, the longtime( 724–738) governor of Iraq for the Umayyads. Due to his father's imprisonment, torture, and death at the hands of al- Walid II's governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al- Thaqafi, during the Third Fitna he sided with Yazid III, apparently serving as his" sahib al- shurta". Following Yazid III's death, he is reported as the executioner of the two underage sons of al- Walid II, and then participated in the unsuccessful revolt of the Syrians in 745 against Marwan II. He besieged Damascus, but the city was relieved by Marwan II, and Yazid was executed by the latter.

Motherland may also refer to: Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (circa 674 – 23 February 715), commonly known as al-Walid I , was the sixth Umayyad caliph, ruling from October 705 until his death. Al-Walid was the eldest son of his predecessor Caliph Abd al-Malik . While still a prince, he led annual raids against the Byzantines in 695–698 and built or restored fortifications along the Syrian Desert route to Mecca. He became the heir apparent after the death of Abd al-Malik's brother and designated successor, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, in 704. Al-Walid largely continued his father's policies of centralization and expansion, and heavily depended on al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, his father's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. During his reign, Umayyad armies conquered the Maghreb, Hispania, Sind and Transoxiana, expanding the Caliphate to its largest territorial extent. War spoils from the conquests allowed al-Walid to finance public works of great magnitude, including the Great Mosque of Damascus, the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. He was the first caliph to institute programs for social welfare, aiding the poor and handicapped in Syria. Though it is difficult to ascertain al-Walid's direct role in the affairs of his caliphate, his reign was marked by domestic peace and prosperity and likely represented the peak of Umayyad power.

**Text:** The Lass from the Stormy Croft is a 1917 Swedish drama film directed by Victor Sjöström, based on the 1908 novella with the same title by Selma Lagerlöf. It was the first in a series of successful Lagerlöf adaptions by Sjöström, made possible by a deal between Lagerlöf and A- B Svenska Biografteatern( later AB Svensk Filmindustri) to adapt at least one Lagerlöf novel each year. Lagerlöf had for many years denied any proposal to let her novels be adapted for film, but after seeing Sjöström's" Terje Vigen" she finally decided to give her consent. It was originally released in the US as" The Girl from the March Croft" and the UK as" The Woman He Chose". However it is today generally referred to as" The Lass from the Stormy Croft", which is closer to the original Swedish title. Six other adaptions of the same novel have been made, a German and a Turkish in 1935, a Finnish in 1940, another Swedish in 1947, a Danish(" Husmandstøsen") in 1952 and another German in 1958.

**Text:** He remains a controversial personality in Italy due to his blunt style and the focus of some of his works on taboo sexual matters. He was an established major figure in European literature and cinematic arts. His murder prompted an outcry in Italy and its circumstances continue to be a matter of heated debate. High Test Girls is a 1980 Swiss pornographic film co-written and directed by Erwin C. Dietrich. It stars Brigitte Lahaie, Jane Baker, Lynn Monteil, France Lomay, Flore Sollier and Élodie Delage. The film is a sequel to" Sechs Schwedinnen im Pensionat". Erwin C. Dietrich (4 October 1930 in Glarus – 15 March 2018 in Zurich) was a Swiss film director, producer and actor, often regarded as one of the most influential cinematographers in Switzerland. He quit his dream of becoming an actor rather early on and instead started focusing on his sense for artistic trends appealing to audiences. Starting in 1955 he began producing movies, first with his company "Urania": The films "The Man in the Black Derby" and "The Model Husband" starring Swiss comedian Walter Roderer turned into big successes. At around the time where the "Edgar Wallace" thrillers became popular in Germany, Erwin brought "Nylon Noose" and "The Strangler of the Tower" starring German movie stars, such as Dietmar Schönherr, to the cinemas. He achieved commercial success with his directorial debut in 1968, the film adaptation of Guy de Maupassant's novel "The Colonel's Nieces". Over 45 more films followed until 1980.

Movies that he either directed or produced, often using pseudonyms such "Michael Thomas" or "Manfred Gregor" under the umbrella of newly "Elite-Film" (later: "Ascot Film GmbH"). Most of these movies came to life in a very informal environment, with a small crew in his studios in Rümlang, where the set pieces were rearranged on the fly. Some highlights can be found, in particular those starring Ingrid Steeger or French erotic star number one, Brigitte Lahaie. These movies have meanwhile advanced to cult status and are long running favorites at movie festivals and in home cinemas worldwide. Erwin often mentioned his favorite movie to be his remake of THE COLONEL’S NIECES, starring Brigitte Lahaie. Jess Franco, who for years has been ridiculed as a cheap grunge director and yet in the end received the "Goya" award, the Spanish Oscar, made 17 films in this work period with Erwin C. Dietrich and called it the most productive and pleasant period of his career. Film such as "Love Letters of a Portuguese Nun" or "Jack the Ripper" with performances by Klaus Kinski were praised by industry friends and fans such as Joe Dante and Quentin Tarantino who once called Erwin the "Swiss Roger Corman". "The Story of Piera" produced by him and directed by Marco Ferreri, starring Isabelle Huppert and Marcello Mastroianni, may not have been a commercially comparable success to Erwin's other productions but it turned into a huge hit at the festivals, and Hanna Schygulla received the "Golden Palm" in Cannes for her performance.

**Text:** The action film "The Wild Geese" which he co-produced with Euan Lloyd garnered him international recognition. The cast included Richard Harris, Roger Moore, Richard Burton, and Hardy Krüger did its share; the movie was seen by 4 million movie-goers in Germany alone and advanced to become a huge blockbuster in 1978, ultimately winning the "Goldene Leinwand" award. Following this success Erwin launched similar additional big productions on the big screen, including "Escape to Athena" and "The Sea Wolves". Convinced by their success Erwin began production along with business partner Peter Baumgartner (and Peter's dubbing studios in Berlin, "Cinephon") three action spectacles to be shot in the Philippines. Emphasized by a gigantic marketing campaign (including an ecstatic Klaus Kinski dominating the promo tour) he released in the mid-80s the "mercenary trilogy" consisting of , "Commando Leopard" and "The Commander" on the big screen, the cast included Klaus Kinski, Ernest Borgnine, and Lee Van Cleef. During that time he also opened up the first cinema-multiplex in Switzerland called "Capitol". Later he expanded it with the "Cinemax". In the beginning of the 1990s, after the dance film "Dance Academy 2: Dance to Win", the two Swiss comedies "Ein Schweizer Names Notzli" and "Der Doppelte Notzli", Deitrich retired from the active movie production business and committed himself to his movie distribution company "Ascot-Elite" which was taken over by his children. Hartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 – 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.

**Text:** He was the fourth child (and second son) of Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry and his wife Frances Anne Vane, Marchioness of Londonderry. In December 1852, he was elected at a by-election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the City of Durham, but the election was overturned on petition the next year. In 1854 he was elected unopposed to the House of Commons as MP for North Durham after the death of his father, filling the seat vacated by his elder brother George Vane-Tempest, Viscount Seaham, who succeeded to the peerage as Earl Vane. He held the seat until his death in 1864, aged 38. During the enthusiasm for the Volunteer Movement in 1859–60, although his brothers were connected with the 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps formed at the family's Seaham Colliery, Lord Adolphus raised and commanded an infantry corps, the Sunderland Rifles. According to Anne Isba, author and Victorian Studies scholar, Vane was "notoriously unstable" and was "described by Queen Victoria as having 'a natural tendency to madness.' Vane, who on one occasion violently attacked his wife and infant son, died four years later during a struggle with four keepers." Charles William Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry (born Charles William Stewart; 1778–1854) was an Irish soldier in the British army, a politician, and a nobleman. As a soldier he fought in the French Revolutionary Wars, in the suppression of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and in the Napoleonic wars. He excelled as a cavalry commander on the Iberian Peninsula under John Moore and Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington).

**Text:** Film critic Roger Ebert described him as" one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors." Lumet was also known as an" actor's director," having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than" any other director." Sean Connery, who acted in five of his films, considered him one of his favorite directors, and one who had that" vision thing." A member of the maiden cohort of New York's Actors Studio, Lumet began his directorial career in Off- Broadway productions, then became a highly efficient TV director. His first movie," 12 Angry Men"( 1957), was a courtroom drama centered on a tense jury deliberation. Lumet subsequently divided his energies among political and social drama films, as well as adaptations of literary plays and novels, big stylish stories, New York- based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including" Serpico" and" Prince of the City". As a result of directing" 12 Angry Men", he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies. In 2005 Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his" brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture." Two years later he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama" Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"( 2007). A few months after Lumet's death in April 2011, a retrospective celebration of his work was held at New York's Lincoln Center with numerous speakers and film stars. In 2015 Nancy Buirski directed" By Sidney Lumet", a documentary about his career, and in January 2017 PBS devoted its" American Masters" series to Lumet's life as a director.

**Text:** The" Heimskringla" saga states that Eystein Glumra was the father of Rognvald Eysteinsson and Sigurd Eysteinsson:" The first earl in the Orkney Islands was called Sigurd, who was a son of Eystein Glumra, and brother of Ragnvald earl of More. After Sigurd, his son Guthorm was earl for one year. After him Torf- Einar, a son of Ragnvald, took the earldom, and was long earl, and was a man of great power". According to the" Orkneyinga Saga", Eystein Glumra was the son of Ivar the jarl of Uplanders and grandson of Halfdan the Old. " Orkneyinga Saga" also named Eystein Glumra as the father of Rognvald Eysteinsson:" Heiti, Gorr ’s son, was father of Sveiði the sea-king,[ who was] the father of Halfdan the old,[ who was] the father of Ivar the Uplanders ’ earl,[ who was] the father of Eystein the noisy,[ who was] the father of earl Rognvald the mighty and wise in council". Linnea Hartsuyker's books The Half- drowned King and The Sea Queen cover the lives of Eystein's children. James I the Conqueror (2 February 1208 – 27 July 1276) was King of Aragon, Count of Barcelona, and Lord of Montpellier from 1213 to 1276; King of Majorca from 1231 to 1276; and Valencia from 1238 to 1276.

**Text:** His long reign—the longest of any Iberian monarch—saw the expansion of the House of Aragon and House of Barcelona in three directions: Languedoc to the north, the Balearic Islands to the southeast, and Valencia to the south. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he wrested the County of Barcelona from nominal French suzerainty and integrated it into his crown. He renounced northward expansion and taking back the once Catalan territories in Occitania and vassal counties loyal to the County of Barcelona, lands that were lost by his father Peter II of Aragon in the Battle of Muret during the Albigensian Crusade and annexed by the Kingdom of France, and then decided to turn south. His great part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia. One of the main reasons for this formal renunciation of most of the once Catalan territories in Languedoc and Occitania and any expansion into them is the fact that he was raised by the Knights Templar crusaders, who had defeated his father fighting for the Pope alongside the French, so it was effectively forbidden for him to try to maintain the traditional influence of the Count of Barcelona that previously existed in Occitania and Languedoc. As a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the European kings. James compiled the "Llibre del Consolat de Mar", which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragonese supremacy in the western Mediterranean. He was an important figure in the development of the Catalan language, sponsoring Catalan literature and writing a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the "Llibre dels fets". John Templeton( 1766–1825) was an early Irish naturalist and botanist.

Day and Night and its variants may refer to: A day and night camera is a security camera that can see the picture during the day hours, when there is enough sunlight, and during the night in total darkness or minimum illumination. A day and night camera has special lenses that allow infrared emission produced by infrared LEDs and reflected from objects to go through and reach a CCD or CMOS chip inside the camera. As a result, the end user can see picture in total darkness at the distance of infrared emission produced by LEDs. A day and night camera can have infrared LEDs mounted on its housing or can accept the emission, produced by an infrared turret. Day and night cameras often have modifications in their digital signal processor( DSP) that compensates for the difference in illumination between day and night modes.

**Text:** ** Tony Ianzelo, CM, RCA (born June 13, 1935) is a Canadian documentary director and cinematographer. He was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and attended Toronto’s Ryerson Polytechnical School (now Ryerson University). His career at the National Film Board of Canada was characterized by an empathic portrayal of his subjects, and he gained a reputation for compassion and honesty through sensitive films and unobtrusive cinematography. He joined the NFB in 1960 as a camera assistant and, in 1966, made his first film, "Antonio". This short piece, which uses his own father as a subject to explore the themes of family, immigration and alienation, was shown in schools and institutions for three decades after its release. A prolific and innovative artist, he retired in the late 1990s with over one hundred film credits. Best known for his quiet empathy and unobtrusive camera-work, he worked with the NFB program "Challenge for Change", where he used his skills on such films as "Cree Hunters of Mistassini" with Boyce Richardson, and other projects in Canada's Far North. One of the first cinematographers nominated to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, he received numerous awards and commendations, including two Academy Award nominations (both for Best Documentary Short, for "Blackwood" in 1976 and "High Grass Circus" in 1977), as well as the Order of Canada in 2003 for his lifetime contribution to world documentary cinema. In 1986, with Colin Low, he co-directed "Transitions", the first 3D IMAX film, which was shown at the Expo 86 in Vancouver. He is currently retired and living in Montreal. Now Where Did the 7th Company Get To? is a 1973 French- Italian comedy war film directed by Robert Lamoureux.

**Text:** ** Jean- Nicolas or Nicolas Bassenge( 24 November 1758, in Liège – 16 July 1811) was a politician from the Principality of Liège. He was active in the Liège Revolution then the French Revolution. Nicolas Léonard Beker or Nicolas Léonard Becker or Nicolas Léonard Bagert, born 18 January 1770 – died 18 November 1840, joined the French army as a dragoon before the French Revolutionary Wars and rose in rank to become a general officer. In 1800 he married the sister of Louis Desaix, who was killed at the Battle of Marengo. He led an infantry brigade in the 1805 campaign and commanded a dragoon division in 1806 and 1807. In 1809 he became chief of staff to Marshal André Masséna but ran afoul of Emperor Napoleon and was banished from the army for several years. After Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo and the collapse of his regime, the interim French government appointed Beker to guard the ex-emperor. The general behaved correctly during the intrigues surrounding Napoleon before he went into exile at Saint Helena. Nevertheless, he was summarily retired during the Bourbon Restoration and only received the honors due him many years later. Beker is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe. Nicolas About( born 14 July 1947) is a French politician from the centrist MoDem. He was a member of the French Senate and President of the Centrist Union group.

**Text:** ** Franciszek Ksawery Branicki (1730, Barwałd Górny, Poland – 1819 Biała Cerkiew, Russian Empire) was a Polish nobleman, magnate, French count, diplomat, politician, military commander, one of the leaders of the Targowica Confederation and a grand traitor who participated with the Russians in the dismemberment of his nation. He was appointed Great Crown Podstoli in 1764, Ambassador to Berlin in 1765, Master of the Hunt of the Crown in 1766–1773, Artillery General of Lithuania in 1768–1773, Ambassador to Moscow in 1771, Crown Hetman in 1773 and was Great Crown Hetman of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth between 1774 and 1794. In 1774 Stanisław August Poniatowski ceded to him, as mark of his confidence and esteem, the immense estate of Bila Tserkva in the Kiev Oblast. He opposed the reforms of the Great Sejm (1788–1792), and supported the Hetman Party instead. During the Kościuszko Uprising (1794) he was sentenced by the Supreme Criminal Court, "in absentia", to hang for treason, witness his decades long pro-Russian stance and anti-patriotic politics and plotting against the state, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, he escaped the death penalty. Branicki was awarded the Order of the White Eagle in December 1764. He married Aleksandra von Engelhardt, a supposed niece of Prince Potemkin, in 1781 making him the putative son-in-law of Empress Catherine of Russia. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born.

**Text:** The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase" jus soli".

There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's" country of birth". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's" place of birth" or" nationality at birth". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place. In Switzerland, the place of origin( literally" home place" or" citizen place") denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances. " Where Was I?" may refer to: Valley of Death may refer to: Beaulieu- sur- Loire is a commune in the Loiret department in north -central France.

John Ros, 5th Baron Ros of Helmsley, KB (d. 6 August 1393) took a prominent part in the pageantry at the coronation of Richard II. Following the coronation he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath. While on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem he died in Paphos, Cyprus. His body was returned and buried at Rievaulx Abbey. John Ros married, before 22 June 1382, Mary de Percy (12 March 1367 – 25 August 1394), daughter of Henry Percy, 3rd Baron Percy and Joan Orreby; by whom he had no issue. John de Southeray( 1364- 1383) was an illegitimate son of King Edward III of England by his mistress Alice Perrers. He was the oldest of Perrers' three acknowledged illegitimate children by her royal lover. He was knighted in April 1377, alongside the future King Richard II. That same year, he was married to Maud Percy, a daughter of Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy; she divorced him in 1380, claiming she had not consented to the marriage. During the abortive Castilian campaign led by his half- brother the Earl of Cambridge in 1381, John led a contingent of English soldiers. After his troops went unpaid, John led them in a mutiny; he may have been only a figurehead for the mutineers, though, as he( unlike the other conspirators) went unpunished afterwards.

**Text:** Eleanor Fitzalan( c. 1284 – July/ August 1328) was an alleged daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel and his wife Alice of Saluzzo. She became the wife of Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy. Their son was Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy. Standard accounts of the Percy family identify Eleanor as the daughter of the" Earl of Arundel". Arrangements for Eleanor's marriage to Lord Percy are found in the recognizance made in 1300 by Eleanor's father, Richard, Earl of Arundel, for a debt of 2,000 marks which he owed Sir Henry Percy. Eleanor was styled as a" kinswoman" of Edward II on two separate occasions; once in 1318 and again in 1322 presumably by her descent from Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy who was the brother of Edward II's great- grandmother, Beatrice of Savoy. Eleanor's brothers, Edmund and John were also styled as" kinsmen" of the king. Eleanor's identity is further indicated by the presence of the old and new arms of FitzAlan( or Arundel) at her tomb. Henry Percy, 9th Baron Percy of Topcliffe, 2nd Baron Percy of Alnwick (1298–1352) was the son of Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Alnwick, and Eleanor Fitzalan, daughter of Sir Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel, and sister of Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel. Henry was sixteen when his father died, so the Barony was placed in the custody of John de Felton. In 1316 he was granted the lands of Patrick IV, Earl of March, in Northumberland, by King Edward II of England.

Since 1519, his appanages included Volokolamsk and Staritsa. When his elder brother Vasily III ascended the throne, Andrey was just 14. Like his other brothers, he was forbidden to marry until Vasily could produce an heir. This didn't come to pass until 1530, but it was only two years later, when Vasily's second son was born, that Andrey was finally allowed to find himself a wife. Several months later, on February 2, 1533, he married a Gedyminid Princess, Euphrosinia Andreyevna Khovanskaya. Their only child, Vladimir, was born later that year. Next month, however, Vasily died. After 40 days of mourning, Andrey applied to his widow Elena Glinskaya for extension of his demesnes. Elena denied him that favour and Andrey departed for Staritsa in anger. There he heard that his only living brother, Yury Ivanovich, had been taken to prison and died there.

It is only natural that he declined Elena's emphatic invitations to visit Moscow and lived in Staritsa in seclusion for three following years. He built there a fine cathedral, which still stands. In 1537, however, it was rumoured that Andrey was going to escape to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Upon hearing the news, Elena closed the Lithuanian border and dispatched her minion, Prince Obolensky, to seize him. Andrey escaped to Novgorod, where he persuaded local nobility to join his cause. Reluctant to appeal to arms, however, he surrendered to the mercy of Obolensky. At Moscow, he was tried and thrown into prison with all his family. He died several months later and was succeeded in Staritsa by his son Vladimir.

**Text:** Lapidoth is also a Hebrew male given name. Evfrosinia Staritskaia née Khovanskaia (died 1569), was a Russian noblewoman. In 1533, she married Prince Andrey of Staritsa, cousin of Tsar Ivan the Terrible. She was described as ambitious and forceful. She wished for the Staritski family to influence the regency of Ivan IV, and orchestrated a plot to depose the regent Elena Glinskaya. She failed, and was imprisoned with her son Vladimir of Staritsa and her spouse, who died in prison. After the death of regent Elena, Evfrosinia returned to court with her son and successfully influenced the Tsar to return the confiscated lands of her spouse. In 1550, she arranged for her son to marry Evdokia Nagaja, and allied with the Belskii court faction in order to place her son Vladimir on the throne. She created alliances with boyar families by including them in her household in her principality of Staritsa, and equipped the principality with her own army. During the illness of Ivan IV in 1553, she actively pressed the claims of her son to the throne. However, her plot failed as she did not managed to secure support in the Boyar Duma, nor the full cooperation of her son. In response, she herself kept the seal and control of the family principality and refused to give it to her son even as he was no longer a minor. When recovered, Ivan IV himself had Vladimir include a promise in his oath not to protect his mother if she was to "plan harm" against him again. During the Livonian War, Vladmir was honored for his conduct in Battle and won popularity, which made the tsar fear that Evfrosinia would use her son's popularity against him.

**Text:** During the Livonian War, Vladmir was honored for his conduct in Battle and won popularity, which made the tsar fear that Evfrosinia would use her son's popularity against him. In 1563, Evfrosinia was arrested and put on trial for alleged conspiracy and sentenced to live in a convent. She was however allowed to keep her own household in the convent, allowed to make pilgrimage journeys and kept informed of political affairs, and thus the verdict had limited actual effect on her activity. In 1569, Ivan IV again suspected Vladimir to be the object of plots to place him on the throne, orchestrated by his mother: he gave orders that she be executed, which was performed.

**Text:** ** Mona Hopton Bell( 1867- 1940) was a British artist, best known for her portraits of civic figures. She was the grandmother of the painter Jean H. Bell. Hannah Arnold, also known as Hannah Waterman King, was the grandmother of Benedict Arnolds children. Margaret Beauchamp( c. 1410 – before 3 June 1482) was the oldest daughter of Sir John Beauchamp," de jure" 3rd Baron Beauchamp of Bletsoe, and his second wife, Edith Stourton. She was the maternal grandmother of Henry VII. Frederick II (26 December 1194 – 13 December 1250) was King of Sicily from 1198, King of Germany from 1212, King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 and King of Jerusalem from 1225. He was the son of emperor Henry VI of the Hohenstaufen dynasty and of Constance, heiress to the Norman kings of Sicily. His political and cultural ambitions were enormous as he ruled a vast area, beginning with Sicily and stretching through Italy all the way north to Germany. As the Crusades progressed, he acquired control of Jerusalem and styled himself its king. However, the Papacy became his enemy, and it eventually prevailed. Viewing himself as a direct successor to the Roman emperors of antiquity, he was Emperor of the Romans from his papal coronation in 1220 until his death; he was also a claimant to the title of King of the Romans from 1212 and unopposed holder of that monarchy from 1215. As such, he was King of Germany, of Italy, and of Burgundy.

**Text:** As such, he was King of Germany, of Italy, and of Burgundy. At the age of three, he was crowned King of Sicily as a co-ruler with his mother, Constance of Hauteville, the daughter of Roger II of Sicily. His other royal title was King of Jerusalem by virtue of marriage and his connection with the Sixth Crusade. Frequently at war with the papacy, which was hemmed in between Frederick's lands in northern Italy and his Kingdom of Sicily (the "Regno") to the south, he was excommunicated four times and often vilified in pro-papal chronicles of the time and after. Pope Gregory IX went so far as to call him an Antichrist. Speaking six languages (Latin, Sicilian, Middle High German, Langues d'oïl, Greek and Arabic), Frederick was an avid patron of science and the arts. He played a major role in promoting literature through the Sicilian School of poetry. His Sicilian royal court in Palermo, beginning around 1220, saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo-Romance language, Sicilian. The poetry that emanated from the school had a significant influence on literature and on what was to become the modern Italian language. He was also the first king to formally outlaw trial by ordeal, which had come to be viewed as superstitious. After his death his line did not survive, and the House of Hohenstaufen came to an end. Furthermore, the Holy Roman Empire entered a long period of decline from which it did not completely recover until the reign of Charles V, 250 years later. Historian Donald Detwiler wrote: Elizabeth Tudor( 2 July 1492 – 14 September 1495) was the second daughter and fourth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York.

**Text:** Historian Donald Detwiler wrote: Elizabeth Tudor( 2 July 1492 – 14 September 1495) was the second daughter and fourth child of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York. Tjuyu( sometimes transliterated as Thuya or Thuyu) was an Egyptian noblewoman and the mother of queen Tiye, and the wife of Yuya. She is the grandmother of Akhenaten, and great grandmother of Tutankhamun. Meynnart Wewyck or Maynard Vewicke was a Netherlandish painter, active ca. 1502- 1525 in England. Wewyck was employed as an artist at the court of Henry VII of England and, after his death, by his son Henry VIII. He also spent a brief period at the court of James IV of Scotland. Surviving documentation associates Wewyck with portraits of several members of the royal family, and with drawings for the tomb of Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, at Westminster Abbey. New research published in 2019 has identified a portrait of Lady Margaret Beaufort in the Master's Lodge at St John's College, Cambridge as by Wewyck, and also attributes a painting of Henry VII at the Society of Antiquaries of London to his hand. Henry (VII) (1211 – 12 February ? 1242), a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, was King of Sicily from 1212 until 1217 and King of Germany (formally "Rex Romanorum") from 1220 until 1235, as son and co-ruler of Emperor Frederick II. He was the seventh Henry to rule Germany, but in order to avoid confusion with the Luxembourg emperor Henry VII, he is usually numbered Henry (VII).

It tells the story of the last years of the life of the Emperor Napoléon (played by Philippe Torreton), who was imprisoned by the British on St Helena. Napoléon retained a loyal entourage of officers who helped him plot his escape, and evaded the attentions of Major-General Sir Hudson Lowe (Richard E. Grant), the island's overzealous Governor. The film suggests that Napoléon could have escaped to Louisiana, where he died, and that the body exhumed and now at Les Invalides is that of Napoléon's officer Cipriani. The film also suggests that Napoléon and his young new English wife could have attended the ceremony of "Napoléon's" burial in the Invalides.

The" Heimskringla" saga states that Eystein Glumra was the father of Rognvald Eysteinsson and Sigurd Eysteinsson:" The first earl in the Orkney Islands was called Sigurd, who was a son of Eystein Glumra, and brother of Ragnvald earl of More. After Sigurd, his son Guthorm was earl for one year. After him Torf- Einar, a son of Ragnvald, took the earldom, and was long earl, and was a man of great power". According to the" Orkneyinga Saga", Eystein Glumra was the son of Ivar the jarl of Uplanders and grandson of Halfdan the Old. " Orkneyinga Saga" also named Eystein Glumra as the father of Rognvald Eysteinsson:" Heiti, Gorr ’s son, was father of Sveiði the sea-king,[ who was] the father of Halfdan the old,[ who was] the father of Ivar the Uplanders ’ earl,[ who was] the father of Eystein the noisy,[ who was] the father of earl Rognvald the mighty and wise in council". Linnea Hartsuyker's books The Half- drowned King and The Sea Queen cover the lives of Eystein's children. He was the father of Takayama Ukon, and was a Kirishitan.

On his death his lands were divided between his three sons: Jane Wigham( née Smeal; 1801–1888) was a leading Scottish abolitionist. She was the stepmother of Eliza Wigham and the second wife of John Wigham. Stephen (1092/6 – 25 October 1154), often referred to as Stephen of Blois, was King of England from 22 December 1135 to his death. He was Count of Boulogne from 1125 until 1147 and Duke of Normandy from 1135 until 1144. His reign was marked by the Anarchy, a civil war with his cousin and rival, the Empress Matilda, whose son, Henry II, succeeded Stephen as the first of the Angevin kings of England. Stephen was born in the County of Blois in central France; his father, Count Stephen-Henry, died while Stephen was still young, and he was brought up by his mother, Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror. Placed into the court of his uncle, Henry I of England, Stephen rose in prominence and was granted extensive lands. He married Matilda of Boulogne, inheriting additional estates in Kent and Boulogne that made the couple one of the wealthiest in England. Stephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I's son, William Adelin, in the sinking of the "White Ship" in 1120; William's death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge.

**Text:** Stephen narrowly escaped drowning with Henry I's son, William Adelin, in the sinking of the "White Ship" in 1120; William's death left the succession of the English throne open to challenge. When Henry died in 1135, Stephen quickly crossed the English Channel and with the help of his brother Henry, Bishop of Winchester and Abbot of Glastonbury, took the throne, arguing that the preservation of order across the kingdom took priority over his earlier oaths to support the claim of Henry I's daughter, the Empress Matilda. The early years of Stephen's reign were largely successful, despite a series of attacks on his possessions in England and Normandy by David I of Scotland, Welsh rebels, and the Empress Matilda's husband Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou. In 1138, the Empress's half-brother Robert of Gloucester rebelled against Stephen, threatening civil war. Together with his close advisor, Waleran de Beaumont, Stephen took firm steps to defend his rule, including arresting a powerful family of bishops. When the Empress and Robert invaded in 1139, Stephen was unable to crush the revolt rapidly, and it took hold in the south-west of England. Captured at the battle of Lincoln in 1141, he was abandoned by many of his followers and lost control of Normandy. He was freed only after his wife and William of Ypres, one of his military commanders, captured Robert at the Rout of Winchester, but the war dragged on for many years with neither side able to win an advantage. Stephen became increasingly concerned with ensuring that his son Eustace would inherit his throne. The King tried to convince the Church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim; Pope Eugene III refused, and Stephen found himself in a sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy.

**Text:** The King tried to convince the Church to agree to crown Eustace to reinforce his claim; Pope Eugene III refused, and Stephen found himself in a sequence of increasingly bitter arguments with his senior clergy. In 1153 the Empress's son, Henry FitzEmpress, invaded England and built an alliance of powerful regional barons to support his claim for the throne. The two armies met at Wallingford, but neither side's barons were keen to fight another pitched battle. Stephen began to examine a negotiated peace, a process hastened by the sudden death of Eustace. Later in the year Stephen and Henry agreed to the Treaty of Winchester, in which Stephen recognised Henry as his heir in exchange for peace, passing over William, Stephen's second son. Stephen died the following year. Modern historians have extensively debated the extent to which his personality, external events, or the weaknesses in the Norman state contributed to this prolonged period of civil war. Mahaut or Matilda II of Boulogne( also known as" Mathilde Maud de Dammartin"; 1202 – January 1259) was Countess of Boulogne in her own right and Queen of Portugal by marriage to King Afonso III from 1248 until their divorce in 1253. She was the daughter of Ida, Countess of Boulogne and her husband and co-ruler Renaud, Count of Dammartin. She succeeded her mother as Countess of Boulogne in 1216. She was the great- granddaughter of King Stephen of England. Eustace IV (c. 1127–113517 August 1153), Count of Boulogne, was the eldest son of King Stephen of England and Countess Matilda I of Boulogne. When his father seized the English throne on Henry I's death in 1135, he became heir apparent to the English throne.

**Text:** When his father seized the English throne on Henry I's death in 1135, he became heir apparent to the English throne. Upon his mother's death in 1152 he inherited the county of Boulogne and other estates. Eustace was first mentioned in one of his parents' charters dated no later than August 1131. As heir to the English throne in 1137, he did homage for Normandy to Louis VII of France, whose sister, Constance, he subsequently married in 1140 (as a widow she remarried to Count Raymond V of Toulouse). Eustace was knighted in 1147, at which date he was probably from sixteen to eighteen years of age. In 1151 he joined his brother-in-law Louis VII in a raid upon Normandy. This was short-lived, however, when Louis accepted Henry Plantagenet's homage for the Normandy. The following year, he was in France as part of a wider coalition of Henry's enemies, but Henry's control of the duchy remained unshaken. In the later stages of the period known as The Anarchy, Stephen was concerned with cementing Eustace as his heir without question. At a council held in London on 6 April 1152, Stephen induced a small number of barons to pay homage to Eustace as their future king; but the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theobald of Bec, and the other bishops declined to perform the coronation ceremony on the grounds that the Roman curia had declined Stephen's request to use the Capetian custom and crown Eustace in his own lifetime, opting rather they stick to English custom, thus denying Eustace his coronation. After the second siege of Wallingford in July 1153, after Henry had invaded England and attracted widespread support, Stephen was persuaded to agree to terms.

**Text:** After the second siege of Wallingford in July 1153, after Henry had invaded England and attracted widespread support, Stephen was persuaded to agree to terms. This later became known as the Treaty of Winchester. This cemented Henry as Stephen's heir. Eustace withdrew from the court as a result of this, "greatly vexed and angry, because the war, in his opinion, had not reached a proper conclusion". Eustace died suddenly the next year, in early August 1153, struck down (so it was said) by the wrath of God while plundering church lands near Bury St Edmunds. Others believe that Eustace died simply of a broken heart. The death of Eustace was hailed with general satisfaction as opening the possibility of a peaceful settlement between Stephen and his rival, the young Henry of Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, Stephen was "grieved beyond measure by the death of the son whom he hoped would succeed him; he pursued warlike preparations less vigorously, and listened more patiently than usual to the voices of those urging peace." The reputation Eustace left behind was mixed. On the one hand, the "Peterborough Chronicle", not content with voicing this sentiment, gives Eustace a bad character. "He was an evil man and did more harm than good wherever he went; he spoiled the lands and laid thereon heavy taxes." Eustace raided church lands near Peterborough, possibly inciting this hatred from the "Chronicle". He had used threats against the recalcitrant bishops, and in the war against the Angevin party had demanded contributions from religious houses. However, the "Gesta Stephani" describes his courtly manner as a true heir to Stephen able to "meet men on a footing of equality or superiority as the occasion acquired".

**Text:** He was a scion of the Rathore clan. His father was Rao Ganga Ji and his mother was Rani Padmavati of Sirohi. Rao Maldev fought in the Battle of Khanwa as a young prince, the defeat at Khanwa greatly weakened all the Rajput kingdoms in India, but Marwar under Maldev's capable rule turned into a powerful Rajput Kingdom that resisted foreign rule and challenged them for northern supremacy. Maldev refused to ally with either the Sur Empire or the Mughal Empire after Humayun regained control of north India in 1555. This policy was continued by his son and successor Chandrasen Rathore. The Persian historian Firishta calls him as the "most Potent Ruler of Hindustan". Nizamuddin Ahmad in Tabaqat- i-Akbari calls Maldev as the "greatest of the rajas of Hind". According to Abul Fazl- Maldev was the most powerful ruler of the region "both in rank and position and for the number of servants and the extent of his territories."

León Klimovsky always dreamt of doing great mainstream movies but ended up doing commercial exploitation films, but he had no remorse, as cinema was a vocational mandate for him. He retired from directing in 1979, at age 73. In 1995, at age 89, he won the "Honor Award" from the Spanish Film Directors Association. He died the following year in Madrid from a heart attack.

**Text:** ** Christopher Ludwig Morse( born 1935) is an American Christian theologian. He is Dietrich Bonhoeffer Professor of Theology and Ethics at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Gerhard, Count zur Mark( 1378 – 1461) was the de facto ruler of the County of Mark between 1430 and 1461. Dietrich was the third son of Count Adolf III of the Marck and Margaret of Jülich .< br> His father had acquired the County of Cleves in 1368 and given this title to his eldest son Adolf. The second son Dietrich received the title of Count of Mark. When Dietrich fell in battle in 1398, he was succeeded as Count of Mark by his elder brother Adolf. The ambitious Gerhard claimed a part of his father's territories for himself. In 1423, it came to an armed conflict between Adolf and Gerhard, who had allied himself with the Archbishop of Cologne. Peace was signed between the two brothers in 1430, and confirmed in 1437. As a result, Gerhard ruled the largest part of Mark, but was to be succeeded by his nephew John. Gerhard died in 1461 without children and the County of Mark and Duchy of Cleves were reunited again in a personal union under John I. Adolph III of the Marck (German: "Adolf III von der Mark") (– 7 September 1394) was the Bishop of Münster (as Adolph) from 1357 until 1363, the Archbishop of Cologne (as Adolph II) in 1363, the Count of Cleves (as Adolph I) from 1368 until 1394, and the Count of Mark (as Adolph III) from 1391 until 1393.

**Text:** Adolph was the second son of Count Adolph II of the Marck and Margaret of Cleves. On 16 November 1357 Pope Innocent VI appointed him the Bishop of Münster. In 1362 he signed a contract with his uncle Bishop Engelbert III of the Marck of Liège whereby he would inherit Cleves in the likely event Count John of Cleves died childless. On 13 June 1363 he was appointed the Archbishop of Cologne against the favourite John of Virneburg, but by the end of the year had resigned from the position to focus on the County of Cleves, despite the fact that his short tenure was scandalous and ridden with controversy. In 1368 he succeeded his uncle John of Cleves and could maintain his rule there through the support of Liège. In 1369 he married Margaret of Jülich, daughter of Gerhard VI of Jülich, Count of Berg and Ravensberg and had fourteen children, at least five of whom did not survive infancy. After his brother Engelbert III of the Marck died without heirs in 1391, Adolph inherited the Marck too. However, he gave Marck to his son Dietrich in 1393. Adolph died in 1394 and was succeeded in Cleves by another of his sons, Adolph. Cleves and Marck were reunited again 4 years later, when Dietrich died and was succeeded by Adolph IV. Friedrich IX, Count of Hohenzollern( d. between 1377 and 1379), nicknamed" Fredrick the Old" or" the Black Count", was a German nobleman. He was the ruling count of Hohenzollern from 1339 until his death.

**Text:** Born in Hungary, where he began his career, he worked briefly in the Austrian and German film industries during the era of silent films, before being based in Hollywood from 1926 to 1930 for the first of his two brief periods there (the other was during World War II). The change led to a divorce from his first wife, the Hungarian film actress María Corda, who was unable to make the transition from silent films to "talkies" because of her strong Hungarian accent. From 1930, Korda was active in the British film industry, and soon became one of its leading figures. He was the founder of London Films and, post-war, the owner of British Lion Films, a film distribution company. Korda produced many outstanding classics of the British film industry, including "The Private Life of Henry VIIIRembrandtThings To ComeThe Thief of Baghdad" and "The Third Man". In 1942, Korda became the first filmmaker to receive a knighthood. Dana Blankstein- Cohen( born March 3, 1981) is the director of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television.

**Text:** She was three years his junior. The Yongzheng Emperor (13 December 1678 – 8 October 1735), born Yinzhen, was the fifth Emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the third Qing emperor to rule over China proper, reigned from 1722 to 1735. A hard-working ruler, the Yongzheng Emperor's main goal was to create an effective government at minimal expense. Like his father, the Kangxi Emperor, the Yongzheng Emperor used military force to preserve the dynasty's position. His reign was known for being despotic, efficient, and vigorous. Although Yongzheng's reign was much shorter than that of both his father (the Kangxi Emperor) and his son (the Qianlong Emperor), the Yongzheng era was a period of peace and prosperity. The Yongzheng Emperor cracked down on corruption and reformed the financial administration. His reign saw the formation of the Grand Council, an institution which had an enormous impact on the future of the Qing dynasty. Hans Barthold Andresen Butenschøn( 27 December 1877 – 28 November 1971) was a Norwegian businessperson. He was born in Kristiania as a son of Nils August Andresen Butenschøn and Hanna Butenschøn, and grandson of Nicolay Andresen. Together with Mabel Anette Plahte( 1877 – 1973, a daughter of Frithjof M. Plahte) he had the son Hans Barthold Andresen Butenschøn Jr. and was through him the father- in- law of Ragnhild Butenschøn and grandfather of Peter Butenschøn.

He is the former spouse of the group's current leader, Maryam Rajavi, whom he divorced so that she could become the spouse of Massoud Rajavi. Sarah Brightman (born 14 August 1960) is an English classical crossover soprano, singer, songwriter, actress, dancer and musician. Brightman began her career as a member of the dance troupe Hot Gossip and released several disco singles as a solo performer. In 1981, she made her West End musical theatre debut in "Cats" and met composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, whom she later married. She went on to star in several West End and Broadway musicals, including "The Phantom of the Opera", where she originated the role of Christine Daaé. Her original London cast album of "Phantom" was released in CD format in 1987 and sold 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling cast album ever. After retiring from the stage and divorcing Lloyd Webber, Brightman resumed her music career with former Enigma producer Frank Peterson, this time as a classical crossover artist. She has been credited as the creator and remains among the most prominent performers of this genre, with worldwide sales of more than 35 million albums and two million DVDs, establishing herself as the world's best-selling soprano. Brightman's 1996 duet with the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, "Time to Say Goodbye", topped the charts all over Europe and became the highest and fastest-selling single of all-time in Germany, where it stayed at the top of the charts for 14 consecutive weeks and sold over three million copies.

**Text:** As a Texas Ranger, Ryan worked many cases that made him well known not only throughout the state, but throughout the nation. He is most notable for his arrest of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, but also was the Texas Ranger assigned to the Ricky Lee and Sharon Green case, two of the most notorious serial killers in Wise County, Texas history. Francis Augustus Hamer('heɪmə)( March 17, 1884 – July 10, 1955) was the Texas Ranger who led the 1934 posse that tracked down and killed criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. Renowned for his toughness, marksmanship, and investigative skill, he acquired status in the Southwest as the archetypal Texas Ranger. Hamer also led the fight in Texas against the Ku Klux Klan starting in 1922 as senior captain of the Texas Rangers, and he is believed to have saved at least fifteen people from lynch mobs. He was inducted into the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame. His professional record and reputation are not without controversy, particularly with regard to his willingness to use deadly force even in an increasingly modernized society. Overall, because of his sustained excellence and numerous exploits in a career that spanned more than forty years, Hamer has been described by biographer John Boessenecker, historian Robert Utley, and other experts on criminal justice in the United States as" one of the greatest American lawmen of the twentieth century". The Texas Ranger was the undergraduate humor publication of the University of Texas at Austin (UT), published from 1923–1972. A number of people who later went on to become key members of the underground comix scene — including Frank Stack, Gilbert Shelton, and Jaxon — were "Texas Ranger" editors and contributors during the period 1959–1965.

**Text:** In 1446, her father died and was succeeded by his cousin, Eric of Pomerania, former King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Sophia became the heir of Eric of Pomerania's private fortune. In 1451, Sophia was married to Eric of Pomerania- Wolgast, making her spouse the heir of Eric of Pomerania's territories, while Sophia remained the heir of Eric of Pomerania's private fortune. At the death of Eric of Pomerania in 1459, Sophia's husband united Pomerania through the inheritance of Pomerania- Stolp and Pomerania- Rügenwalde by his marriage, while Sophia became the sole possessor of the vast fortune brought by Eric of Pomerania from his former kingdoms in Scandinavia, as well as the wealth he had acquired by his piracy activity on Gotland. As Eric refused to allow Sophia any of the political power over the territories he acquired through her, which she felt she was entitled to, the couple separated. Sophia moved to Rügenwalde Castle with her children and her lover, Hans of Maszerski. In 1470, she refused to finance her husband's war with Brandenburg. She was widowed in 1474. According to an old legend, she was to have poisoned her sons Wratislaw and Casimir, but when she tried to the same with her son Bogislaw with a poisoned sandwich, he was warned by his jester. The sandwich was given to a dog, who died, after which Sophia was to have fled to Danzig.

Bogislaw XIII (Bogusław XIII) of Pomerania (9 August 1544 – 7 March 1606, Stettin; "Polish": Szczecin), son of Philip I and Maria of Saxony, was a prince of Stettin and Wolgast, and a member of the Griffins. Bogislaw studied at the University of Greifswald at the age of 14. At first, he was co-regent with his brother Johann Friedrich of Pomerania-Wolgast, but in 1569 he settled with control over Barth and Neuenkamp. There, he founded a printing house in 1582, publishing in 1588 the "Barther Bible", a bible in the Low German language, as translated by Johannes Bugenhagen. In 1587 he founded Franzburg to compete with Stralsund. From 1603 until his death, he ruled in Pomerania-Stettin, which he inherited under the Inheritance Treat of Jasenitz of 1509 in case his two brothers John Frederick (d. 1600) and Barnim X (d. 1603) would both die childless. He kept his residence in Barth, and his eldest son, Philip II, acted as governor in Stettin. He is remembered as a wise ruler, knowledgeable in the areas of economics and governance. He married twice: first to Clara of Brunswick-Lüneburg, daughter of Francis, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, then to Anna of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, daughter of John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg.

**Text:** ** Ali Akbar Isfahani was a 17th century Persian architect of the Safavid era. He is best known for the Shah Mosque commissioned by Shah Abbas and built in 1611 – 1631. His name appears in an inscription in the mosque above the doorway of the entrance iwan complex of the mosque. Isfahani was born in 985 AH( 1577 AD). He was a pupil of Badi' al- Zaman Yazdi, the grand architect of Shah Abbas. Badi-al Zaman Mirza Safavi was a Safavid prince, who was the son of prominent military leader Bahram Mirza Safavi, who was the youngest son of Ismail I, the founder of the Safavid empire. Badi-al Zaman had two brothers named Ibrahim Mirza and Sultan Husayn Mirza. When Badi-al Zaman's father died in 1549, he, along with his other siblings were taken care of by Tahmasp, who even announced Badi-al Zaman as his own son. Badi al-Zaman was appointed as the governor of Sistan in 1557, and married Pari Khan Khanum (who was at that time 10 years old). However, since she was Tahmasp's favored daughter, she was not allowed to go alongside her husband to Sistan. According to the other historians, however, Pari Khan Khanum was only engaged to Badi al-Zaman, which according to Gholsorkhi seems more believable. Allegedly the marriage went no farther, since Pari Khan Khanum chose a bureaucratic life in the capital, alongside her father, over married life in Sistan. On 26 March 1577, Badi-al Zaman Mirza was assassinated in Qandahar on the orders of shah Ismail II (r. 1576–77).

**Text:** ** Henry Walter Moore( 1849 – 20 August 1916) was an English- born first- class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand. Thieves Like Us is a 1974 American neo- noir crime road film directed by Robert Altman and starring Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall. The film was based on the novel" Thieves Like Us" by Edward Anderson, which was also the source material for the 1948 film" They Live by Night", directed by Nicholas Ray. The supporting cast includes Louise Fletcher and Tom Skerritt. The film was entered into the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. Robert Bernard Altman (February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the Academy Award for Best Director and an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, Altman was considered a "maverick" in making films with a highly naturalistic but stylized and satirical aesthetic, unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in American cinema. His style of filmmaking covered many genres, but usually with a "subversive" twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Altman developed a reputation for being "anti-Hollywood" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen.

Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could "make film fireworks out of next to nothing." In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman's body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations.

**Text:** ** The Warrior Queen of Jhansi is a 2019 British period drama film on the 1857 Indian Rebellion against the British East India Company. The film was co-written, produced and directed by Swati Bhise, with Charles Salmon as co-producer. The film was originally titled" Swords and Sceptres: The Rani of Jhansi". Devika Bhise, who also co-wrote the script, plays the lead role of Rani Lakshmibai. In November 2017, Rupert Everett and Derek Jacobi joined the cast. Principal photography was completed in December 2017. Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar was the 5th Maharaja of Jhansi situated in northern India, a vassal of Maratha Empire. He was the son of Shiv Rao Bhau and a descendant of Raghunath Hari Newalkar (who was the first governor of Jhansi under Maratha rule). The ancestors of Gangadhar Rao hailed from Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Some of them moved to Khandesh, when Peshwa rule began and served important posts in the Peshwa and Holkar armies. Raghunath Hari Newalkar strengthened Maratha polity in Bundelkhand, however as he grew old, he handed over the reins of Jhansi to his younger brother Shiv Rao Bhau. On the death of Raghunath Rao III in 1838, the British rulers accepted his brother Gangadhar Rao as the Raja of Jhansi in 1843. In May 1842, Gangadhar Rao married a young girl named Manikarnika, who was renamed as Laxmibai, who later became the Queen of Jhansi and revolted against the British during the uprising of 1857.

**Text:** Raja Gangadhar Rao adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of his cousin Vasudev Newalkar, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before he died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the raja requesting that the child should be treated with kindness and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the raja in November 1853 because Damodar Rao was adopted, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories.

**Text:** Swati Bhise( née Gupte; born October 21, 1959) is a Bharatanatyam dancer, choreographer, educator, producer, and promoter of the arts. Francis Xavier Fenech( 17 March 1892 – 13 May 1969) was a Maltese prelate who became the first bishop of Jhansi in India. He was born in Floriana Malta on March 17, 1892. He studied at St Aloysius College in Birkirkara. At the age of 19 he joined the Capuchin order where he was given the name of Francis Xavier and followed a course of philosophy and theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Giovanni Maria Camilleri the Bishop of Gozo on May 25, 1918. After his ordination he was assigned to work in the parish of Marsa. In June 1923 Fenech left Malta for Daman to Bombay, present day Mumbai in India. He spent six years in Bandra, Zaroli, Itarsi and Shampura. In April 1929 he was stationed in Jhansi in order to develop this territory into a diocese. The territory of Jhansi was separated from the Diocese of Allahabad in 1940 and created into an Apostolic Prefecture. Fenech was appointed as the Apostolic Administrator of the dioceses of Allahabad and Lucknow because their bishop Joseph A. Poli was taken prisoner in a concentration camp. In 1946 Fenech was appointed as the first prefect of the Apostolic Prefecture of Jhansi. In 1954 Pope Pius XII elevated the Prefecture into the Diocese of Jhansi and appointed Fenech as its first bishop.

As Germany occupied this part of Europe during World War I, he moved first to Warsaw and later to Berlin. As a young man he worked as an assistant director of the legendary German director F.W. Murnau. Upon his return to Poland he changed his name to Michał Waszyński and converted to Catholicism. In the 1930s Waszyński became the most prolific film director in Poland, directing 37 of the 147 films made in Poland in that decade, nearly one out of four. Along with the popular films in Polish directed to a wide local audience, he directed an important film in Yiddish" The Dybbuk", today a monument of the rich cultural life of East European Jewry before the Holocaust. At the beginning of World War II Waszyński escaped from Warsaw, which was being bombed by German planes, to Białystok.

That city was taken in mid-September 1939 by the Germans, but within weeks, as a result of the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact, the city was given to the Soviet Union and occupied by its army. Waszyński began a new career as a theater director, first in Białystok and later in Moscow. In the summer of 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Waszyński joined the newly formed Polish Army of general Władysław Anders( loyal to the Polish government in Exile in London) and subsequently was relocated to Persia( Iran), and later as a soldier of the 2nd Corps of the Polish Army to Egypt and Italy. As a member of the army film unit, he filmed the Battle of Monte Cassino, where the Polish Army suffered great losses, but helped to win the day. After World War II, he stayed in Italy, where he directed a Polish- language feature film about the Battle of Monte Cassino, and then three Italian films.

**Text:** The film had a one- night premiere in each country, starting in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2007 and ending on 16 November 2007 in New Zealand. It was later released on DVD in two editions: the European/ United Kingdom edition and the Australian/ New Zealand edition. These were later followed by a two- disc edition; the second disc contained a concert that was filmed during Kylie's Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour in Melbourne, Australia. The title" White Diamond" was taken from one of Kylie's songs( written by Scissor Sisters). This song is the sole new song performed by her during Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour. The film opens with a reworked ballad version of it. Two new songs," I'm Hip" and" You Are There", are on the movie's soundtrack. Also on the soundtrack is" Alone Again", a previously unrecorded 2002 song that was co-written by Madonna and Rick Nowels. Desert Victory is a 1943 film produced by the British Ministry of Information, documenting the Allies' North African campaign against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps. This documentary traces the struggle between General Erwin Rommel and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, from the German's defeat at El Alamein to Tripoli. The film was produced by David MacDonald and directed by Roy Boulting who also directed Tunisian Victory and" Burma Victory". Like the famous" Why We Fight" series of films by Frank Capra," Desert Victory" relies heavily on captured German newsreel footage. Many of the most famous sequences in the film have been excerpted and appear with frequency in History Channel and A&E productions. The film won a special Oscar in 1943 and the 1951 film took sections of the film for its battle footage.

**Text:** The film won a special Oscar in 1943 and the 1951 film took sections of the film for its battle footage. The film has been criticized for emphasizing the British role in the victory, while playing down the American contribution to the battle. Mark Harris, author of the" Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War," a book about the role that five prominent Hollywood directors played in the war, has stated in an interview on Turner Classic Movies that when asked about the omission, the British war department retorted that the Americans" did n't have any good footage." A sequel," Tunisian Victory," was produced as a co-allied production between British and American propaganda agencies, with American film makers Frank Capra and John Huston allegedly restaging actual events, such as liberations, as well as tank and air battles( some of which was actually filmed in Orlando, Florida) to achieve high quality footage that the British could not refuse. The British supposedly knew immediately that the footage was fake, but since they themselves restaged much of the footage, this uneasy collaboration continued. " Sophia" is the second single released from the re-release of Nerina Pallot's second album," Fires". It was released on October 2, 2006. It was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award in the category of Best Song( Musically and Lyrically). The single includes Pallot's cover of Kylie Minogue's" Confide in Me". Portrait of a Man may refer to: White diamond may refer to: " Right Here, Right Now" is a song recorded by Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, featuring the vocals of Kylie Minogue, for Moroder's studio album" Déjà Vu".

**Text:** ** Lucky Thirteen or Lucky 13 may refer to: Yellow House may refer to the: The Yellow House at 57–59 Macleay Street, Potts Point, was an artists' collective that existed from 1970 through to the beginning of 1973 in Sydney, Australia. The collective was established by artist Martin Sharp on his return from London at the beginning of 1970. Initially operated as a space for the exhibition of his work, Sharp and filmmaker Albie Thoms expanded the facility in 1971 to incorporate input from a variety of artists and performers. They modelled it on Vincent Van Gogh's Yellow House at Arles and the Dutch artist's partially realised dream of establishing an artists' community there. The British Arts Lab movement of the late 1960s was also an influence on Sharp, who was resident in London between 1966- 9. Many well- known artists contributed to the multi-media performance art space that may have been Australia's first 24- hour- a-day ‘ happening ’. The canvas was the house itself and almost every wall, floor and ceiling became part of the gallery and performance space. The rooms of the house were inspired by Pop Art, Surrealism, Dada and Conceptualism. Overseas visitors to the Yellow House included members of the rock band Pink Floyd, Marty Feldman and David Litvinoff. Apart from the exhibition of painting, drawing, sculpture and photography, there was also a puppet theatre, light shows, performance of plays and regular screening of films.

**Text:** During his 46- year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice, and directed both his father, Walter Huston, and daughter, Anjelica Huston, to Oscar wins. Huston studied and worked as a fine art painter in Paris in his early years. He explored the visual aspects of his films throughout his career, sketching each scene on paper beforehand, then carefully framing his characters during the shooting. While most directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot, with little editing needed. Some of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting an" heroic quest," as in" Moby Dick", or" The Red Badge of Courage". In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed, forming" destructive alliances," giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his films involved themes such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, and war. Huston has been referred to as" a titana rebel", and a" renaissance man" in the Hollywood film industry. Author Ian Freer describes him as" cinema's Ernest Hemingway" — a filmmaker who was" never afraid to tackle tough issues head on." Ando was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang, in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo( today Northeast China), to a Japanese industrialist. When the Communists took over the family fled back to Japan. After her father died in 1953, she went to work as a singer and then as a burlesque dancer. At the time of filming for" The Barbarian and the Geisha" she was and weighed.

After having written" Scream"( released the year prior), Williamson was approached to adapt Duncan's source novel by producer Erik Feig. Where Williamson's screenplay for" Scream" contained prominent elements of satire and self- referentiality, his adaptation of" I Know What You Did Last Summer" reworked the novel's central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s- era slasher film. Shot on location in California and North Carolina in the spring of 1997," I Know What You Did Last Summer" was released theatrically in North America on October 17, 1997. It received mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful, grossing$ 125 million worldwide on a budget of$ 17 million, and remaining number 1 at the U.S. box office for three consecutive weeks. It was also nominated for and won multiple awards. The film was followed by two sequels," I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"( 1998) and" I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer"( 2006). " I Know What You Did Last Summer" has also been parodied and referenced in popular culture, and credited alongside" Scream" with revitalizing the slasher genre in the 1990s.

**Text:** ** In trigonometry, the law of tangents is a statement about the relationship between the tangents of two angles of a triangle and the lengths of the opposing sides. In Figure 1,,, and are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle, and,, and are the angles" opposite" those three respective sides. The law of tangents states that The law of tangents, although not as commonly known as the law of sines or the law of cosines, is equivalent to the law of sines, and can be used in any case where two sides and the included angle, or two angles and a side, are known. The law of reciprocal proportions( also called law of equivalent proportions or law of permanent ratios) is one of the basic laws of stoichiometry. It relates the proportions in which elements combine across a number of different elements. It was first formulated by Jeremias Richter in 1791. A simple statement of the law is :- The acceptance of the law allowed tables of element equivalent weights to be drawn up. These equivalent weights were widely used by chemists in the 19th century. The other laws of stoichiometry are the law of definite proportions and the law of multiple proportions. The law of definite proportions refers to the fixed composition of any compound formed between element A and element B. The law of multiple proportions describes the stoichiometric relationship between two or more different compounds formed between element A and element B.

He is known for his academic work on the law of contract, as well as publications in the law of unjust enrichment and commercial law.

**Text:** He is known for his academic work on the law of contract, as well as publications in the law of unjust enrichment and commercial law. In logic, the law of non-contradiction( LNC)( also known as the law of contradiction, principle of non-contradiction( PNC), or the principle of contradiction) states that contradictory propositions can not both be true in the same sense at the same time, e. g. the two propositions A is B and A is not B are mutually exclusive. Formally this is expressed as the tautology ¬( p ∧ ¬p). One reason to have this law is the principle of explosion, which states that anything follows from a contradiction. The law is employed in a reductio ad absurdum proof. To express the fact that the law is tenseless and to avoid equivocation, sometimes the law is amended to say" contradictory propositions can not both be true' at the same time and in the same sense'". It is one of the so called three laws of thought, along with its complement, the law of excluded middle, and the law of identity. The law of noncontradiction is logically equivalent to the law of excluded middle by De Morgan's laws. However, no system of logic is built on just these laws, and none of these laws provide inference rules, such as modus ponens or De Morgan's laws. The law of non contradiction and the law of excluded middle create a dichotomy in" logical space", wherein the two parts are" mutually exclusive" and" jointly exhaustive". The law of non-contradiction is merely an expression of the mutually exclusive aspect of that dichotomy, and the law of excluded middle, an expression of its jointly exhaustive aspect.

The film narrates the life of Lorenzo da Ponte, Italian Freemason who would n't give up his libertinism and homosexual relations, despite being ordered to do so as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. When the Holy Inquisition accused da Ponte of having betrayed the Christian faith, condemning him to the exile, his close friend Giacomo Casanova wrote a presentation letter for Antonio Salieri, before da Ponte had to leave Venice for Vienna. Here, Salieri introduced him to Mozart, and da Pone wrote le" Nozze di Figaro". At the intervention of Casanova, da Ponte persuaded Mozart to publish a second edition of the" Don Giovanni", which was performed in presence of the Emperor Joseph II, to great success.

**Text:** George Mason IV (October 7, 1792) was an American planter, politician and delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, one of three delegates who refused to sign the Constitution. His writings, including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and his "Objections to this Constitution of Government" (1787) opposing ratification, have exercised a significant influence on American political thought and events. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights, of which he has been deemed the father. Mason was born in 1725, most likely in what is now Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he was young and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and involved himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, using his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention in 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776. Mason prepared the first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776, and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Revolutionary Virginia Convention. He also wrote a constitution for the state; Thomas Jefferson and others sought to have the convention adopt their ideas, but they found that Mason's version could not be stopped.

During the American Revolutionary War, Mason was a member of the powerful House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly but, to the irritation of Washington and others, he refused to serve in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, citing health and family commitments. In 1787, Mason was named one of his state's delegates to the Constitutional Convention and traveled to Philadelphia, his only lengthy trip outside Virginia. Many clauses in the Constitution bear his stamp, as he was active in the convention for months before deciding that he could not sign same. He cited the lack of a bill of rights most prominently in his "Objections," but also wanted an immediate end to the slave trade and a supermajority for navigation acts, which might force exporters of tobacco to use more expensive American ships. He failed to attain these objectives, and again at the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, but his prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian James Madison to introduce same during the First Congress in 1789; these amendments were ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died. Obscure after his death, Mason has come to be recognized, in the 20th and 21st centuries, for his contributions to the early United States and to Virginia.

He took part to the Third Crusade. Constance of Penthièvre (c. 1140 – after 23 June 1184) was a Breton princess, daughter of Alan of Penthièvre, 1st Earl of Richmond, and Bertha of Cornouaille, "suo jure" Duchess of Brittany. Fra' Emmanuel Marie des Neiges de Rohan- Polduc( 18 April 1725, in la Mancha, Spain – 14 July 1797, in Valletta, Malta) was a member of the wealthy and influential Rohan family of France, and 70th Prince and Grand Master of the Order of St. John from 1775 to 1797. De Rohan was born in la Mancha, Spain on 18 April 1725. His father was French, but had been banished to Spain. He served in the courts of Madrid and Parma, before becoming an ambassador to Francis I. He eventually joined the Order of St. John, and served in several posts. He was considered as a potential successor to Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca following his death in 1773, but Francisco Ximenes de Texada was elected instead. Ximenes' magistracy was unpopular due to the Order's bankruptcy. He died in 1775, and was succeeded by De Rohan. De Rohan sought to win the respect of the people, and he became a popular Grand Master.

**Text:** He died in 1775, and was succeeded by De Rohan. De Rohan sought to win the respect of the people, and he became a popular Grand Master. On 21 June 1777, he elevated the village of Żebbuġ to the status of city, naming it Città Rohan. An archway commemorating this event was constructed in 1798. The coat of arms of Żebbuġ contains the arms of the House of Rohan, in honour of the Grand Master. De Rohan authored the" Code de Rohan", a constitutional law book published in two volumes titled" Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes of Malta" in 1782. This Grand Master was also responsible for the publication of the Diritto Municipale in 1784. De Rohan instituted the Anglo- Bavarian langue, which was housed in the former Palazzo Carniero. In 1797, he established the Russian Grand Priory, which later evolved into the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller. In 1792, he commissioned and partially financed the construction of Fort Tigné. St. Lucian Tower& Battery were also upgraded during De Rohan's magistracy, and the complex was renamed Fort Rohan in 1795 after the Grand Master. It was rebuilt as Fort San Lucian in the 1870s, but it still retains De Rohan's coat of arms on the façade. The last few years of De Rohan's magistracy were troublesome, due to the decline of the Order because of the French Revolution. De Rohan suffered a stroke in 1792, and his health began to deteriorate. He died on 14 July 1797, and was buried at St. John's Co- Cathedral in Valletta.

Louis René Édouard de Rohan known as Cardinal de Rohan (25 September 1734 – 16 February 1803), "prince de Rohan-Guéméné", was a French bishop of Strasbourg, politician, cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, and cadet of the Rohan family (which traced its origin to the kings of Brittany). His parents were Hercule Mériadec, Prince of Guéméné and Louise Gabrielle Julie de Rohan. He was born in Paris. Members of the Rohan family had filled the office of Bishop of Strasbourg since 1704, which made them princes of the Holy Roman Empire and the compeers rather of the German prince-bishops than of the French ecclesiastics. Louis de Rohan was destined for this high office from birth. Soon after taking orders, in 1760, he was nominated coadjutor to his uncle, Louis Constantin de Rohan-Rochefort, who then held the bishopric, and he was also appointed titular bishop of Canopus, Egypt. But he preferred the elegant life and the gaiety of Paris to his clerical duties, and had also an ambition to make a figure in politics. In 1761 he was elected to seat 36 of the Académie française. Louis de Rohan was a member of the palace cabal opposed to the Austrian alliance.

**Text:** In 1761 he was elected to seat 36 of the Académie française. Louis de Rohan was a member of the palace cabal opposed to the Austrian alliance. This party was headed by the Duc d'Aiguillon who, in 1771, sent Rohan on a special embassy to find out what was being done in Vienna with regard to the partition of Poland. Rohan arrived at Vienna in January 1772, and made a great spectacle of himself with his lavish entertainments. Empress Maria Theresa was hostile to his intrigues; not only did he attempt to thwart her alliance with France, but as a vicar of the Church, he made little secret of his venal lifestyle. On the death of Louis XV in 1774, Rohan was recalled from Vienna, and coldly received in Paris; but his family's influence was too great for him to be neglected; in 1777 he was made Grand Almoner of France, and in 1778, abbot of St. Vaast. In 1778, he was made a cardinal on the nomination of Stanislaus Poniatowski (the king of Poland). In 1779, Louis de Rohan succeeded his uncle, Constantine de Rohan-Rochefort, as bishop of Strasbourg, though he spent much of his career working in Paris, as he preferred a fashionable life to his clerical duties; also in 1779, he became abbot of Noirmoutiers and Chaise-Dieu. Despite his enhanced status, the Cardinal was poorly received at court, having made himself an enemy of Queen Marie Antoinette, the daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, whose disapproval he had earned in Vienna.

**Text:** Despite his enhanced status, the Cardinal was poorly received at court, having made himself an enemy of Queen Marie Antoinette, the daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, whose disapproval he had earned in Vienna. Wishing to redeem himself in the eyes of the Queen, he fell into the hands of a gang of thieves, the comtesse de Lamotte, and others, perhaps including the notorious Cagliostro, whose actions form part of the "affair of the diamond necklace". Rohan was led to believe that his attentions to the Queen were welcomed, and that she approved his arrangements for her to purchase the infamous necklace. When the swindle was discovered, the Cardinal was arrested and implicated in the theft, though he was later found to have been an innocent dupe. At the trial in 1786 before the "parlement of Paris" his acquittal was received with popular enthusiasm, and regarded as a victory over the royal court at Versailles and, in particular, the Queen. He was deprived of his office as grand almoner and exiled to his abbey of Chaise-Dieu, where he was accompanied by his secretary, Louis Ramond de Carbonnières. The following year, he traveled to the thermal spas of the Pyrenees, spending the summer and the autumn in Barèges, where Ramond began his geological investigations. Rohan was soon allowed to return to Strasbourg, and his popularity was shown by his election in 1789 to the Estates-General by the clergy of the bailliages of Haguenau and Wissembourg. He, at first, declined to sit, but when the Estates-General became the National Assembly, it insisted on validating his election.

However, in January 1791, as a prince of the church, he refused to take the oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, and went to Ettenheim, in the German part of his diocese. In exile, his character improved and he spent what wealth remained to him in providing for the poor clergy of his diocese who had been obliged to leave France. On 29 November 1801, he resigned his nominal office as Bishop of Strasbourg and went back to Ettenheim, where he died on 17 February 1803.

**Text:** Some Like It Hot" opened to critical and commercial success and is today considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. It was voted as the top comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs poll in 2000, and was selected as the best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017. In 2005, the British Film Institute included this film on its list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. The film was produced without approval from the Motion Picture Production Code because it plays with the idea of homosexuality and features cross dressing. The code had been gradually weakening in its scope during the early 1950s, due to greater social tolerance for previously taboo topics in film, but it was still officially enforced until the mid-1960s. The overwhelming success of" Some Like It Hot" is considered one of the final nails in the coffin for the Hays Code. Come Back Peter is a 1969 British sex comedy film. It was released in the UK under the title Some Like It Sexy. Under the Dome is a 2015 self- financed, Chinese documentary film by Chai Jing, a former China Central Television journalist, concerning air pollution in China. It was viewed over 150 million times on Tencent within three days of its release, and had been viewed a further 150 million times( total 300 million views) by the time it was taken offline four days later. Chai Jing started making the documentary when her as yet unborn daughter developed a tumour in the womb, which had to be removed very soon after her birth. Chai blames air pollution for the tumour.

**Text:** Chai Jing started making the documentary when her as yet unborn daughter developed a tumour in the womb, which had to be removed very soon after her birth. Chai blames air pollution for the tumour. The film, which combines footage of a lecture with interviews and factory visits, has been compared with Al Gore's" An Inconvenient Truth" in both its style and likely impact. The film openly criticises state- owned energy companies, steel producers and coal factories, as well as showing the inability of the Ministry of Environmental Protection to act against the big polluters. Despite demonstrating the failure of China's regulations on pollution, the Chinese government at first did not censor the film. Instead, the" People's Daily" reposted the film alongside an interview with Chai, while Chen Jining, the recently appointed minister for environmental protection, praised the film. However, within a week, the Communist Party ’s publicity department confidentially ordered the film to be removed. An employee of China Business News was suspended for leaking the order.

**Text:** William, Duke of Brunswick( 25 April 1806 – 18 October 1884), was ruling duke of the Duchy of Brunswick from 1830 until his death. William was the second son of Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick- Lüneburg, and after the death of his father in 1815, was under the guardianship of King George IV of the United Kingdom. He became a Prussian major in 1823. When his brother, Charles, was deposed as ruling duke by a rebellion in 1830, William took over the government provisionally. In 1831, a family law of the House of Guelph made William the ruling duke permanently. William left most government business to his ministers, and he spent most of his time outside of his state at his possessions in Oels. While William joined the Prussian- led North German Confederation in 1866, his relationship to Prussia was strained, since Prussia refused to recognize Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, his nearest male- line relative, as his heir, because of the Duke of Cumberland's claim to the throne of Hanover. William died in 1884; he passed on his private possessions to the Duke of Cumberland. His death caused a constitutional crisis for Brunswick that lasted until the accession of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, the son of the Crown Prince of Hanover, in 1913. William died unmarried, but had a number of illegitimate children. Ernest Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel-Bevern (4 March 1682 in Osterholz – 14 April 1746 in Brunswick) was a titular Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg. He was Prince of Brunswick-Bevern and founder of the younger Brunswick-Bevern line.

The duke was a cultured and benevolent despot in the model of Frederick the Great, and was married to Princess Augusta, a sister of George III of Great Britain. He was also a recognized master of 18th century warfare, serving as a Field Marshal in the Prussian Army. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was mortally wounded by a musket ball at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806. August Wilhelm, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern (1715 in Braunschweig1781 in Stettin), Prussian soldier, son of Ernest Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, was born in Braunschweig in 1715, and entered the Prussian army in 1731, becoming colonel of an infantry regiment in 1739. He won great distinction at the battle of Hohenfriedberg as a major-general, and was promoted lieutenant-general in 1750. Bevern was one of the most experienced and exact soldiers in the army of Frederick the Great. He commanded a wing in the battle of Lobositz in 1756, and defeated the Austrians under Marshal Königsegg in a well-fought battle at Reichenberg on 21 April 1757.

He took part in the battles of Prague and Kolin and the retreat to Görlitz, and subsequently commanded the Prussians left behind by Frederick in the autumn of 1757 when he marched against the French. Bevern conducted a defensive campaign against overwhelming numbers with great skill, but he soon lost the valuable assistance of General Winterfeldt, who was killed in a skirmish at Moys; and he was eventually brought to battle and suffered a heavy defeat at the battle of Breslau on 22 November. He fell into the hands of the Austrians on the following morning, and remained prisoner for a year. He was made general of infantry in 1759, and on 11 August 1762 inflicted a severe defeat at Reichenbach on an Austrian army endeavouring to relieve Schweidnitz. Bevern retired, after the peace of Hubertusburg, to his government of Stettin, where he died in peace in 1781.

**Text:** From 1908 to 1910 he also worked as a music director for Odeon Records and conducted (without label credit) two of the earliest complete symphony recordings, the Beethoven Fifth and Sixth Symphonies with the "Grosses Odeon Streich-Orchester". Künneke later worked under Max Reinhardt and wrote incidental music for Reinhardt’s staging of Part Two of Goethe's "Faust". Künneke's graceful music is distinguished by its rhythm and striking harmonies. His best-known work is the 1921 operetta "Der Vetter aus Dingsda"; many of his songs are still familiar today. In 1926, when his operetta "Lady Hamilton" was premiered in Breslau (now Wrocław), he formed what would become a long friendship with the conductor Franz Marszalek. Marszalek was a dedicated advocate of Künneke's music, and during his tenure at the Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne (1949–65) made numerous recordings of his works (many currently unavailable) with the Cologne Radio Orchestra and the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra. Tarcisio Fusco was an Italian composer of film scores. He was the brother of the composer Giovanni Fusco and the uncle of operatic soprano Cecilia Fusco. Abe Meyer( 1901 – 1969) was an American composer of film scores. Walter Ulfig was a German composer of film scores. Alonso Mudarra( c. 1510 – April 1, 1580) was a Spanish composer of the Renaissance, and also played the vihuela, a guitar- shaped string instrument. He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.

**Text:** ** Asfar ibn Kurduya( also spelled Kurdawayh, Kardawayh and Kurdawaih), was a Daylamite officer who served the Buyid dynasty. Asfar is first mentioned during the reign of the Buyid ruler Adud al- Dawla, as one of the most prominent officers of the Empire. After the death of Adud al- Dawla in 983, the Buyid Empire was thrown into civil war; the Empire was disputed between his two sons Samsam al- Dawla and Sharaf al- Dawla. Samsam al- Dawla ruled Iraq, while Sharaf al- Dawla ruled Fars and Kerman. In 986, Asfar rebelled against Samsam al- Dawla, and changed his allegiance to Sharaf al- Dawla. However, Asfar quickly changed his mind, and declared allegiance to the latter's other brother Abu Nasr Firuz Kharshadh, who was shortly given the" laqab" of" Baha' al- Dawla." However, Samsam al- Dawla, with the aid of Fuladh ibn Manadhar, suppressed the rebellion, and imprisoned Baha al- Dawla. After this event, Asfar is no longer mentioned. Ṣafiyy al- Dawla Muḥammad ibn ʿ Ali ibn Jaʾfar ibn Falāh was the Fatimid governor of Aleppo between October 1022 and April 1023. He was specifically assigned to govern the city, while the citadel of Aleppo was assigned to a separate governor, the eunuch Yumn al- Dawla Sa'adat. This marked the first time the Fatimids appointed separate rulers for the city and citadel of Aleppo since they gained direct control over the city in October 1016.

Safiyy al- Dawla belonged to the Kutama, a militant Berber group that played a major role in the Fatimid military, and he was the grandson of the Fatimid general Ja'far ibn Fallah. He was bestowed with the title" ṣafiyy al- dawla"( chosen of the State). Safiyy al- Dawla and Yumn al- Dawla were appointed to Aleppo to replace Abu'l- Najm Badr. Nothing is known about their reign and Safiyy al- Dawla was dismissed in April 1023, and succeeded by Sanad al- Dawla Hasan. Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Hasan , better known by his "laqab" of Fakhr al-Dawla ("Pride of the Dynasty") (died October or November 997) was the Buyid amir of Jibal (976–980, 984–997), Hamadan (984–997) and Gurgan and Tabaristan (984–997). He was the second son of Rukn al-Dawla. Ali ibn Kama, the uncle of the Buyid ruler Rukn al- Dawla and the latter's other brothers Mu'izz al- Dawla and Imad al- Dawla, was a Buyid military officer who became prominent among the Buyids of Jibal, and was greatly honored among his Daylamite kinsmen. At the death of Imad al- Dawla in 949, Ali was appointed as the viceroy of Ray by Rukn al- Dawla, who went to Shiraz to secure the succession of his son there, Adud al- Dawla.

In ca. 959, a battle ensured between Ali and the Ziyarid prince Bisutun, which resulted in a Buyid victory. In 966, Ali and Rukn al- Dawla defeated a large force of" ghazis" who had arrived from Khorasan. Rukn al- Dawla later died in 976 and was succeeded by his son Fakhr al- Dawla, who had Ali executed. Abu Taleb Rostam, known as Majd al- Dawla, was the Buyid emir of Rayy, a city in Iran( 997–1029). He was the eldest son of Fakhr al- Dawla.

**Text:** He is widely regarded as the greatest monarch of the dynasty, and by the end of his reign was the most powerful ruler in the Middle East. The son of Rukn al- Dawla, Fanna Khusraw was given the title of Adud al- Dawla by the Abbasid caliph in 948 when he was made emir of Fars after the death of his childless uncle Imad al- Dawla, after which Rukn al- Dawla became the senior emir of the Buyids. In 974 Adud al- Dawla was sent by his father to save his cousin Izz al- Dawla from a rebellion. After defeating the rebel forces, he claimed the emirate of Iraq for himself, and forced his cousin to abdicate. His father, however, became angered by this decision and restored Izz al- Dawla. After the death of Adud al- Dawla's father, his cousin rebelled against him, but was defeated. Adud al- Dawla became afterwards the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty and assumed the ancient Iranian title of Shahanshah(" King of Kings"). When Adud al- Dawla became emir of Iraq, the capital city, Baghdad, was suffering from violence and instability owing to sectarian conflict. In order to bring peace and stability to the city, he ordered the banning of public demonstrations and polemics. At the same time, he patronized a number of Shia scholars such as al- Mufid, and sponsored the renovation of a number of important Shia shrines. In addition,' Adud al- Dawla is credited with sponsoring and patronizing other scientific projects during his time. An observatory was built by his orders in Isfahan where Azophi worked.

Al- Muqaddasi also reports that he ordered the construction of a great dam between Shiraz and Estakhr in 960. The dam irrigated some 300 villages in Fars province and became known as" Band -e Amir"( Dam of the emir). Among his other major constructions was the digging of the Haffar channel, that joined the Karun river to the Shatt al- Arab river( the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates). The port of Khorramshahr was built on the Haffar, at its joining point with the Shatt al- Arab. Sayyida Shirin, also simply known as Sayyida, was a Bavandid princess, who was the wife of Buyid ruler of Ray, Fakhr al- Dawla.

Ziyar had a cousin, who married the Buyid ruler Adud al- Dawla, and bore him one son named Abu Kalijar Marzuban. During that period, Ziyar, along with a Daylamite officer named Fuladh ibn Manadhar, dominated the Buyid court of Baghdad. After the death of Adud al- Dawla in 983, the Buyid Empire was thrown into civil war; the Empire was disputed between his two sons Abu Kalijar Marzuban( who took the name Samsam al- Dawla) and Sharaf al- Dawla. The Turkic soldiers of Iraq shortly betrayed Samsam al- Dawla, and went towards to the court of Sharaf al- Dawla.

" Where Was I?" may refer to: The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.

**Text:** He was involved in the chaos that surrounded the succession to Sultan Bayezid II (1481–1512). Murad's father, Ahmet, the legal heir to the Ottoman throne, had fought against Şehzade Selim (later Selim I); during this struggle, Ahmet received support from King ("Shah") Ismail I (1501–1524) of the neighboring Safavid Empire. When Ahmet was put to death by the victorious Selim, Prince Murad was subsequently given support by Ismail I as claimant to the throne. Ismail I wanted to use prince Murad to mobilize opposition against Selim I. In 1512, during Nur-Ali Khalifa's large-scale campaign in Anatolia, Murad joined his campaign, and even "girded the Qizilbash crown". According to information Selim I received from his spies (December 1512/January 1513), Ismail I allegedly wanted to conquer Anatolia, give the Rum beylerbeylik to Murad, while the rest of the territory would be ruled by the Qizilbash. Anyhow, when the Safavid support meant for Murad failed to materialize, the scheme was abandoned, and Murad migrated to the Safavid Empire where he was given asylum. He died at Kashan, or Isfahan. Ismail I's support to these rivals of Selim I formed one of the main "casus belli" that led to the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514). Ferid Murad( born September 14, 1936) is an Albanian American physician and pharmacologist, and a co-winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Lake Powell, and all of its points of interest, is in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, managed by the National Park Service and available to the public for recreation. The town existed on land that Lake Powell now covers. Hite was named for Cass Hite, an early settler. The name was transferred to a National Park Recreation Area at the north end of Lake Powell. The Hite Crossing Bridge, near the marina, carries Utah State Route 95 over the Colorado River and connects the area to the north of the lake. Hiidenvesi is the second largest lake in the Uusimaa region in Finland. The biggest part of the lake is located in the municipality of Vihti and smaller parts in the town of Lohja.

**Text:** The lake drains through the Väänteenjoki River into the lake Lohjanjärvi and the both lakes are part of the Karjaanjoki basin that drains into the Gulf of Finland. Lake Powell is a reservoir on the Colorado River, straddling the border between Utah and Arizona, United States. Most of Lake Powell, along with Rainbow Bridge National Monument, is located in Utah. It is a major vacation spot that around two million people visit every year. It is the second largest man-made reservoir by maximum water capacity in the United States behind Lake Mead, storing of water when full. However, due to high water withdrawals for human and agricultural consumption, and because of subsequent droughts in the area, Lake Mead has fallen below Lake Powell in size several times during the 21st century in terms of volume of water, depth and surface area. Lake Powell was created by the flooding of Glen Canyon by the Glen Canyon Dam, which also led to the creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a popular summer destination. The reservoir is named for explorer John Wesley Powell, a one- armed American Civil War veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869. In 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established. It is public land managed by the National Park Service, and available to the public for recreational purposes. It lies in parts of Garfield, Kane, and San Juan counties in southern Utah, and Coconino County in northern Arizona. The northern limits of the lake extend at least as far as the Hite Crossing Bridge. Lake Powell is a water storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the Colorado River Compact( Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico).

The film also has a strong feminine viewpoint belonging to French feminism and raises questions about how women are perceived, especially in French society. Mirrors appear frequently to symbolize self- obsession, which Cléo embodies. The film includes cameos by Jean- Luc Godard, Anna Karina, Eddie Constantine and Jean- Claude Brialy as characters in the silent film Raoul shows Cléo and Dorothée, while composer Michel Legrand, who wrote the film's score, plays" Bob the pianist".

Varda's work employed location shooting in an era when the limitations of sound technology made it easier and more common to film indoors, with constructed sets and painted backdrops of landscapes, rather than outdoors, on location. Her use of non-professional actors was also unconventional for 1950s French cinema. Among other awards and nominations, she received an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, an Academy Honorary Award, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

**Text:** ** The Iron Hand of the Mafia is a 1980 Italian film directed by Roberto Girometti. Days of Heaven is a 1978 American romantic period drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick and starring Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard, and Linda Manz. Set in 1916, it tells the story of Bill and Abby, lovers who travel to the Texas Panhandle to harvest crops for a wealthy farmer. Bill encourages Abby to claim the fortune of the dying farmer by tricking him into a false marriage. "Days of Heaven" was Malick's second feature film, after "Badlands" (1973), and was produced on a budget of $3 million. Production was particularly troublesome, with a tight shooting schedule in Canada in 1976 and significant budget constraints. Additionally, editing took Malick a lengthy two years, due to difficulty with achieving a general flow and assembly of the scenes. This was eventually solved with an added, improvised narration by Linda Manz. The film was scored by Ennio Morricone and photographed by Néstor Almendros and Haskell Wexler. "Days of Heaven" received positive reviews on its original theatrical release; its photography was widely praised, although a small number of critics considered only this aspect to be worthy of high praise. It was not a significant commercial success, but did win an Academy Award for Best Cinematography along with three nominations for the score, costume design and sound. Malick also won the Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival. "Days of Heaven" has since become one of the most acclaimed films of its decade, noted particularly for its cinematography. In 2007, it was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

**Text:** ** Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed Al Nahyan is the United Arab Emirates Head of State for National Security Advisor. Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan was the grandfather of current Ruler Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and father of previous ruler Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. He killed his brother Hamdan in 1922 to rule Abu Dhabi, but was himself toppled and killed by another brother Saqr in 1926. Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan( 1968 – 26 March 2010) was an Emirati businessman and the managing director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan is the son of former United Arab Emirates President Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan; the half brother of the present ruler of Abu Dhabi, the President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; and the half brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Although a member of the royal family and apart from being a prominent real estate developer in the UAE, being the owner of Al Hekma Tower in Dubai, Issa bin Zayed holds no official or political position within the government of the United Arab Emirates. In April 2009 Issa bin Zayed was subject to a controversy in which a video tape of torture smuggled out of the United Arab Emirates to the United States by two Palestinian brothers, who were his business associates, showed Issa mercilessly torturing a man with whips, electric cattle prods, and wooden planks with protruding nails and running him over repeatedly with an SUV. Issa bin Zayed was initially put under arrest with the UAE government stating that matters were resolved" privately". One of the Palestinian brothers, Nabulsi, claimed Issa bin Zayed breached his contract and subjected him to torture, emotional distress, and malicious prosecution and demanded$ 80 million in repatriation.

**Text:** ** Margaret Stafford( born c. 1364; died 9 June 1396) was the daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, and Philippa de Beauchamp. She was the first wife of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and the grandmother of the 2nd Earl. Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk (1367 – 17 September 1415) was an English nobleman who supported Henry IV (reigned 1399-1413) against Richard II (reigned 1377-1399) during the turmoils of the late 14th century. He died during the Siege of Harfleur in 1415. He was the eldest son of Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Katherine Wingfield, daughter of Sir John Wingfield. His father fled abroad amid accusations of treason during the Merciless Parliament in 1388, forfeiting the title of Earl of Suffolk and the family estates. Over the next decade the younger Michael de la Pole made vigorous attempts to recover these lands, and obtained most of them piecemeal between 1389 and 1392, following his father's death. However, his close association with the Lords Appellant, particularly the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Gloucester prejudiced Richard II against him. He finally obtained the restoration of the earldom in January 1398. While he obeyed the summons of the Duke of York to defend the kingdom against Henry Bolingbroke in July 1399, Suffolk did not object to the disbandment of York's army and consented to the deposition of Richard II in the summer of 1399.

**Text:** While the first Parliament of Henry IV technically upheld the forfeitures of the Merciless Parliament, Henry IV immediately restored de la Pole's estates and title in recognition of his support. However, he would spend the remainder of his life trying to obtain possession of the remaining estates which had not been restored. He played a relatively small role in national politics, although he regularly attended Parliament. He took part in the campaign in Scotland in 1400, in naval operations around 1405, and served as the senior English diplomat at the Council of Pisa (1409). Suffolk also acted as a lieutenant of the Duke of Clarence during his campaign of 1412–1413. However, he devoted most of his energies to re-establishing de la Pole influence in East Anglia. He took the role of a justice of the peace in Norfolk and Suffolk from 1399, and assembled a considerable following among the local gentry. He completed his father's building plans at Wingfield, Suffolk and enlarged the local church. Suffolk brought 40 men-at-arms and 120 archers with him on the 1415 campaign of Henry V in France. He died of dysentery at Harfleur, and was succeeded by his eldest son Michael, who later died at Agincourt. Edmund de Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford was the son of Nicholas de Stafford, who was summoned to parliament by writ on 6 February 1299 by King Edward I.

He is generally said to have been a son of Roger I of Tosny; primary evidence is lacking to determine his parentage, according to Cawley. Cawley notes that Robert de Stafford is connected to the Tosny family through a charter( not dated) under which" Robertus de Stafford" confirmed donations to Wotton Wawen Abbey, Warwickshire by" avus meus Robertus de Toenio et pater meus Nicolaus de Stafford." Also" Robertus de Staffordia et Robertus filius meus et hæres" confirmed donations of property to Evesham Monastery by" Rodbertus avus meus ... et pater meus Nicholaus" by undated charter. He held a large number of lordships in the Domesday Survey, a high proportion lying in Staffordshire. They included Barlaston and Bradley in Staffordshire and part of Duns Tew in Oxfordshire. Robert de Stafford was buried in Evesham Abbey. Lee Stafford( born 17 October 1966) is an award- winning celebrity hairdresser.

**Text:** Michael von Abercron( born 17 November 1952) is an agricultural engineer and politician of the Christian Democratic Union( CDU). Henry Walter Moore( 1849 – 20 August 1916) was an English- born first- class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand. Hartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 – 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s. Johann Michael von Puchberg( September 21, 1741, Zwettl, Lower Austria – January 21, 1822, Vienna) was a textile merchant who lived in Vienna in the 18th and early 19th centuries. He is remembered as a friend of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart whom he lent considerable sums of money during a difficult period in the composer's life. Johann Michael Graff( sometimes also Johann Michael Graaf, Johann Michael Graaff, Johann Michael Graf or Johann Michael Kraff, fl. c. 1765- 68), was a German Rococo sculptor and plasterer. Among his most celebrated decorations are those at Schönhausen Palace, Germany, and Rundāle Palace, Latvia. Johann Michael Graff came from a family of stucco decorators from Bavaria. The family had been members of the so- called Wessobrunner School. Johann Michael Graff however seems to have moved to Brandenburg at some point and was influenced by the decorative style predominant in and around Berlin at the time. He very probably made decorations for Schönhausen Palace before being hired by the Duke of Courland, Peter von Biron, to decorate his residences in present- day Latvia.

**Text:** ** Mahler is a 1974 biographical film based on the life of Austro- Bohemian composer Gustav Mahler. It was written and directed by Ken Russell for Goodtimes Enterprises, and starred Robert Powell as Gustav Mahler and Georgina Hale as Alma Mahler. The film was entered into the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Technical Grand Prize. Henry Kenneth Alfred Russell (3 July 1927 – 27 November 2011) was a British film director, known for his pioneering work in television and film and for his flamboyant and controversial style. His films in the main were liberal adaptations of existing texts, or biographies, notably of composers of the Romantic era. Russell began directing for the BBC, where he made creative adaptations of composers' lives which were unusual for the time. He also directed many feature films independently and for studios. He is best known for his Oscar-winning film "Women in Love" (1969), "The Devils" (1971), The Who's "Tommy" (1975), and the science fiction film "Altered States" (1980). Russell also directed several films based on the lives of classical music composers, such as Elgar, Delius, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and Liszt. Film critic Mark Kermode, speaking in 2006, and attempting to sum up the director's achievement, called Russell, "somebody who proved that British cinema didn't have to be about kitchen-sink realism—it could be every bit as flamboyant as Fellini. Later in his life he turned to making low-budget experimental films such as "Lion's Mouth" and "Revenge of the Elephant Man", and they are as edgy and 'out there' as ever". Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

Originally Barnard intended the film to be a straightforward adaptation of the novel, which was set in southern France and involved two sets of elderly siblings involved in a property dispute. Encouraged by the financiers to make the story her own, Barnard changed the location of the film to Yorkshire, and instead focused on a woman who returns to the home she fled 15 years earlier in order to claim the tenancy of her father's farm, who then becomes involved in a dispute with her brother.

**Text:** ** Mulberry Violence is the debut album by American experimental artist Trevor Powers. The album came out on August 17, 2018 .. Tha Carter IV is the ninth studio album by American rapper Lil Wayne, released on August 29, 2011, through Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Universal Republic Records. Recording sessions for the album began in late 2008, shortly after Lil Wayne's sixth studio album," Tha Carter III"( 2008) was released to strong sales and critical acclaim: however, the sessions were put on hold, as Lil Wayne claimed he did not want to follow an album he held in high regard so quickly with another, potentially inferior release. In the interim, Lil Wayne released his two other albums in 2010: the largely rock- themed" Rebirth", and" I Am Not a Human Being". The latter was reportedly composed from unreleased material from the original" Tha Carter IV" sessions, as the album was released whilst Wayne served a prison sentence at Rikers Island prison for illegal possession of a weapon, and was thus unable to record any new material: this also meant" Tha Carter IV"'s recording sessions were once more put on hold. Following Wayne's release from prison, the album was re-recorded from scratch. The recording sessions resumed at various locations, involving several record producers including Bangladesh, Detail, T- Minus, Noah" 40" Shebib, Polow da Don, Jim Jonsin, Kane Beatz, Boi- 1 da, Willy Will, Streetrunner, Cool& Dre, Young Ladd, The Smeezingtons, and Kanye West. The album's largely concerns the themes of sex, violence, drugs and crime, but also love, hurt and emotional conflict.

**Text:** ** John Adams( 1672 or 1673 – 1745) was an American- born Canadian merchant and member of the Nova Scotia Council. He was the father- in- law of Henry Newton( politician). Johann Ludwig von Westphalen( 11 July 1770 – 3 March 1842) was a liberal Prussian civil servant and the father- in- law of Karl Marx. Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus( born 161 -?) was a Roman noble of Greek Athenian and Italian Roman descent who lived in the Roman Empire. Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus was the son born to the Aristocrat Lucius Vibullius Rufus and the noblewoman Athenais. He had an elder paternal half brother called Lucius Vibullius Claudius Herodes. The parents of Hipparchus were paternal second cousins. The paternal grandfather of Hipparchus was Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus who served as an Archon of Athens in 143- 144 AD, while his maternal grandparents were Roman Senator, Sophist Lucius Vibullius Hipparchus Tiberius Claudius Atticus Herodes or Herodes Atticus and the Roman aristocratic noblewoman Aspasia Annia Regilla. His grandfathers were first cousins as the mother of Herodes Atticus and the father of Publius Aelius Vibullius Rufus were brother and sister. Through his late maternal grandmother, Hipparchus was a relative to the family of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius and the Roman Empress Faustina the Elder. When Hipparchus was born, Athenais named him in honor of his maternal grandfather and paternal great grandfather. Shortly after his birth Athenais had died. Hipparchus was raised by his father, even perhaps by his maternal grandfather. He was born and raised in Athens.

The film begins by describing the difficulties the civilian population posed during the Battle of Saipan including the famous mass suicide of Japanese who believed the US would torture them. As the Marianas campaign progressed though, the Marines learned to use the Intelligence Division( ID) to handle the Japanese civilians, and by the time the Marines reached Okinawa, the ID had become a routine part of the operation. The Marianas and Okinawa, pre-war Japanese possessions, had large Japanese civilian populations at the time of their occupation, whereas other islands, like Tarawa, Guam or Iwo Jima, were either uninhabited by civilians, or only by indigenous civilians. The ID used a variety of techniques to handle the Japanese civilians: they first made loudspeaker announcements in Japanese to coax them into surrendering; once a group surrendered they found a community leader or someone in a position of authority to make more loudspeaker broadcasts to encourage further surrenders.

**Text:** ** I Want Your Love is the title of both a 2010 short film and a 2012 feature- length film. Both films were directed and written by Travis Mathews. The drama films both revolve around the friends and ex-lovers of Jesse Metzger, a gay man in his mid-thirties who is forced to move back to his hometown from San Francisco due to financial reasons. The actors' own names, along with much of their real- life stories, were used for their characters in both films, which features graphic sexual scenes. The production of both films was aided by the gay pornographic studio NakedSword. This led to the full- length film being refused exemption from classification, which would have allowed it to screen at the Melbourne Queer Film Festival, a decision to which actor James Franco( who invited Mathews to collaborate on Franco's film" Interior. Leather Bar.") reacted negatively. Jack Shea (August 1, 1928 – April 28, 2013) was an American film and television director. He was the president of the Directors Guild of America from 1997 to 2002.

The Nude Bomb( also known as The Return of Maxwell Smart) is a 1980 American spy comedy film based on the television series" Get Smart". It stars Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86, and was directed by Clive Donner. It was retitled" The Return of Maxwell Smart" for television. Co-creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry notably had no involvement in the making of the film. Furthermore, Adams and Robert Karvelas( as Larrabee) were the only original cast members of the TV series to reprise their roles for the film. Dana Elcar plays the Chief in this film due to Edward Platt's death in 1974. Barbara Feldon's character from the series, Agent 99, does not appear in film nor is she referenced; Feldon was unaware of the film's production and was not asked to reprise her role. Sylvia Kristel, at the time well known for her appearances in the" Emmanuelle" film series, makes a brief appearance as Agent 34, with Andrea Howard as Agent 22( in a role similar to Agent 99) and Vittorio Gassman playing the Blofeld- like villain. Joey Forman, who played Harry Hoo in the TV series, was recast as Agent 13. Pamela Hensley, who was by now well known to science fiction fans for playing Princess Ardala in" Buck Rogers in the 25th Century", appeared as Agent 36.

**Text:** It is set in the world of American professional football. The plot involves a love triangle between the characters portrayed by Reynolds, Kristofferson, and Clayburgh. " Semi-Tough" also includes a parody of Werner Erhard's Erhard Seminars Training ("est"), depicted in the film as an organization called "B.E.A.T." The film is based on the novel of the same name by Dan Jenkins. It was adapted for the screen by writer Walter Bernstein and director Ritchie, who added a new storyline that included a satire of the self-help movement and new religions. "Semi-Tough" follows the story of pro football friends Billy Clyde Puckett and Marvin "Shake" Tiller, who have a third roommate, Barbara Jane Bookman. A romance develops with Shake until he becomes self-confident after completing a self awareness course called "B.E.A.T." led by Friedrich Bismark that he insists Barbara Jane try, at which point Billy Clyde slyly makes a play to win her for himself. The film received mixed receptions. Some reviewers praised its parodies of the est training, Erhard and other new age movements such as Rolfing. Others criticized the script and direction, noting that some of director Ritchie's previous films had more of a personal tone. Still other reviews lamented the film's departure from the novel "Semi-Tough", which dealt more with football and less with the new age movement. Bommalattam is a 2008 Indian Tamil film directed by Bharathiraja starring Arjun Sarja and Nana Patekar in the lead roles.

**Text:** ** Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Nolan and David S. Goyer. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it stars Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, and Morgan Freeman. The film reboots the" Batman" film series, telling the origin story of Bruce Wayne from the death of his parents to his journey to become Batman and his fight to stop Ra's al Ghul and the Scarecrow from plunging Gotham City into chaos. Following the poor reception of" Batman& Robin"( 1997), a series of unsuccessful attempts were made to resurrect Batman on the big screen which put the" Batman" film series on hold for nearly eight years. Then, in early 2003, Nolan and Goyer began work on" Batman Begins". Aiming for a darker, more realistic tone compared to the previous films, a primary goal for their vision was to engage the audience's emotional investment in both the Batman and Bruce Wayne identities of the lead character. The film, which was principally shot in the United Kingdom, Iceland and Chicago, relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects, with computer- generated imagery being used in a minimal capacity compared to other action films. Comic book storylines such as" The Man Who Falls" and served as inspiration. " Batman Begins" opened on June 15, 2005, in the United States and Canada in 3,858 theaters. It grossed over$ 48 million in its opening weekend in North America, eventually grossing over$ 375 million worldwide. The film was met with highly positive reviews, with critics praising the tone, Bale's performance, action sequences, score, direction, and the emotional weight compared to previous Batman films.

**Text:** Eleni Zaude Gabre- Madhin, an Ethiopian economist with Swiss nationality, is a former Chief Executive Officer of the Ethiopia Commodity Exchange( ECX). She has had many years of experience working on agricultural markets – particularly in Sub- Saharan Africa – and has held senior positions in the World Bank, the International Food Policy Research Institute( Washington), and United Nations( Geneva). Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986) was an American author of science fiction and fantasy stories, and the founder of the Church of Scientology. In 1950, Hubbard authored and established a series of organizations to promote Dianetics. In 1952, Hubbard lost the rights to Dianetics in bankruptcy proceedings, and he subsequently founded Scientology. Thereafter Hubbard oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization. Born in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911, Hubbard spent much of his childhood in Helena, Montana. After his father was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam, Hubbard traveled to Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s. In 1930, Hubbard enrolled at George Washington University to study civil engineering but dropped out in his second year. He began his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories and married Margaret "Polly" Grubb, who shared his interest in aviation. Hubbard was an officer in the Navy during World War II, where he briefly commanded two ships but was removed from command both times. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a variety of complaints. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as "Commodore" of the Sea Organization, an elite paramilitary group of Scientologists.

**Text:** During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as "Commodore" of the Sea Organization, an elite paramilitary group of Scientologists. Some ex-members and scholars have described the Sea Org as a totalitarian organization marked by intensive surveillance and a lack of freedom. Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the California desert. In 1978, Hubbard was convicted of fraud after he was tried "in absentia" by France. In August 1978, 11 high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges for their role in the Church's Operation Snow White, one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history, with up to 5,000 covert agents. One of the indicted was Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard. L. Ron Hubbard was named an unindicted co-conspirator. Hubbard spent the remaining years of his life in a luxury motorhome on his California property, attended to by a small group of Scientology officials including his physician. In 1986, L. Ron Hubbard died at age 74. Following Hubbard's death, Scientology leaders announced that his body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to "drop his body" to continue his research on another planet. Though many of Hubbard's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious, The Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in hagiographic terms and rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard's life is not historical fact. Iraqi nationality is transmitted by one's parents. Khalid al- Habib also believed to use the nom de guerre Khalid al Harbi is an Al- Qaeda leader who has overseen Al- Qaeda operations in Afghanistan.

**Text:** He succeeded his brother in 1023 with the support of the Emperor Henry II, but was opposed until Conrad II forced the rebels to submit in 1025. When the House of Bar, which ruled in Upper Lorraine, became extinct in 1033, with the death of his cousin Frederick III, Conrad made him duke of both duchies, so that he could assist in the defence of the territory against Odo II, count of Blois, Meaux, Chartres, and Troyes (the later Champagne). In the battle at Bar on 15 November 1037, Gothelo dealt a decisive blow to Odo, who was trying to create an independent state between France and Germany. Odo died in the battle. Gothelo died on 19 April 1044 and was buried in the Abbey Church of Bilzen. His son Godfrey succeeded in Upper Lorraine, but the Emperor Henry III refused to give him the duchy of Lower Lorraine as well. When Godfrey showed disagreement with the imperial decision, Henry III threatened to pass the duchy to Godfrey's incompetent brother Gothelo. This caused a long rebellion in Lotharingia between the allies of Godfrey (the counts of Flanders and Leuven) and imperial forces (1044–1056). Godfrey I (died 1002), called the Prisoner or the Captive ("le Captif"), sometimes the Old ("le Vieux"), was the count of Bidgau and Methingau from 959 and the count of Verdun from 963 to his death. In 969, he obtained the Margraviate of Antwerp and Ename. Between 974 and 998, he was also the count of Hainault and Mons. He was the son of Gozlin, Count of Bidgau and Methingau, and Oda of Metz.

**Text:** George Frederick of Baden-Durlach (30 January 1573 – 24 September 1638) was Margrave of Baden-Durlach from 1604 until his abdication in 1622. He also ruled Baden-Baden. He was the third son of margrave Charles II of Baden-Durlach and his second wife, Anna of Veldenz. He was the youngest of eight children and was only four years old when his father died. He succeeded his brother Ernest Frederick as margrave in 1604. He also continued his brother's occupation of Baden-Baden. George Frederick was a prominent member of the Protestant Union. He raised an army of 12,000 men at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618. When Catholic League forces under General Tilly approached Baden in 1622 (Palatinate campaign), he marched against them, but came too late for the Battle of Mingolsheim. Setting off to pursue the retreating Catholics, he was defeated at the Battle of Wimpfen, and his army was destroyed, a few days later. In 1627 he joined the Danish army. He died at Strasbourg in 1638.

**Text:** ** Varoujan Hakhbandian , mostly known as Varoujan (Qazvin, 4 December 1936 - Tehran, 17 September 1977) was an Iranian songwriter, composer and arranger of Armenian descent. He has composed and written songs for Ebi, Googoosh, Dariush, and Farhad Mehrad. The music for the movie "Bar Faraaze Aasemaanha" (High in the Skies), composed shortly before his death, is one of his famous works. Varoujan Hakhbandian made songs for some films. As an example "The Dagger" and "The Beehive". Michael Davitt( 20 April 1950 – 19 June 2005) was an Irish poet who published in the Irish language. He has been characterised as" ... one of modern Ireland's finest poets in either of the nation's languages and key figure in the 1970s Irish Language poetry movement. Maximus of Tyre( fl. late 2nd century AD), also known as Cassius Maximus Tyrius, was a Greek rhetorician and philosopher who lived in the time of the Antonines and Commodus, and who belongs to the trend of the Second Sophistic. His writings contain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little reference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece, perhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is really an Eclectic and one of the precursors of Neoplatonism. Justin( century) was a Latin writer who lived under the Roman Empire. Fred H.

Robert Emmet Davitt( 12 December 1899 – 26 September 1981) was an Irish politician and medical practitioner. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Cumann na n Gaedheal Teachta Dála( TD) for the Meath constituency at the 1933 general election. He did not contest the 1937 general election. He was a son of Michael Davitt. Carla King is a lecturer at St Patrick's College, Dublin and an author in Irish history. According to Diarmaid Ferriter, she is" peerless in her expertise on Michael Davitt". Michael Davitt( 25 March 184630 May 1906) was an Irish republican activist for a variety of causes, especially Home Rule and land reform. Following an eviction when he was four years old, Davitt's family emigrated to England. He began his career as an organizer of the physical- force Irish Republican Brotherhood. Convicted of treason felony for arms trafficking in 1870, he served seven years in prison. Upon his release, Davitt pioneered the New Departure strategy of cooperation between the physical- force and constitutional wings of Irish nationalism on the issue of land reform. With Charles Stewart Parnell, he co-founded the Irish National Land League in 1879, in which capacity he enjoyed the peak of his influence before being jailed again in 1881. Davitt traveled widely, giving lectures around the world, supported himself through journalism, and served as Member of Parliament( MP) for the Irish Parliamentary Party( IPP) during the 1890s.

**Text:** Davitt traveled widely, giving lectures around the world, supported himself through journalism, and served as Member of Parliament( MP) for the Irish Parliamentary Party( IPP) during the 1890s. When the party split over Parnell's divorce, Davitt joined the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation. His Georgist views on the land question put him on the left wing of Irish nationalism, and he was a vociferous advocate of alliance between the Radical faction of the Liberal Party and the IPP.

Anne Denman( 1587–1661) was born in Olde Hall, Retford, Nottinghamshire. Through a fortunate second marriage with Thomas Aylesbury, she became the grandmother of Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York and great- grandmother of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne. Princess Ubol Ratana (born 5 April 1951) is a member of the Thai royal family. She is the eldest child of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. In 1972, she married American citizen Peter Ladd Jensen and settled in the United States, losing her royal title in the process. The couple divorced in 1998 whereupon she resumed her royal duties and position within the Thai court. She is styled in English as "Princess Ubol Ratana", without the style "Her Royal Highness". In 2001, she permanently returned to Thailand after a series of visits in the years following her divorce. Almost immediately, she began to fulfill her royal duties by taking part in many ceremonies. She started many charitable foundations that focused on improving the quality of life for the disadvantaged. In February 2019, in an "unprecedented" move, Ubol Ratana announced her candidacy for Prime Minister of Thailand in the 2019 general election, running as a candidate of the Thaksin-allied Thai Raksa Chart Party. Later that same day, her younger brother King Vajiralongkorn issued an emergency royal decree stating that her candidacy is "inappropriate" and "unconstitutional". Thailand’s election commission then disqualified her from running for prime minister, formally putting an end to her candidacy.

In 1978, Bojković was awarded Golden Arena for Best Actress in the Pula Film Festival for her role in the film" The Dog Who Loved Trains", and in 2003 she was the first laureate of Žanka Stokić Award. Ruggero Deodato( born 7 May 1939) is an Italian film director, and has also performed as both a screenwriter, and an actor in both his own and other projects. During his career, he has filmed in many different genres like peplum, comedy, drama, poliziottesco and science fiction, but he is best known for directing violent and gory horror films with strong elements of realism. He is famous for his 1980 film" Cannibal Holocaust", considered one of the most controversial and brutal in the history of cinema, which was seized, banned or heavily censored in many countries. It is also cited as a precursor of found footage films such as" The Blair Witch Project" and" The Last Broadcast". The film strengthened Deodato's fame as an" extreme" director and earned him the nickname" Monsieur Cannibal" in France. Deodato has been an influence on film directors like Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth.

**Text:** ** Snowman were a band originally from Perth, Western Australia. They relocated to London in 2008, and disbanded in 2011. Jessamine was an American post- rock band, that recorded three albums for Kranky records between 1994 and 1998, and a number of singles for other record labels. These singles were later collected by the band on a self- released compilation album in 1997 entitled" Another Fictionalized History". Their single" Cellophane" was a minor college radio hit in the band's native Seattle, getting frequent airplay on KCMU( now KEXP). The band's sound was influenced by the works of Krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, and their first album also bore some sonic resemblance to the sounds of early 1990s bands from the UK shoegaze scene. This mesh of krautrock, shoegaze, drone, space- rock, and experimental electronica helped the band forge a unique sound, which helped them stand apart from other active bands in the Seattle scene that were more grunge, metal, or indie- rock based. Their success in solidifying a unique sound however did not translate to album sales, and the band remained a relatively obscure act, with a small cult following. The band split in 1998, and Ritter and Brown recorded together as Fontanelle for a couple more years. Contra is a band from Cleveland. The Grapes were an American jam band and southern rock band band from Atlanta, who performed from 1986 to 1997. Anarchicks is a Portuguese Band from Greater Lisbon.

**Text:** ** Frank Mason Robinson( 1845 in Corinth, Maine – 1923 in Atlanta, Georgia), was an important early marketer and advertiser of what became known as Coca- Cola. Originally from Maine, as a young man he was in Iowa where he married Laura Clapp. During the winter of 1885, Robinson and his business partner, David Doe, came to the South in order to sell a machine they invented called a" chromatic printing device" which had the capability to produce two colors in one imprint. Upon arrival in Atlanta, Robinson and David Doe approached Dr. John S. Pemberton, a chemist and pharmacist, and struck a deal. In 1886 Frank Robinson officially settled in Atlanta where a new business was made called the Pemberton Chemical Company consisting of Robinson, Pemberton, David Doe and Pemberton's old partner, Ed Holland. Pemberton was experimenting with a medicinal formula which included coca leaves and kola nuts as sources of its ingredients. Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca- Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts. The name Coca- Cola was also chosen" because it was euphonious, and on account of my familiarity with such names as' S.S.S; and' B. B.B'" said Robinson himself. He was also responsible for writing the Coca- Cola name in Spencerian script which was popular with bookkeepers of the era and remains one of the most recognized trademarks in the world. The formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta. It sold the first year. The next year sales increased to.

**Text:** The formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta. It sold the first year. The next year sales increased to. In 1888 Pemberton sold the formula to Asa G. Candler, another Atlanta pharmacist and businessman, for a total investment of$ 2,300 before Pemberton died. Coca- Cola was granted a charter in 1892 and became the official Georgia Corporation named the Coca- Cola Company with Asa G. Candler, his brother John S. Candler, Frank M. Robinson and two other associates. Robinson served as treasurer and secretary and changed the Coca- Cola syrup formula so as not to include any faint traces of cocaine by the time of the Pure Food and Drug Act initiated by the Federal Government in 1906. The starting capitalization for the company was at$ 100,000. Robinson overall was responsible for the early advertising of Coca- Cola before and after Candler bought the name and syrup formula from Pemberton, the first ads appearing in" The Atlanta Journal" in 1887. While still working with Pemberton, Robinson had the initial ads display short phrases such as" Coca- Cola! Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating! The new and popular soda fountain drink containing the properties of the wonderful Coca plant and the famous Cola nut." Marketing for the drink showed the syrup beverage with medicinal properties curing headaches but with a unique taste. The initial ads distributed invited citizens to try" the new and popular soda fountain drink." Hand painted oil cloth signs were put outside stores displaying the Coca- Cola brand name with catchy words such as" Drink" in order to inform customers and other people passing by about the new medicinal beverage that was also a soda fountain drink. First year sales showed an average of nine bottles sold per day.

In" The Columbus Enquirer- Sun" a newspaper founded in 1874, published an article in 1906 praising Robinson's work with Coca- Cola:" there is one person to whom particular credit is due for the fact that the Coca- Cola formula remained, in the hands of the Georgians, and the further fact that the drink soon became so popular. He is Mr. Robinson, and the present secretary of the Coca- Cola Company ... In developing the drink, Mr. Robinson has also developed. He is said to be one of the best posted experts on advertising in America today, all due to his experience in advertising and pushing Coca- Cola." Regarding his personal life Robinson had a home in Druid Hills, an early suburb of Atlanta. He also had a country home on the Cobb County banks of the Chattahoochee River. The property had been a southern fortification defending the railroad bridge. The property is currently the Frank Mason Robinson Nature Preserve.

**Text:** As the leading soldier in the Dutch wars against Spain, his main achievement was the successful Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629. It was the main Spanish base and a well-fortified city protected by an experienced Spanish garrison and by formidable water defenses. His strategy was the successful neutralization of the threat of inundation of the area around 's-Hertogenbosch and his capture of the Spanish storehouse at Wesel. Prince Frederick William of Solms- Braunfels( 22 October 1770 in Braunfels – 13 April 1814 in Slawentzitz) was a Prussian Major General. He was the fourth son of Ferdinand William Ernest, 2nd Prince of Solms- Braunfels( 1721 – 1783) and Countess Sophie Christine Wilhelmine of Solms- Laubach( 1741 – 1772). He became known mainly through his marriage to Princess Frederica of Mecklenburg- Strelitz. She was the widow of Prince Louis Charles of Prussia( 1773 – 1796). When she became pregnant in 1798, he married her in order to avoid a scandal. The daughter died soon after birth. Frederick William was alleged to have been strongly inclined to consume alcohol and had to quit military service in 1805 for health reasons. He also lost his income and even his brother advised Frederica to divorce. She was initially against it, but when in 1813, she met Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover( 1771 – 1851), she, too, wanted the divorce. Before they got around to it, however, Frederick William died, in 1814 in Sławięcice.

Punks is a 2000 film produced by Babyface, directed by Patrik-Ian Polk, and starring Rockmond Dunbar, Seth Gilliam, Renoly Santiago, Jazzmun, and Dwight Ewell. The film follows the trials and tribulations of a group of gay African American friends. While black gay life is explored in the film, universal aspects of friendship plays at the plot's forefront. The film's themes were later used for the 2005 Logo cable television series "Noah's Arc". The film was popular at film festivals but never had distribution due to rights issues with the Sister Sledge songs featured prominently in the story. It was shown on Logo on August 7, 2011. Otherwise it remains unavailable through home media but has occasional private screenings. Patrik-Ian Polk (born July 29, 1973 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi) is an American director, screenwriter, and producer. Polk, who is openly gay, is noted for his films and theatre work that explore the experiences and stories of African-American LGBT people. In 2016, Polk was included in the "Los Angeles Times" Diverse 100 list, which described him as "the man bringing black gay stories to screens large and small".

Isabella died in 1879, aged 76, and was buried with her husband in the Cecil family chapel at St Martin's Church, Stamford. Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour (29 April 1759 – 11 September 1801) was a senior British Royal Navy officer of the late 18th century who was the fifth son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford and became known for being both a prominent society figure and a highly competent naval officer. He served during the American Revolutionary and French Revolutionary Wars and later in his career performed a period of shore duty on the Admiralty board. Seymour maintained a reputation as a courageous and innovative officer: he was awarded a commemorative medal for his actions at the battle of the Glorious First of June and is credited with introducing epaulettes to Royal Navy uniforms as a method of indicating rank to non-English speaking allies. In his youth he formed close personal friendships with fellow officer John Willett Payne and George, Prince of Wales, through association with whom he gained a reputation as a rake. His marriage in 1785, made at the insistence of his family as an antidote to his dissolution, was brought about through royal connections and proved very successful.

**Text:** Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui province. After some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu "to enquire about ding in the central plains", i.e. to have great ambitions (see the entry at wiktionary.) In the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin. His progress from lazy regent to hegemon gave rise to the Chinese chengyu "amaze [others] with one cry" (see the entry at wiktionary). The virus genus "Mivirus" is named in his honor. King Cheng of Chu( died 626 BC) was from 671 to 626 BC king of the state of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. He was born Xiong Yun to King Wen of Chu, and King Cheng was his posthumous title. In 672 BC Xiong Yun's older brother king Du'ao tried to kill him, and he escaped to the state of Sui. He then attacked and killed Du'ao with the help of Sui, and succeeded Du'ao as king of Chu. In the summer of 648 BC, the State of Huang was annexed by the state of Chu. King Cheng's wife was Zheng Mao. Their son was possibly King Mu of Chu. King Píng of Chu (died 516 BC).

She was the daughter of Thomas Panton of Newmarket( 1697- 1782), who was an equerry to King George II and master of the Thurlow Hunt, and his wife Priscilla( though she may have been illegitimate).

In 1757, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted the couple, and another portrait by Reynolds of the duchess was painted between 1765 and 1771. A watercolour miniature, by John Smart, dating to 1763, is held by the Nelson- Atkins Museum of Art.

On the birth of the future King William IV of the United Kingdom, the duchess recommended as wet- nurse a woman called Sarah Tuting, who was later acknowledged as her father's mistress.

**Text:** On 17 March 1780, however, the abeyance of the barony was terminated in Priscilla's favour, as the elder sister. The office of Lord Great Chamberlain remains divided. Albemarle Bertie( c. 1668–1742), of Swinstead, Lincolnshire, was an English Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1705 and 1741. Bertie was the fifth son of Robert Bertie, 3rd Earl of Lindsey and his wife Elizabeth Wharton. Bertie successfully contested Lincolnshire for the Whigs at the 1705 English general election. At the 1708 British general election, he stood down at Lincolnshire to make way for his nephew, Lord Willoughby de Eresby and was returned instead for Cockermouth on the interest of his uncle, the 1st Earl of Wharton. He was probably the candidate put up by the Wharton interest at Appleby at the 1710 British general election, who withdrew before the poll expressing a desire to sit no longer in Parliament. Bertie stood for Lincolnshire again at a by-election in 1721, but was defeated. At the 1734 British general election, he was returned for Boston by his nephew, now the 2nd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, but stood down again at the 1741 British general election and died the following year.

**Text:** His reign represented the height of the Mughal architecture, most notably the Taj Mahal. His relationship with his wife Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature, and cinema. Shah Jahan was widely considered the most competent of Emperor Jahangir's four sons and after Jahangir's death in late 1627, when a war of succession ensued, Shah Jahan emerged victorious. He put to death all of his rivals for the throne and crowned himself emperor in January 1628 in Agra under the regnal title "Shah Jahan" (which was originally given to him as a princely title). Although an able military commander, Shah Jahan is perhaps best remembered for his architectural achievements. The period of his reign is widely considered the golden age of Mughal architecture. Shah Jahan commissioned many monuments, the best known of which is the Taj Mahal in Agra, which entombs his wife Mumtaz Mahal. In September 1657, Shah Jahan fell seriously ill. This set off a war of succession among his four sons in which his third son, Aurangzeb, emerged victorious. Shah Jahan recovered from his illness, but Aurangzeb put his father under house arrest in Agra Fort from July 1658 until his death in January 1666. On 31 July 1658, Aurangzeb crowned himself emperor under the title "Alamgir". The Mughal Empire reached the pinnacle of its glory during Shah Jahan's reign and he is widely considered to be one of the greatest Mughal emperors. Lyon Cohen( 1868–1937) was a Polish- born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer/ poet Leonard Cohen.

On November 26, 1976, he held a meeting in Washington D.C. with head of Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Fred Ikle, a meeting attended also by mayor Yoshitake Morotani of Nagasaki with the purpose of promoting US policy of nuclear disarmament. On November 30, the two mayors met US Permanent Representative to the UN William Scranton and conveyed the same message. The two mayors met UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim on December 3. Araki later described his meeting with Waldheim as follows: There we, as survivors, living witnesses, testified the true facts of our atomic bomb experiences, and we strongly appealed for the total abolition of nuclear weapons and the renunciation of war. To this appeal of ours, both Secretary- General Kurt Waldheim and President H.S. Amerasinghe of the General Assembly, representing the United Nations, respectively emphasized that the sufferings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are sufferings to be shared by the whole of mankind, and that a new concept of world order should be built from the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

**Text:** Alexandru Cristea( 1890 – 1942) was the composer of the music for" Limba Noastră", current national anthem of Moldova. John Beasley Smith (September 27, 1901 – May 14, 1968) was an American composer and big band musician. " That Lucky Old Sun", one of his better known works, was covered by many well-known artists. He often worked with Haven Gillespie and toured the nation with his group, "Beasley Smith and His Orchestra". Beasley Smith was born in McEwen, Tennessee. His parents were teachers. The family moved to Nashville when he was in elementary school. While in high school at Hume-Fogg in downtown Nashville, he formed an instrumental duo with fellow piano prodigy Francis Craig. They were later roommates at Vanderbilt University. Smith left college after two years to become a musician. He formed his first band around 1922, and by 1925 the Beasley Smith Orchestra was entertaining regularly at the Andrew Jackson Hotel in downtown Nashville. From 1927-1933, the group toured nationally. On October 5, 1925, both Smith and Craig performed with their bands during the opening-day broadcasts of radio station WSM. Wearying of the road, Smith accepted the job of music director at WSM in 1933. He starred on such radio shows as "Mr. Smith Goes to TownSunday Down South" and "Tin Pan Valley." Lead vocalists who worked with Smith's band during his heyday included Snooky Lanson, Dottie Dillard, Kitty Kallen, and Dinah Shore. When Nashville started to become a recording center in the 1940s, Smith and Owen Bradley were key figures in assembling musicians for studio sessions. Smith began to blossom as a songwriter in the 1940s.

Smith began to blossom as a songwriter in the 1940s. He and Owen Bradley co-wrote "Night Train to Memphis" with Marvin Hughes. Roy Acuff sang the original version in 1942, and the upbeat song has been recorded consistently ever since. Beasley Smith and Francis Craig co-wrote " Beg Your Pardon," and it became the 1948 follow-up hit to "Near You" for Craig's band. " That Lucky Old Sun" (1949), co-written with Haven Gillespie was a million-seller for Frankie Laine and is now considered a pop-music standard. In 1953, Smith left WSM to become the A&R director and musical arranger for Dot Records. He and Dot founder, Randy Wood, also incorporated the Randy-Smith Music Publishing Company.

**Text:** ** Dame Gracie Fields, (born Grace Stansfield; 9 January 189827 September 1979) was an English actress, singer and comedienne and star of both cinema and music hall. She spent the later part of her life on the isle of Capri, Italy. Fields was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for Services to Entertainment in 1938, and in 1979, seven months before her death, she was invested as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively).

**Text:** Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase" jus soli". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as" jus sanguinis"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's" country of birth". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's" place of birth" or" nationality at birth". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place.

**Text:** Rockefeller was a Republican who was often considered to be liberal, progressive, or moderate. In an agreement that was termed the Treaty of Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller persuaded Richard Nixon to alter the Republican Party platform just before the 1960 Republican Convention. In his time, liberals in the Republican Party were called "Rockefeller Republicans". As Governor of New York from 1959 to 1973, Rockefeller's achievements included the expansion of the State University of New York, efforts to protect the environment, the construction of the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza in Albany, increased facilities and personnel for medical care, and the creation of the New York State Council on the Arts. After unsuccessfully seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 1960, 1964 and 1968, Rockefeller was appointed vice president of the United States under President Gerald R. Ford, who ascended to the presidency following the August 1974 resignation of Richard Nixon. Rockefeller was the second vice president appointed to the position under the 25th Amendment, following Ford himself. Rockefeller was not placed on the 1976 Republican ticket with Ford. He retired from politics in 1977 and died two years later. As a businessman, Rockefeller was president and later chair of Rockefeller Center, Inc., and he formed the International Basic Economy Corporation in 1947. Rockefeller assembled a significant art collection and promoted public access to the arts. He served as trustee, treasurer, and president of the Museum of Modern Art, and founded the Museum of Primitive Art in 1954. In the area of philanthropy, he founded the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in 1940 with his four brothers and established the American International Association for Economic and Social Development in 1946.

He was born in Cardigan, Prince Edward Island becoming a potato grower, general merchant, produce dealer by career. His father was John Alexander Macdonald, a provincial politician then a federal Member of Parliament and Senator. The younger Macdonald served in World War II, commanding the Prince Edward Island Regiment. He was injured at Normandy on July 1944 and returned to Prince Edward Island. He won a seat at the 3rd Kings riding in a 1945 provincial by-election despite remaining in hospital recovering from his war injuries. He lost his riding in the 1947 provincial election, but returned to the provincial legislature in a 1951 election victory after which he became his party's whip and finance critic. As a merchant, Macdonald became J. A. MacDonald& Co. Ltd.'s President and was a director for Associated Shippers, Inc. He also served on various boards and associations. Macdonald was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada at King's riding in the 1957 general election and re-elected there in the 1958 election. Macdonald made two previous unsuccessful attempts to win a seat at King's in the 1949 and 1953 elections. Macdonald died at his home in Cardigan, Prince Edward Island on the morning of 4 January 1961, during his term in the 24th Parliament.

**Text:** ** Rev. John Westley( 1636 – 78) was an English nonconformist minister. He was the grandfather of John Wesley( founder of Methodism). Cuthwulf, also sometimes Cutha (fl. 592-648), was the third son of Cuthwine, and consequently a member of the House of Wessex. Although a member of the direct male line from Cynric to Egbert (see House of Wessex family tree), Cuthwulf was never king. He is said to have been born "circa" 592, and his death date is unknown. His brothers were Cynebald and Cedda; his son was Ceolwald of Wessex; nothing more of his life is known. Due to the similarity of his name to his father's name, and the shadowy nature of early Anglo-Saxon genealogies, it appears that he was often confused with his father Cuthwine. For example, Caedwalla was said to be the son of Cedda and the grandson of Cutha, where Cutha here presumably refers to Cuthwine, since Cedda is also said to be the brother of Cuthwulf. Cuthwine, born c. 565, was a member of the House of Wessex, the son of Ceawlin of Wessex. After the deposition of his father, Ceawlin, from the throne of Wessex in 592, he did not inherit the throne, which instead passed to his cousin, Ceol. Cuthwine went into exile for many decades, remaining a strong leader of the Saxons and passing on the royal line through his three sons. Henry Bryant( May 12, 1820 – February 2, 1867) was an American physician and naturalist. He was the grandfather of Henry Bryant Bigelow.

**Text:** ** La légion saute sur Kolwezi also known as" Operation Leopard" is a French war film directed by Raoul Coutard filmed in French Guiana. The script is based on the true story of the Battle of Kolwezi that happened in 1978. It was diligently described in a book of the same name by former 1 REP Captain Pierre Sergent. He published his book in 1979; the film came out in 1980. Raoul Coutard shot the film in a documentary style. The Appaloosa is an American horse breed best known for its colorful spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation( LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex. Artwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric cave paintings in Europe. Images of domesticated horses with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from Ancient Greece and Han dynasty China through the early modern period. In North America, the Nez Perce people of what today is the United States Pacific Northwest developed the original American breed. Settlers once referred to these spotted horses as the" Palouse horse", possibly after the Palouse River, which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into" Appaloosa".

**Text:** Settlers once referred to these spotted horses as the" Palouse horse", possibly after the Palouse River, which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into" Appaloosa". The Nez Perce lost most of their horses after the Nez Perce War in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades. A small number of dedicated breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the Appaloosa Horse Club( ApHC) was formed as the breed registry in 1938. The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the foundation bloodstock of the registry; its partially open stud book allows the addition of some Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse and Arabian blood. Today, the Appaloosa is one of the most popular breeds in the United States; it was named the official state horse of Idaho in 1975. It is best known as a stock horse used in a number of western riding disciplines, but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of equestrian activity. Appaloosas have been used in many movies; an Appaloosa is the mascot for the Florida State Seminoles. Appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds, including the Pony of the Americas, the Nez Perce Horse, and several gaited horse breeds. Miss Charity is a 1921 British silent romance film directed by Edwin J. Collins and starring Margery Meadows, Dick Webb and Joan Lockton. It was based on a novel by Keble Howard. The Appaloosa bean is a cultivar bean variety of the species" Phaseolus vulgaris".

**Text:** ** The Black Rock Tunnel is an active rail road tunnel of the old Reading Railroad. The 1835 tunnel was the third rail tunnel constructed in the United States, and is the third oldest still in use. The tunnel is also notable as being the first for which shafts were sunk during construction. The tunnel is cut through a hill in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States. The tunnel and line are now owned by Norfolk Southern as part of its Harrisburg Line. The Black Rock Tunnel was constructed between 1835 and 1837 and opened in 1838. W. Hasell Wilson was the resident engineer in charge. The tunnel was originally long, wide, and high. The tunnel passes below the top of the hill. A then- unique feature of the tunnel's construction was the sinking of six, diameter shafts, tangent to the tunnel cross section. These shafts were spaced at intervals to correct errors in the tunnel alignment. Construction of the tunnel cost an estimated$ 178,992. Noted local miner, geologist and palaentologist Charles M. Wheatley examined the rock excavated from the tunnel and identified many previously unknown fossilized species, some of which now bear his name. In 1858 and 1859 the Black Rock and Flat Rock Tunnels were widened to accommodate the wider rolling stock from the Lebanon Valley Branch. The spacing between the tracks was increased from to. The widening of the tunnel was the first project to employ electric detonation of multiple explosive charges. The northern end of the tunnel is high on a steep bank of the Schuylkill River so the rail line makes a dramatic transition from tunnel to bridge. The ends of the Black Rock Tunnel are located at and. The Tunnel du Bois Clair is a tunnel near Cluny, France.

The tunnel is closed during the winter months( mid-October through the end of March) to protect a colony of bats that live in the tunnel. The tunnel takes about 7 minutes to travel through by bike and around 20 minutes by foot. " Light at the End of the Tunnel" is a debut song recorded by American country music artist B. B. Watson. It was released in August 1991 as the first single and title track from the album" Light at the End of the Tunnel". The song reached# 23 on the" Billboard" Hot Country Singles& Tracks chart. The song was written by Kim Williams, Mack Williams and Richard Fagan. The Free Expression Tunnel is the longest, widest, and most heavily used pedestrian tunnel under the railroad tracks at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina (also goes under Yarbrough Drive). The special aspect of the tunnel is that anyone is permitted to decorate its walls, ceiling, and floor. The tunnel connects NCSU's North Campus with the Central Campus and provides the most direct route from The Brickyard to the Central Campus residence halls. Clubs, fraternities, sororities, and other organizations often paint the tunnel to promote events and amateur artists paint to express themselves and to promote freedom of speech. A retaining wall just outside the tunnel's south entrance is also open for free expression. The "service tunnel" itself was constructed in 1939 as a Public Works Administration project.

**Text:** A retaining wall just outside the tunnel's south entrance is also open for free expression. The "service tunnel" itself was constructed in 1939 as a Public Works Administration project. The tunnel was first painted in 1968, when it was painted red and white to celebrate the military veterans of North Carolina Fans of other universities' sports teams often come to the Free Expression Tunnel before and sometimes after big athletic events to paint the tunnel with their teams' athletic colors as part of a prank. Carolina Tar Heel fans have a long history of doing this prank as well as fans from East Carolina University. The tunnel is subject to flooding during massive torrential rains. Waters rose to a height of 60 inches after a storm in July 2003. For the Spring 2005-2006 semester, the Free Expression Tunnel was closed for repairs and the installation of handicap ramps. The tunnel reopened in the winter of 2006 with a re-dedication ceremony, which unveiled a new plaque at the tunnel's north entrance expressing the brief history of the tunnel and its purpose. Prior to the renovations, the space available for free expression was much larger at both ends. On November 5, 2008 racist, threatening graffiti directed at (then) President-elect Barack Obama was found in the tunnel. Because of the threats against Obama, the Secret Service was among those called to investigate. The four students responsible were identified, and admitted to the act, stating that it was protected by their First Amendment right to free speech; however the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP has called for their expulsion. Since February 2010, there has been an ongoing tradition of a weekly freestyle cypher, every Monday night around 11pm. Local artists and students alike gather at the tunnel to freestyle, beatbox, sing, play instruments, recite poetry, and network.

**Text:** ** John Benson Brooks( February 23, 1917, Houlton, Maine – November 13, 1999, New York City) was an American jazz pianist, songwriter, arranger, and composer. Brooks worked early in his career as an arranger for Randy Brooks, Les Brown, Boyd Raeburn, and Tommy Dorsey. He worked often with lyricists Eddie DeLange and Bob Russell in the 1940s; he and DeLange wrote the song" Just as Though You Were Here," a hit for Tommy Dorsey with Frank Sinatra as vocalist. He wrote" You Came a Long Way from St. Louis" with Bob Russell for Ray McKinley, released as a single in 1948. In 1956 Brooks worked with Zoot Sims and Al Cohn on a recording" Folk Jazz U.S.A." He became better- known as a composer during this time, and his works blend elements of folk music and dodecaphony with the idioms of modern jazz. In 1958 he composed a work entitled" Alabama Concerto" and assembled a cast of sidemen for a recording which included Cannonball Adderley, Art Farmer, Barry Galbraith, and Milt Hinton. The recording was eventually re-issued under Adderley's name. Brooks was a close friend of Gil Evans. Evans later recorded his works" Sirhan's Blues" and" Where Flamingos Fly"( the last co-written with Harold Courlander and Elthea Peale). Brooks and Courlander collaborated on a book of transcriptions of rural blues and spirituals in Alabama, which provided some of the inspiration for the" Alabama Concerto".

**Text:** She was involved in negotiations with the European Union and has actively sought integration of Serbia with the EU. Stefan Vladislav (– after 1264) was the King of Serbia from 1234 to 1243. He was the middle son of Stefan the First-Crowned of the Nemanjić dynasty, who ruled Serbia from 1196 to 1228. Radoslav, the eldest son of Stefan the First-Crowned, was ousted by the Serbian nobility due to increasing Epirote influence through his marriage alliance to Theodore Komnenos Doukas; Vladislav was appointed as his successor. During Vladislav's reign, his uncle Archbishop Sava went on a pilgrimage and died in Bulgaria while on his way home. Vladislav obtained the remains and buried them in the Mileševa monastery, which he had built intended to be his burial place. Serbia was politically aligned with Bulgaria at the time, since Vladislav was married to Beloslava, the daughter of Ivan Asen II. Vladislav secured Hum, a maritime province under attack by Hungarian crusaders. After the death of Ivan Asen II, there was unrest in Serbia. The Mongols, led by Kadan, invaded Hungary and devastated the Balkans, at which time the Serbian nobility rose up against Vladislav. In 1243, he abdicated in favour of his younger brother, but remained the ruler of Zeta. He was described as very energetic, reliable, and hot-tempered. The Serbian Orthodox Church venerates him as a saint on .

**Text:** ** Saint Ceolfrid( or Ceolfrith,; c. 642 – 716) was an Anglo- Saxon Christian abbot and saint. He is best known as the warden of Bede from the age of seven until his death in 716. He was the Abbot of Monkwearmouth- Jarrow Abbey, and a major contributor to the project to produce the Codex Amiatinus Bible. He died in Burgundy while en route to deliver a copy of the codex to Pope Gregory II in Rome. Gregory II the Martyrophile,( Armenian: Գրիգոր Բ. Վկայասէր), was the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church between 1066 and 1105. On the death of Khachig II the Byzantines had hoped to leave Armenia without a catholicos for good, part of an effort to subdue them as a people and assimilate them into the Greek rite. However, Mary the daughter of King Gagik- Abas of Kars was a favorite of Byzantine Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa and obtained through her influence the permission to fill the empty seat. A meeting of the clergy elected Gregory the Martyrophile, son of Gregorius Magistratus, as pontiff. Gregory had been engaged in literary pursuits from a young age, had been honored by the emperor as a Duke, and had succeeded his father on his death as governor of Mesopotamia. He had grown tired of the world and embraced a monastic life. On his election he changed his original name of Vahram to Gregory in honor of Gregory the Illuminator. His name the Martyrophile came from his having compiled the memoirs of Christian martyrs.

**Text:** On his election he changed his original name of Vahram to Gregory in honor of Gregory the Illuminator. His name the Martyrophile came from his having compiled the memoirs of Christian martyrs. The Byzantine army invaded again and Gregory abdicated in 1071 since he was unable to stave off these problems. He appointed a monk George Lorensis as his successor and retired to a mountain around Tarsus. He was still regarded by the Armenian people as pontiff however and they referred to him for advice. Lorensis was offended by this and took imprudent measures as a response, at which point the clergy met at Gregory's retreat and deposed Lorensis. He had reigned for two years and Gregory resumed the office officially. At this same time a monk named Sarkis exercised control in his local region as pontiff and was succeeded by Theodorus, but the Armenian Church considers neither these two nor Lorensis to be canon pontiffs. Shortly after regaining his position as pontiff around 1074, Gregory made a visit to Ani which at that point was in the hands of the Persians and resided there a few months. He then returned home and wrote a letter to Pope Gregory VII, who responded in a friendly manner. Gregory II traveled to Rome to visit the Pope who was very curious to learn about the Armenian church. After a few months, Gregory II then made pilgrimage to Jerusalem and then went to Memphis, Egypt where he lived for a year. He appointed a nephew of his, Gregorius, as prelate at Memphis and then finally returned home. With Gregory II living in Tarsus, the eastern Armenians considered themselves without a pontiff and obtained his sanction to elect his nephew, Parsegh bishop of Ani, as their pontiff.

**Text:** With Gregory II living in Tarsus, the eastern Armenians considered themselves without a pontiff and obtained his sanction to elect his nephew, Parsegh bishop of Ani, as their pontiff. Two years later, a prince who settled in Marash elected Paul, abbot of Varagavank, to be considered pontiff of the church in that region. This means there were now four pontiffs of the Armenian church: Gregory II in the region of Mount Tarsus, Parsegh his nephew in Ani for the eastern Armenians, the previously- mentioned Theodorus, and Paul in Marash. There was much enmity between them and the cause of much confusion. Paul saw this and decided to relinquish his seat and retire to his convent, at which time the nation at large recognized Gregory II alone as pontiff, with Parsegh as his deputy. In 1087 Parsegh deposed Theodorus and settled at Edessa. In 1103, after many requests, Gregory II finally accepted the invitation of Kogh Vasil to move his residence to Rapan, in the vicinity of the city of Cheson, to spend his last years. As he left his Tarsus monastery, he took with him wards Gregory III of Cilicia and Nerses IV the Graceful, in whom he recognized future greatness. He entrusted the two preteens to the care of his nephew and deputy Parsegh as well as to his host Kogh Vasil, and stated that on his death Parsegh should be made Catholicos and after him should follow young Gregory. He died shortly after and was buried there at the red convent at Rapan near Cheson. Basil of Ani or Basil Pahlavuni (died 13 November 1113 AD) was Armenian Catholicos of Cilicia from 1105 to 1113, and nephew of Gregory II.

**Text:** Basil of Ani or Basil Pahlavuni (died 13 November 1113 AD) was Armenian Catholicos of Cilicia from 1105 to 1113, and nephew of Gregory II. Catholicos Gregory II had moved to Tarsus, far from the center of Armenian civilization for the past many centuries, so the eastern Armenians considered themselves without a pontiff. Gregory had previously visited Ani and set up his nephew Parsegh as bishop there, and so later they gained Gregory's sanction to elect Parsegh their pontiff. Around this time two other rivals named themselves pontiff of their own regions: Theodorus and one named Paul in Marash. There was much enmity between them and much confusion among the people. Paul saw this and decided to relinquish his seat and retire to his convent, at which time the nation at large recognized Gregory II alone as pontiff, with Parsegh as his deputy. In 1087 Parsegh deposed Theodorus and settled at Edessa. In 1103, after many requests, Gregory II finally accepted the invitation of Basilius the Crafty, lord of Marash and Kesoun, to move his residence to Rapan, near Kesoun, to spend his last years. Gregory II took with him his wards Gregory III of Cilicia and Nerses IV the Graceful, in whom he recognized future greatness. He entrusted the two boys to the care of his nephew and deputy Parsegh and his host Basilius, and stated that on his death Parsegh should be made Catholicos to be followed by Gregory. Parsegh succeeded Gregory II two years later, in 1105. Parsegh had his seat sometimes in the Red Convent in the desert of Shughr and sometimes in the city of Edessa.

**Text:** Parsegh succeeded Gregory II two years later, in 1105. Parsegh had his seat sometimes in the Red Convent in the desert of Shughr and sometimes in the city of Edessa. He saw to the education of Gregory and Nerses, and soon ordained Gregory a priest. During this period the Persians invaded Cilicia but were defeated by the forces of Basilius. Two years later though Cilicia was once again invaded, this time by Scythians. In 1111, they attacked the fortress of Zovk, held by Gregory and Nerses's father Apirat Pahlavi, grandson of Gregorius Magistratus, who was killed. Parsegh died in the Red Convent after being pontiff for thirty-one years, eight of those as sole ruler of the Armenian Church. Based on Gregory II's wishes, Gregory the son of Apirat was elected Catholicos at the Red Convent, only twenty years old. Tiberius Petasius was a Byzantine usurper in Italy around 729 and 730. Nothing is known of his early life, but judging from his Latin name" Petasius"( little felt sun- hat) he was a native of Italy. He claimed imperial power around 729 when large parts of Italy and rest of the empire rebelled against the Iconoclastic policies of Emperor Leo III, who had been excommunicated by Pope Gregory II. He may have been chosen by local Italian assemblies with the intention eventually taking power in Constantinople, but failed uprisings in Greece seem to have disheartened the courage of the Italians with the issue. His power seems to have been centered on the area of Rome, but nothing else is known of his short stay in power.

Tiberius Petasius' power came to an end sometime in 730 when he was defeated by Exarch of Ravenna Eutychius with support of Pope Gregory II and killed in Monterano, with his head sent to Leo III as a gift. Elsa Herrmann Pick( born Elsa Herrmann, January 9, 1893 – March 23, 1957, also known as Dr. Elsa Pickova) was a Jewish German feminist writer and refugee advocate. She is best known for her 1929 book" This is the New WomanSo ist die neue Frau" in the original German). Patriarch Gregory II Youssef, also known as Gregory II Hanna Youssef- Sayour( October 17, 1823 – July 13, 1897), was Patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church from 1864 to 1897. Gregory expanded and modernized the church and its institutions and participated in the First Vatican Council, where he championed the rights of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Gregory is remembered as a particularly dynamic patriarch of the Melkite Church. He is recognized as one of the forerunners of interconfessional dialogue and as an advocate for preserving the traditions and autonomy of the Melkites. Pope Gregory II( 669 – 11 February 731) was Bishop of Rome from 19 May 715 to his death in 731. His defiance of the Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian as a result of the iconoclastic controversy in the Eastern Empire prepared the way for a long series of revolts, schisms and civil wars that eventually led to the establishment of the temporal power of the popes.

Since his first-aired comedy song in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums , recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and performed more than 1,000 live shows. His works have earned him five Grammy Awards and a further eleven nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten "Billboard" album ("Straight Outta Lynwood") and single ("White & Nerdy") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, "Mandatory Fun" (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.

**Text:** His latest album, "Mandatory Fun" (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week. Yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music video to further parody popular culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including Ben Folds, Hanson, The Black Crowes, and The Presidents of the United States of America. With the decline of music television and the onset of social media, Yankovic used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy proved integral, helping to boost sales of his later albums, including "Mandatory Fun". Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles and EPs following on this success. In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film "UHF" (1989) and the television series "The Weird Al Show" (1997). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in "Al TV" specials on MTV. He has also written two children's books, "When I Grow Up" and "My New Teacher and Me!". Caspar Babypants is the stage name of children's music artist Chris Ballew, who is also widely known as the singer of The Presidents of the United States of America. Billy Milano is a Bronx- born heavy metal musician now based in Austin, Texas. He is the singer and- occasionally- guitarist and bassist of crossover thrash band M.O.D., and he was also the singer of its predecessor, Stormtroopers of Death. He was also the singer of United Forces, which also featured his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker.

**Text:** He was also the singer of United Forces, which also featured his Stormtroopers of Death bandmate Dan Lilker. "Yoda" is a song by "Weird Al" Yankovic from his third album, "Dare to Be Stupid" (1985). It is a parody of the song "Lola" by the Kinks. Inspired by the events of the movie "The Empire Strikes Back", the song is told from the point of view of Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker, and concerns his dealings with Master Yoda on the planet Dagobah. The song was initially written and recorded in 1980, during the original release of "The Empire Strikes Back", and achieved success on "The Dr. Demento Show"; however, securing permission from both "Star Wars" creator George Lucas and "Lola" songwriter Ray Davies delayed the physical release of the song for about five years. "Yoda" was never released as a single, and no music video was ever made for it. Nevertheless, the parody has gone on to be one of Yankovic's most famous songs. It was re-released twice in 1994: on his second greatest hits set and the box set , and also on the 2009 compilation "The Essential "Weird Al" Yankovic". The song is also a staple during Yankovic's live shows, and an idiosyncratic chant dubbed "The Yoda Chant" is often performed during the song's middle portions. Bernard Bonvoisin, known as Bernie Bonvoisin( born 9 July 1956 in Nanterre, Hauts- de- Seine), is a French hard rock singer and film director. He is best known for having been the singer of Trust.

**Text:** ** The Ancient Egyptian artisan Sennedjem lived in Set Maat( translated as" The Place of Truth"), contemporary Deir el- Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes, during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. Sennedjem had the title" Servant in the Place of Truth". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, in it there was regular furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he actually used when he was alive. His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs. " Where Was I?" may refer to: In Switzerland, the place of origin( literally" home place" or" citizen place") denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances. Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group. Motherland may also refer to: Roger Mortimer, 3rd Baron Mortimer, 1st Earl of March (25 April 128729 November 1330), was an English nobleman and powerful Marcher lord who gained many estates in the Welsh Marches and Ireland following his advantageous marriage to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, 2nd Baroness Geneville.

**Text:** In November 1316, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 for having led the Marcher lords in a revolt against King Edward II in what became known as the Despenser War. He later escaped to France, where he was joined by Edward's queen consort Isabella, whom he may have taken as his mistress. After he and Isabella led a successful invasion and rebellion, Edward was deposed; Mortimer allegedly arranged his murder at Berkeley Castle. For three years, Mortimer was "de facto" ruler of England before being himself overthrown by Edward's eldest son, Edward III. Accused of assuming royal power and other crimes, Mortimer was executed by hanging at Tyburn. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has" sovereignty" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of" födelsehemortdomicile of birth") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.

**Text:** ** A Vanished World( German: Eine versunkene Welt) is a 1922 Austrian silent adventure film directed by Alexander Korda and starring Alberto Capozzi, Victor Varconi, María Corda and Olga Lewinsky. It was based on the novel" Serpoletto" by Lajos Bíró. A Habsburg archduke enlists as an ordinary seamen. The film won the Gold Medal for Best Dramatic Film at the Milan International Cinema Concourse. Cecil Blount DeMille( August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker. Between 1914 and 1958, he made a total of 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of the American cinema and the most commercially successful producer- director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films were more diverse in genre, among which included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. De Mille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film," The Squaw Man"( 1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic," The Ten Commandments"( 1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty- five years.

Round table is a form of academic discussion. Participants agree on a specific topic to discuss and debate. Each person is given equal right to participate, as illustrated by the idea of a circular layout referred to in the term round table. Round- table discussions, together with houses of hospitality and agronomic universities, is one of the key elements of the Catholic Worker Movement, as formulated by Peter Maurin, one of the co-founders of the movement. Round table discussions are also a common feature of political talk shows. Talk shows such as" Washington Week" and" Meet the Press" have roundtables of reporters or pundits. Most of these are done around a table in a studio, but occasionally they report in split- screen from remote locations. Some sports shows, such as ESPN's" Around the Horn", employ the round table format. The round table method is still highly used to this day. Kids of the Round Table is a 1995 Canadian/ American fantasy film written and directed by Robert Tinnell. Malcolm McDowell, Michael Ironside and newcomer Johnny Morina star in a modern- day adventure filled with medieval magic.

**Text:** Malcolm McDowell, Michael Ironside and newcomer Johnny Morina star in a modern- day adventure filled with medieval magic. A round table is a table which has no" head" and no" sides", and therefore no one person sitting at it is given a privileged position and all are treated as equals. The idea stems from the Arthurian legend about the Knights of the Round Table in Camelot. Today, round tables are often used at conferences involving many parties. The most famous modern round table was the one used for talks between the Communist government and Solidarity in Poland in 1989; see: Polish Round Table Agreement. Hence, the term" round table" is also used figuratively to refer to a peaceful way of achieving a compromise solution. Round table primarily refers to the Central Round Table(" Zentraler Runder Tisch"), a series of meetings during the Peaceful Revolution in East Germany in late- 1989 and early- 1990. The Round table first convened in East Berlin on 7 December 1989, the day after Egon Krenz had resigned as the head of the Socialist Unity Party( SED) government. This Round Table, modeled after the Polish Round Table convened in April 1989, was initiated by the group Democracy Now. " Round table" was to be understood in a methaphoric sense, meaning that the participants were on a par with each other. Physically, the table was rectangular( unlike the Polish model which was literally round). It was set up as a forum in which members of East German government- aligned organizations( such as the so- called bloc parties, trade unions, etc.) came together with representatives of the new citizens ’ movements( such as Democracy Now, Democratic Awakening, and New Forum) to discuss and advance reforms in the German Democratic Republic( East Germany), advising the executive until free elections could be held.

**Text:** came together with representatives of the new citizens ’ movements( such as Democracy Now, Democratic Awakening, and New Forum) to discuss and advance reforms in the German Democratic Republic( East Germany), advising the executive until free elections could be held. There were 39 representatives at the Central Round Table, 33 of whom were entitled to vote. Seventeen of them represented new oppositional groups and political parties, and sixteen were from political parties and organizations that had been part of the communist- dominated East German government. Three, representing women, consumers and environmentalists, had observer status. The final three members were the moderators, all clergymen, from the Protestant, Catholic and Methodist churches, who did not have a vote. At first most participants hoped to reform the East German government and thus retain the country ’s independence, but as popular opinion moved towards rapid unification with West Germany, these hopes were dashed. The Round Table's first three meetings, held on 7, 18 and 22 December 1989, took place in the Protestant church's Bonhoeffer House near Friedrichstraße in Berlin- Mitte. Because popular interest created a need for more space, from the fourth meeting on 27 December to the sixteenth and final meeting on 12 March 1990, the Round Table met in the conference building of the SED- dominated Council of Ministers in Ossietzky St. near Schönhausen Palace in Berlin- Pankow.

Christopher Maurice Brown (born May 5, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter and dancer. Born in Tappahannock, Virginia, he was involved in his church choir and several local talent shows from a young age. Having signed with Jive Records in 2004, Brown released his self-titled debut studio album the following year, which became certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

His second album "Exclusive" (2007) spawned his second "Billboard" Hot 100 number one "Kiss Kiss". In addition to his solo commercial success, Brown has been featured on several successful singles such as "No Air", a duet with singer Jordin Sparks, "Shortie Like Mine" with the rapper Bow Wow and "Shawty Get Loose" alongside Lil Mama and T-Pain.

He had no children, so his title reverted to his father and his wife later married John Leveson- Gower, 1st Earl Gower.

**Text:** John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet (15 December 1608 – 7 May 1664) was an English nobleman and supporter of Charles I of England. He was the eldest son of Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet and Lady Frances Cecil granddaughter of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. On 21 April 1629, he married Lady Margaret Sackville (1614–1676), daughter of Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset and Lady Anne Clifford. They had eleven children: Thanet was a staunch Cavalier, and in 1642 led a regiment to try to raise a rebellion in Sussex in support of Sir William Brockman in Kent. However, Brockman's revolt quickly collapsed and the Earl was forced to surrender. He suffered considerably from confiscations and sequestrations of his large estates during the English Civil War. Among his properties was Bodiam Castle, purchased from the Levett family in 1639, which Thanet sold for £6,000 in 1644. Curiously, he was succeeded as Earl of Thanet by four of his sons in succession, the first three having no issue.

Bernard Bonvoisin, known as Bernie Bonvoisin( born 9 July 1956 in Nanterre, Hauts- de- Seine), is a French hard rock singer and film director. He is best known for having been the singer of Trust. He was one of the best friends of Bon Scott the singer of AC/ DC and together they recorded the song" Ride On" which was one of the last songs by Bon Scott. "Hard Day" is a song by English singer George Michael from his debut studio album, "Faith" (1987). It was released on 30 October 1987 as the album's third single. The song was written and originally produced by Michael, and was released solely in the United States and Australia. No music video was made for the song. The lyrics are apparently addressed to a woman which the singer is obsessed with; in the final verse, Michael voices her by altering his own voice, in the same style as Prince's imaginary alter ego Camille. "Hard Day" reached the top five on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and the top 40 on the US Hot R&B/ Hip-Hop Songs chart. The 12" single was backed with the extended mix of "I Want Your SexHard Day" was also released as the B-side of the earlier "I Want Your Sex" 12" single.

He was the son of James Cecil, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and his wife, Anne Cecil, Countess of Salisbury. He was known for his irregular life as" the Wicked Earl". He was educated at Westminster School, was High Steward of Hertford, and a Governor of the Foundling Hospital of London. He married in 1745 Elizabeth( 1721 – 1776), daughter of Edward Keet of Canterbury, said by a contemporary source to have been a barber and a tourist guide. However, within a few years he separated from his Countess and lived as a recluse with his mistress, one Mrs. Mary Grave of Baldock, for the remaining 30 years of his life at Quickswood, in the parish of Clothall. His relationship with her predated his marriage. C. Price wrote of the liaison in 1771( Hatfield House archives): “ He lives upstairs ... surrounded with old trunks and boxes and scattered books. Well or ill he never quits his chamber, never sees or converses with any but his old Dame, as he calls her, and his physician, who occasionally visits him. The servants are old and rusty like the dwelling.

**Text:** ** Abd Al- Aziz Fawzan Al- Fawzan( Arabic: فوزان، عبد العزيز بن فوزان بن صالح) is an Islamic scholar and author in Saudi Arabia. He is also known as" Abd al- Aziz b. Fawzan al- Fawzan Abd Al- Aziz Al- Fawzan". Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (circa 674 – 23 February 715), commonly known as al-Walid I , was the sixth Umayyad caliph, ruling from October 705 until his death. Al-Walid was the eldest son of his predecessor Caliph Abd al-Malik . While still a prince, he led annual raids against the Byzantines in 695–698 and built or restored fortifications along the Syrian Desert route to Mecca. He became the heir apparent after the death of Abd al-Malik's brother and designated successor, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, in 704. Al-Walid largely continued his father's policies of centralization and expansion, and heavily depended on al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, his father's powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. During his reign, Umayyad armies conquered the Maghreb, Hispania, Sind and Transoxiana, expanding the Caliphate to its largest territorial extent. War spoils from the conquests allowed al-Walid to finance public works of great magnitude, including the Great Mosque of Damascus, the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. He was the first caliph to institute programs for social welfare, aiding the poor and handicapped in Syria.

**Text:** He was the first caliph to institute programs for social welfare, aiding the poor and handicapped in Syria. Though it is difficult to ascertain al-Walid's direct role in the affairs of his caliphate, his reign was marked by domestic peace and prosperity and likely represented the peak of Umayyad power. Abd al- Aziz ibn Nuh( died 10th- century) was amir of the Samanids briefly in 992. He was the son of Nuh I. In 992, the Karakhanids under Bughra Khan invaded the domains of amir Nuh II, and briefly wrested Bukhara from Samanid control. However, during his stay in Bukhara, Bughra Khan fell sick, and in order to ensure that the city remained under Karakhanid control, he installed Nuh's uncle Abd al- Aziz as the Samanid ruler, effectively as a Karakhanid puppet. Bughra Khan then left Bukhara for Samarkand, but died before he reached the city. Nuh quickly used the opportunity to reconquer Bukhara, and had Abd al- Aziz blinded and imprisoned. After the event, Abd al- Aziz disappeared from sources, and probably died some years later.

He made acquaintance of the governor Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan and the caliphs Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz and Yazid II.

**Text:** He was appointed by his father, Caliph Marwan I( r. 684–685). Abd al- Aziz's reign was marked by stability and prosperity, partly due to his close relations and reliance on the Arab military settlers of Fustat. Under his direction and supervision, an army led by Musa ibn Nusayr completed the Muslim conquest of North Africa. He was removed from the line of succession to the caliphal throne and, in any case, died before his brother, Caliph Abd al- Malik. However, one of Abd al- Aziz's sons, Umar II, would become caliph in 717–720. Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Walid (died 728/9) was a member of the Umayyad dynasty and a military leader in the wars against the Byzantine Empire during the reign of his father, Caliph al-Walid I (reigned 705–715). The latter also appointed Abd al-Aziz governor of Jund Dimashq (District of Damascus). Abd al-Aziz's mother was Umm al-Banin, a daughter of al-Walid's paternal uncle, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan. He was regarded by his father as "the "sayyid", the most forceful personality, amongst his sons". Abd al-Aziz led his first campaign against the Byzantines in Asia Minor in 709, when he captured a fortress, although his uncle Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik led the main raid of the year afterwards. In 710 he led the main Umayyad attack, although under the auspices of Maslama as commander-in-chief for the Byzantine front, and in 713 he led an attack against the frontier fortress of Gazelon.

In 714/15, his father attempted to reverse the succession arrangement, by which the throne would pass to his brother Sulayman, in favour of Abd al-Aziz. In addition to various officials and poets in al-Walid's court, Abd al-Aziz gained the support of the powerful viceroy of the eastern half of the Caliphate, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who died in 714, the governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, and a prominent Alid of Medina, Zayd, the son of Hasan ibn Ali. Nonetheless, he was unable to impose his will. When Sulayman in turn died in northern Syria in 717, Abd al-Aziz intended to claim the throne in Damascus, but upon learning that his maternal uncle Umar II had been chosen as caliph, he presented himself before him and acknowledged his rule. According to the account of al-Waqidi, during their encounter, Umar informed Abd al-Aziz that he would not have disputed his accession, to which Abd al-Aziz replied: "I would not like anyone else but you to have taken over the office". Abd al-Aziz died in Anno Hegirae 110 (728/729 CE). Abd al- Aziz ibn Mansur was the ruler of the Hammadids from 1104 to 1121.
