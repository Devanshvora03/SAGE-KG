He wrote fundamental works in applied celestial mechanics, spaceflight dynamics and robotics. On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, supports, space ballistics pioneer in ussr)\n- (space ballistics pioneer in ussr, includes, applied celestial mechanics)\n- (space ballistics pioneer in ussr, includes, spaceflight dynamics)\n- (space ballistics pioneer in ussr, includes, robotics)\n- (united states seventh fleet, dispatched_by, president truman on 27 june 1950 to taiwan strait)\n- (taiwan strait dispatch by united states seventh fleet, response_to, kpa invasion (two days prior))\n- (taiwan strait dispatch by united states seventh fleet, context, three months before chinese entry into the war)\n- (mao zedong, reported_to, politburo on 4 august 1950 about reorganizing pla's taiwan invasion force)\n- (reorganization of pla forces by mao zedong, justification_for_intervention_in_korea, american aggression in the guise of the un)\n- (trotsky, believed_that, revolution could succeed only as part of a world revolution)\n- (lenin, wrote_extensively_on, imperialism being the highest stage of capitalism)\n- (theoretical work by lenin on imperialism, influenced_policy_after_death_by, joseph stalin establishing socialism in one country for soviet union)\n- (nikita khrushchev, initiated_new_wave_of, anti-imperialist propaganda during thaw era (late 1950s))\n- (new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda by nikita khrushchev, put_pressure_on, soviet-american relations)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.

This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado, released The BCCI Affair, a report on the BCCI scandal.

The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama.

Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia, but, failing to win a single state other than South Carolina, chose to withdraw from the presidential race. Sharpton followed suit a couple weeks later. Kuninch did not leave the race officially until July. In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.

He made significant career progress through the court of King Vajiravudh, but left government office to work privately as the country was going through political change which abolished absolute monarchy and decreased government employment of foreigners. However, by adopting a Thai identity and way of life, marrying a Thai woman and settling down permanently, Manfredi remained a relevant and respected figure in Thai architecture, and later became a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University. His works include various royal residences and public institutions, ranging in style from Venetian Gothic to modernist, and incorporated Thai traditional styles as well. He contributed to much of Bangkok's architectural heritage, but no complete records of his works were kept. Controversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Leh to make it more ``paradise - like ''. The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (bang bon (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19), supports, bang khae)\n- (bang khae, is_neighbour_of, phasi charoen)\n- (bang bon (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19), supports, phasi charoen)\n- (bang bon (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19), supports, chom thong)\n- (chom thong, is_neighbour_of, krathum baen district)\n- (bang bon (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19), supports, krathum baen district)\n- (bang bon (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19), supports, mueang samut sakhon district)\n- (bang bon (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19), supports, nong khaem district)\n- (manfredi, requires, king vajiravudh (rama vi))\n- (manfredi, becomes_lecturer_at, chulalongkorn university)\n- (thai traditional architectural elements, are_incorporated_into, manfredi's works)\n- (fox, uses, ko phi phi leh for film production)\n- (fox, alters, sand dunes on ko phi phi leh)\n- (fox, clears, coconut trees and grass on ko phi phi leh to widen the beach)\n- (fox, sets_aside_fund_for, reconstruction of natural state after filming on ko phi phi leh)\n- (environmentalists, file_lawsuits_against, fox)\n- (manfredi's works, include, various royal residences)\n- (manfredi's works, include, public institutions)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. In 1963 Flexer moved to Canada settling in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he became involved in the anti-war movement protesting the Vietnam War and participated in the celebrated removal of Dow Chemical from the U of M campus. In 1968 he moved to Montreal. Following a brief stay in Israel in 1970, where he lived and worked on kibbutz Gan-Shmuel, he moved back to Canada and settled in Toronto in 1970. There he joined the Waffle, a radical socialist tendency within the New Democratic Party, becoming its provincial organizer in Ontario. Moving leftward, he helped form the Red Circle, a Marxist tendency within the Waffle. When the Waffle was forced out of the NDP in 1972, Flexer and the Red Circle split with the Waffle, opposing its decision to leave the NDP, and tried to continue Marxist activities within the NDP. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal.

(also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Sunman is an unreleased action video game developed by EIM and planned to be published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system\u2014the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's \"Ultra Games\" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (nintendo entertainment system (nes), is, 8-bit home video game console)\n- (nintendo entertainment system (nes), was_developed_by, nintendo)\n- (family computer (famicom), was_released_in, japan on july 15, 1983)\n- (nintendo entertainment system (nes), was_released_in, north america during 1985)\n- (nintendo entertainment system (nes), was_released_in, europe during 1986)\n- (nintendo entertainment system (nes), was_released_in, australia in 1987)\n- (hyundai comboy, is_version_of, nintendo entertainment system (nes))\n- (hyundai comboy, distributed_by, sk hynix (formerly hyundai electronics))\n- (super nintendo entertainment system, succeeded_by, nintendo entertainment system (nes))\n- (sunman, developed_by, eim)\n- (sunman, planned_to_be_published_by, sunsoft for the nes in 1992)\n- (nintendo entertainment system (nes), required_approval_from, nintendo)\n- (konami, released_games_under_name_of, ultra games to circumvent limit)\n- (acclaim, began_releasing_games_for_both, nintendo and sega platforms in 1991)\n- (capcom, licensed_some_games_to, sega instead of producing them directly)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (khong island, is_part_of, si phan don riverine archipelago)\n- (si phan don riverine archipelago, is_in, mekong river)\n- (si phan don riverine archipelago, is_in, khong district)\n- (si phan don riverine archipelago, is_in, champasak province)\n- (si phan don riverine archipelago, is_in, southern laos)\n- (myanmar, borders_with, china)\n- (myanmar, borders_with, india)\n- (myanmar, borders_with, bangladesh)\n- (myanmar, borders_with, thailand)\n- (myanmar, borders_with, laos)\n- (myanmar, lies_on, indian plate)\n- (myanmar, lies_on, eurasian plate)\n- (myanmar, is_south_east_of, himalayas)\n- (the bay of bengal, borders_my, western myanmar)\n- (the andaman sea, borders_my, southern myanmar)\n- (restored toungoo kings, established_kingdom_in, lower myanmar)\n- (restored toungoo kings, established_kingdom_in, upper myanmar)\n- (restored toungoo kings, established_kingdom_in, shan states)\n- (restored toungoo kings, established_kingdom_in, lan na)\n- (restored toungoo kings, established_kingdom_in, upper tenasserim)\n- (restored toungoo kings, created_framework, legal and political framework)\n- (legal and political framework, lasted_until, 19th century)\n- (crown, replaced_with, appointed governorships)\n- (appointed governorships, occurred_throughout, irrawaddy valley)\n- (hereditary rights of shan chiefs, diminished_significantly_under, restored toungoo kings)\n- (economic prosperity, achieved_through, trade and administrative reforms)\n- (trade and administrative reforms, lasted_over, 80 years)\n- (meithei raids, occurred_in, upper myanmar from 1720s)\n- (rebellion, took_place_in, lan na from 1720s)\n- (mon of lower myanmar, founded_kingdom_in, lower myanmar in 1740)\n- (hanthawaddy forces, sacked_city_in, ava in 1752)\n- (toungoo dynasty, ended_with, hanthawaddy sacking ava)\n- (western european states, discovered_routes_to_avoid, ottoman trade monopoly)\n- (the portuguese, discovered_the, cape of good hope in 1488)\n- (ottoman and portuguese, had_wars_during, 16th century due to new routes)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States. Roosevelt had served as president from 1901 to 1909, and Taft had won the 1908 Republican president nomination with Roosevelt's support. Displeased with Taft's actions as president, Roosevelt challenged Taft at the 1912 Republican National Convention. After Taft and his conservative allies narrowly prevailed at the Republican convention, Roosevelt rallied his progressive supporters and launched a third party bid. With the support of William Jennings Bryan and other progressives, Wilson won the Democratic Party's presidential nomination on the 46th ballot.

A decade after the 1973 oil crisis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan, affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints, opened US assembly plants and established their luxury divisions (Acura, Lexus and Infiniti, respectively) to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands. A facelift was designed through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801 - 0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year.

The bridge opened in 1967 and was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. It had a catastrophic failure during the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely cause of the collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and additional weight on the bridge at the time contributed to the catastrophic failure. Minneapolis is a city in and the county seat of Ottawa County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,032. The Merchants Bridge, officially the Merchants Memorial Mississippi Rail Bridge, is a rail bridge crossing the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and Venice, Illinois.

Some, such as the United Kingdom and Prussia (as the founder of the newly formed German state), experienced continued economic growth and political power. Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated. At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of industrialization. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: Italy after the Risorgimento, Japan after the Meiji Restoration, and the United States after its civil war. By the dawn of the 20th century, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna. The Eight-Nation Alliance was a belligerent alliance of eight nations against the Boxer Rebellion in China. It formed in 1900 and consisted of the five Congress powers plus Italy, Japan, and the United States, representing the great powers at the beginning of 20th century. The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the Belle E\u0301poque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (united kingdom, has_program, balance of power shift program)\n- (balance of power shift program, includes, economic growth and political power)\n- (balance of power shift program, targets, dawn of 20th century)\n- (prussia, has_program, balance of power shift program)\n- (russia, has_program, stagnation in power program)\n- (stagnation in power program, requires, power stagnation by dawn of 20th century)\n- (austria hungary, has_program, stagnation in power program)\n- (italy, seeks_to_attain, great power status after risorgimento)\n- (japan, seeks_to_attain, great power status after meiji restoration)\n- (united states, seeks_to_attain, great power status after civil war)\n- (eight nation alliance, has_program, belligerent alliance program)\n- (belligerent alliance program, includes, alliance against boxer rebellion in china)\n- (belligerent alliance program, forms_in, 1900)\n- (belligerent alliance program, consists_of, five congress powers plus italy japan and united states)\n- (tourism industry, has_program, development timeline program)\n- (development timeline program, begins_in, early 19th century when foreigners visit alps)\n- (development timeline program, includes, foreigners travel to bases of mountains for scenery)\n- (development timeline program, includes, foreigners stay at spa resorts during beginning)\n- (development timeline program, includes, large hotels built during belle epoque period)\n- (development timeline program, includes, cog railways built early in the 20th century to brings tourists to higher elevations)\n- (jungfraubahn, terminates_at, jungfraujoch above eternal snow line after tunnel through eiger)\n- (first figure skating championship, held_in, st moritz in 1882)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In 1928 Giannini merged his bank with Bank of America, Los Angeles, headed by Orra E. Monnette and consolidated it with other bank holdings to create what would become the largest banking institution in the country. Bank of Italy was renamed on November 3, 1930 to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, which was the only such designated bank in the United States of America at that time.

Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth. Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, Heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention -- possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (planetary geologists, has_program, earth measurement program)\n- (earth measurement program, targets, earth samples)\n- (planetary geologists, has_program, moon measurement program)\n- (moon measurement program, targets, moon samples)\n- (planetary geologists, has_program, mars measurement program)\n- (mars measurement program, targets, mars samples)\n- (planetary geologists, has_program, meteorite analysis program)\n- (meteorite analysis program, targets, meteorites)\n- (scientists, have_problem_with, obtaining reference values for sun isotope ratios)\n- (silicon wafer, exposed_to, solar wind)\n- (solar wind, affects_isotope_ratio_of, oxygen-16 in silicon wafer)\n- (sun, has_isotope_ratios_similar_to, primordial solar nebula)\n- (unknown process, depletes, oxygen-16 from protoplanetary material)\n- (protoplanetary material, undergoes_process_before_dust_grain_coalescence, oxygen-16 depletion)\n- (heliocentrism, opposed_by, geocentrism)\n- (geocentrism, places_at_center, earth)\n- (notion of earth revolution around sun, proposed_in_3rd_century_bc, aristarchus of samos)\n- (heliocentrism, received_little_attention_during, medieval world)\n- (loss of scientific works from hellenistic era, possibly_contributed_to, little attention to heliocentrism)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India.

Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities. Despite cost of living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities. The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the United States at that time, providing services denied to them by the existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (boston, has_program, intellectual center program)\n- (boston, has_program, technological center program)\n- (boston, has_program, political center program)\n- (fleetboston financial, supports, charlotte-based bank of america)\n- (charlotte-based bank of america, includes, acquisition of fleetboston financial)\n- (acquisition occurred on, date, october 17, 2004)\n- (jordan marsh, supports, macy's)\n- (filene's, supports, macy's)\n- (merger occurred in, period, 20th century latter half)\n- (boston, experienced, gentrification)\n- (gentrification occurred in, period, latter half of the 20th century)\n- (housing prices, increased_sharply_since, 1990s)\n- (living expenses, supports, high cost of living)\n- (high cost of living, includes, ranking among cities)\n- (boston ranked as, position, 129th most expensive major city globally)\n- (in a survey of 214 cities, boston was_ranked_as, position, 129th most expensive major city globally)\n- (boston, supports, quality of living)\n- (quality of living, includes, ranking among cities)\n- (ranking occurred in, year, 2011)\n- (history of bank of america, dates_back_to, october 17, 1904)\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, supports, founding of bank of italy)\n- (bank of italy, serves, needs of immigrants)\n- (founding occurred on, date, october 17, 1904)\n- (the bank of italy, served, needs of many immigrants)\n- (existing american banks, supported, discrimination against immigrants)\n- (giannini was raised by, mother_and_stepfather, lorenzo scatena)\n- (san francisco earthquake, supports, saving of deposits by giannini)\n- (saving occurred in, year, 1906)\n- (san francisco's banks, were_in_smoldering_ruins_and_unable_to_open_their_vaults_after, san francisco earthquake)\n- (giannini, supports, commencement of lending)\n- (lending occurred with, funds, rescued funds)\n- (commencement happened in, year, 1906)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets. Mandatory markets losing both CBC and Radio-Canada over-the-air signals include London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline. Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are \"CB\" (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is \"T\".\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (canadian broadcasters, has_program, digital television transition program)\n- (digital television transition program, has_deadline, august 31, 2011)\n- (cbc television stations, has_program, analogue to digital conversion program)\n- (analogue to digital conversion program, has_amount, half of transmitters)\n- (analogue to digital conversion program, targets, mandatory markets)\n- (t\u00e9l\u00e9vision de radio-canada stations, has_program, analogue to digital conversion program)\n- (canadian broadcasters, has_deadline, august 31, 2011)\n- (cbc television stations, reports_financial_difficulties, financial difficulties)\n- (cbc television stations, lacks_plan, digital transition plan for analogue retransmitters)\n- (digital transition plan for analogue retransmitters, targets, mandatory markets)\n- (communities, lose_signals, over-the-air signals)\n- (communities losing signals, context, mandatory markets)\n- (mandatory markets, has_transmitters, 48 transmitters)\n- (transmitters in mandatory markets, has_amount, 23 rebroadcast transmitters)\n- (london ontario, is_market_in, mandatory markets)\n- (london market, loses_signals, cbc and radio-canada over-the-air signals)\n- (saskatoon saskatchewan, is_market_in, mandatory markets)\n- (saskatoon market, loses_signals, cbc and radio-canada over-the-air signals)\n- (transmitters in mandatory markets, are_not_planned_to_convert, digital by deadline)\n- (cbc television stations, are_owned_and_operated_by, cbc itself)\n- (cbc o&o stations, operate_as, national service)\n- (national service, includes, few deviations from main network schedule)\n- (regional differences, occur_on, cbc o&o stations)\n- (occasional regional differences, include, specific programming variations)\n- (cbc television stations, use_branding, cbc brand)\n- (station branding, does_not_include, call letters)\n- (cbc television stations, identify_themselves, sign-on or sign-off)\n- (specific identification, occurs, during station id periods)\n- (toronto's cblt, identifies_itself, psip only)\n- (psip identification, is_used_for, digital transition information)\n- (cbc o&o stations, follow_convention, call letter naming convention)\n- (call letter naming convention, starts_with, cb)\n- (call letter naming convention, ends_with, t)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It sold at auction in 2002 for C$5.1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at that time. It was purchased by media magnate Ken Thomson, who donated it to the Art Gallery of Ontario. The painting depicts British explorer John Henry Lefroy on his successful expedition to map the Magnetic North Pole. A largely self-educated artist, Paul Kane grew up in Toronto (then known as York) and trained himself by copying European masters on a \"Grand Tour\" study trip through Europe. He undertook two voyages through the Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848. The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie and back. Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria. The Toronto Coach Terminal is the central bus station for inter-city services in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 610 Bay Street, in the city's Downtown. The terminal is owned by Toronto Coach Terminal Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC managed the station directly until July 8, 2012, when it was leased out in its entirety to bus lines Coach Canada and Greyhound Canada for $1.2 million annually. Opened in 1931 as the Gray Coach Terminal, the Art Deco style terminal was home base for Gray Coach, an interurban bus service then owned by the TTC.

Like adjacent Upper Lusatia in the south, Lower Lusatia is a settlement area of the West Slavic Sorbs whose endangered Lower Sorbian language is related to Upper Sorbian and Polish. In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the Roman Empire allowed different tribes of Central Europe (Suebi, Vandals and Alani) to cross the Rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi.

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. David Htan (; born 13 May 1990) is a burmese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Myanmar national football team and Shan United.

Ancestor worship and Confucianism are also widely practised in Vietnam and Singapore. Christianity is predominant in the Philippines, eastern Indonesia, East Malaysia and East Timor. The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia. East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule. The tentacled snake or tentacle snake (Erpeton tentaculatum), is a rear-fanged aquatic snake native to South-East Asia. It is the only species of its genus, Erpeton, and the two tentacles on its snout are a unique feature among snakes. The method it uses to catch fish has recently been a subject of research. According to recent estimates, 50% of the population adheres to Christianity, Islam 48%, while 2% of the population follows other religions including traditional African religion and animism. According to a study made by Pew Research Center, 63% adheres to Christianity and 36% adheres to Islam.

Apple's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS GUI. From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (trotsky, has_belief, world revolution)\n- (world revolution, requires, international cooperation)\n- (lenin, writes_about, imperialism)\n- (imperialism, is_stage_of, capitalism)\n- (stalin, establishes_policy, socialism in one country)\n- (socialism in one country, for_context, soviet union)\n- (internationalist elements, are_purged_by, stalin)\n- (internationalist tendencies, are_abandoned, early revolution)\n- (client states, compete_with, americans during cold war)\n- (khrushchev, puts_pressure_on, soviet american relations)\n- (anti imperialist propaganda, starts_wave_of, late 1950s)\n- (un conference 1960, announces_by, khrushchev)\n- (soviet union, declares_itself_as, anti imperialist)\n- (ussr, is_hybrid_entity_containing, multinational empires and nation states)\n- (old russian traditions of expansion and control, are_continued_by, ussr)\n- (mao zedong, critiques_soviet_union, imperialist power)\n- (soviet union, maintains_facade_of, socialist state)\n- (non russian marxists, view_soviet_regime_as, renewed version of imperialism and colonialism)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The three major American broadcast networks are all headquartered in New York: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Many cable networks are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO, Showtime, Bravo, Food Network, AMC, and Comedy Central. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYCTV, that has produced several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods and city government. The Cube is an hour-long teleplay that aired on NBC's weekly anthology television show \"NBC Experiment in Television\" in 1969. The production was produced and directed by puppeteer and filmmaker Jim Henson, and was one of several experiments with the live-action film medium which he conducted in the 1960s, before focusing entirely on \"The Muppets\" and other puppet works. The screenplay was co-written by long-time Muppet writer Jerry Juhl. Celebrity Big Brother also known as Big Brother: Celebrity Edition is a spin - off series of the American reality television series Big Brother. This season will air during the winter of the 2017 -- 18 network television season on CBS and will be the second U.S. Big Brother season to air outside the usual summer television season, the first being Big Brother 9 in 2008. Julie Chen will return as host, with Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan returning as executive producers.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, believes, theotokos)\n- (theotokos, supports, marian decrees)\n- (marian decrees, includes, dogmas of the church)\n- (martin luther, supports, immaculate conception early in life)\n- (immaculate conception, precedes, pope pius ix's declaration)\n- (pope pius ix's declaration, marks, historical event)\n- (martin luther, changes position on, assumption of mary later in life)\n- (assumption of mary, is mentioned in, bible)\n- (bible, does not include, assumption of mary)\n- (luther, criticizes, liturgical practices related to assumption of mary)\n- (martin luther, reveres, mary (virgin mary))\n- (mary (virgin mary), connects, christocentric theology)\n- (christocentric theology, guides, preaching and teaching activities)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.

She was born either a deaf-mute or just deaf and mentally challenged and was very sickly. She possibly had a degenerative disease, did not survive her fourth year and died at Windsor. Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the abbey. In 1216, Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne, because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral. This coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the abbey on 17 May 1220.

Three Nobel laureates, several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centres. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006, making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as Ciudad Universitaria, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. Born in Mexico city, he studied civil engineering at UNAM. He became president of the student society of the Faculty of Sciences in 1936 and University Counsellor in 1938. He taught for more than 20 years in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (a high school of UNAM) and the National School of Engineering (later Faculty of Engineering), of whom he was director from 1955 to 1958. He became Rector on May 5, 1966. During his rectorship, the government and the army entered Ciudad Universitaria, UNAM's main campus. In protest of these actions and the indiscriminate beating of UNAM's students, he resigned his post on September 23, 9 days before the massacre in Tlatelolco.

The commission is notable for being the first modern truth commission to be bilateral.

The station's main format is classic country targeted towards Springfield, and their transmitter - and former studios - are also located in Springfield. Jackson Township is one of eleven townships in Randolph County, Indiana, United States. As of the 2010 census, its population was 619 and it contained 250 housing units. Owing to its role in the state's history, the county motto is \"Where Illinois Began.\" It contains the historically important village of Kaskaskia, Illinois's first capital. Springfield's original name was Calhoun, after Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (wize am 1340, has_owner, iheartmedia, inc.)\n- (iheartmedia, inc., owns cluster, dayton cluster)\n- (dayton cluster, includes_station, wize am 1340)\n- (wize am 1340, is_format_of, classic country format)\n- (classic country format, targets_audience_in, springfield, ohio)\n- (springfield, ohio, has radio station, wize am 1340)\n- (jackson township, is_part_of, randolph county, indiana)\n- (randolph county, indiana, has township, jackson township)\n- (jackson township, has_population, 619)\n- (2010 census, records_population_in, jackson township)\n- (jackson township, has_housing_units, 250)\n- (randolph county, indiana, has village, kaskaskia village)\n- (kaskaskia village, is_first_capital_of, illinois)\n- (randolph county, indiana, motto is, \"where illinois began\")\n- (springfield, ohio, original name was, calhoun)\n- (calhoun, named_after, senator john c. calhoun of south carolina)\n- (sangamon river, was_settled_by_trappers_and_traders_in, 1818)\n- (john kelly, built_first_cabin_at, second street and jefferson street intersection in springfield, ohio)\n- (springfield, ohio, became county seat of, sangamon county due to fertile soil and trading opportunities in 1821)\n- (senator calhoun, fell_out_of_favor_with_public_by, 1832)\n- (springfield, ohio, renamed itself after, springfield, massachusetts in 1832)\n- (springfield, massachusetts, was known for industrial innovation at that time)\n- (springfield armory, located_in, springfield, massachusetts)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

But Litorius, with the aid of the Huns, prevented the capture of the city and drove the Visigoths back to their capital Tolosa. Theodoric's offer of peace was refused, but the king won the decisive battle at Tolosa, and Litorius soon died in Gothic imprisonment from the injuries which he had received in this battle. Avitus went \u2013 according to the orders of Ae\u0308tius \u2013 to Tolosa and offered a peace treaty which Theodoric accepted. Perhaps the Romans recognized at that time the sovereignty of the Visigoth state. Aksum is mentioned in the 1st - century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as an important market place for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world. It states that the ruler of Aksum in the 1st century AD was Zoskales, who, besides ruling the kingdom, likewise controlled land near the Red Sea: Adulis (near Massawa) and lands through the highlands of present - day Eritrea.

Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households. The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top. As a result, the mean tends to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. Aaron Spelling (April 22, 1923 \u2013 June 23, 2006) was an American film and television producer. Some of his works include the TV programs Charlie's Angels (1976\u201381), The Love Boat (1977\u201386), Hart to Hart (1979\u201384), Dynasty (1981\u201389), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990\u20132000), 7th Heaven (1996\u20132007), and Charmed (1998\u20132006).

It was destroyed in 1828 by the Thais, who burned and pillaged Vientiane following the defeat of the last king of the Vientiane dynasty of Lan Xang, Chao Anouvong. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs.

The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. Swiss are fans of football and the national team is nicknamed the 'Nati'. The headquarters of the sport's governing body, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), is located in Zu\u0308rich.

Records. After both the album and its singles failed to chart in the United States (although \"I Will (Take You Forever)\" did chart in several other countries) and due in large part to the general decline in sales beginning with \"Another Page\" (1983), Cross was soon released from Warner Bros. \"Swept Away\" was previously heard on a few episodes of the TV show \"Growing Pains\" in 1987. It would be nearly five years until Cross signed a new recording contract with BMG and release a new album, \"Rendezvous\", in 1993. \"Think of Laura\" is a popular song by the American Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Christopher Cross. Released as a single in late 1983 from Cross' second studio album, \"Another Page\", \"Think of Laura\" became the singer's fourth (and, to date, final) single to reach the Top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at #9 in early 1984. The song spent eleven weeks in the Top 40. In addition, the song became Cross' third single to hit #1 on the adult contemporary chart, following \"Never Be the Same\" and \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\". \"Think of Laura\" remained at #1 on this chart for four weeks.

From 1928 until 1965, this was also home to the state's male death row. The first executions on the electric chair were on February 8, 1924, when Charles Reynolds, Ewell Morris, George Washington, Mack Matthews, and Melvin Johnson had their death sentences carried out. The five executions were the most carried out on a single day in the state. The state would conduct multiple executions on a single day on several other occasions, the last being on August 9, 2000. Since then, the state has not executed more than one person on a single day, though there is no law prohibiting it. A total of 361 people were electrocuted in Texas, with the last being Joseph Johnson on July 30, 1964.

Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973\u20131048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981\u20131037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt. One of the common definitions for \"Islamic philosophy\" is \"the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.\" Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. The Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980\u20131037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook The Canon of Medicine was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries. He also wrote The Book of Healing, an influential scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (fielding h. garrison, has_program, persian geology after conquests)\n- (persian geology after conquests, includes, early scientific thought influence)\n- (muslim conquests, ended, persian culture influence on science)\n- (abu al-rayhan al-biruni, is, persian geologist)\n- (abu al-rayhan al-biruni, has_works, geology of india writings)\n- (geology of india writings, includes, early geological studies in india)\n- (abu al-rayhan al-biruni, hypothesized, indian subcontinent was once a sea)\n- (indian subcontinent was once a sea, explains, continental formation hypothesis)\n- (ibn sina, proposed, mountain and earthquake theories)\n- (mountain and earthquake theories, includes, scientific explanations for geological phenomena)\n- (ibn sina, drew_from, greek and indian scientific literature)\n- (greek and indian scientific literature, survived, muslim conquests preservation)\n- (shen kuo, formulated, land formation hypothesis based on fossils)\n- (land formation hypothesis based on fossils, includes, early geological studies in china)\n- (shen kuo, inferred, mountains erode into silt forming land through deposition)\n- (mountains erode into silt forming land through deposition, explains, detailed understanding of geological processes)\n- (islamic philosophy, is_defined_as, style of philosophy in islamic culture)\n- (style of philosophy in islamic culture, includes, philosophical thought within islamic framework)\n- (islamic philosophy, does_not_concern, religious issues exclusively for muslims)\n- (religious issues exclusively for muslims, excludes, broad inclusivity and secular nature of ideas)\n- (ibn sina, had_books_attributed_to_him, more than 450 books)\n- (more than 450 books, includes, extensive scholarly output by persian philosopher)\n- (ibn sina, wrote_about, philosophy and medicine)\n- (philosophy and medicine, covers, diverse academic interests of prominent scholar)\n- (the canon of medicine book, was_used_as_standard_text_in, european universities for centuries)\n- (european universities for centuries, includes, influence of islamic medical knowledge on western education systems)\n- (ibn sina, wrote, the book of healing encyclopedia)\n- (the book of healing encyclopedia, covers, comprehensive scholarly work covering multiple disciplines by persian philosopher)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Two years later, he ascended to the throne of England as King James I of England. Macbeth (/ m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8 /; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (king james vi, attended_assembly, general assembly of the church of scotland)\n- (general assembly of the church of scotland, held_in, st columba's church)\n- (st columba's church, located_in, burntisland, fife)\n- (burntisland, fife, event date, may 1601)\n- (general assembly of the church of scotland, discussed, new translation of the bible (english))\n- (king james vi, ascended_to_throne, throne of england)\n- (throne of england, resulted_in, king james i)\n- (macbeth, written_by, william shakespeare)\n- (the tragedy of macbeth, full_title_of, macbeth)\n- (macbeth, first_performed_in, 1606)\n- (macbeth, dramatises_effects_of, political ambition)\n- (plays (during james i's reign), includes_play, macbeth)\n- (macbeth, reflects_relationship_with, relationship (shakespeare and king james i))\n- (james i, patron_of, shakespeare's acting company)\n- (macbeth, first_published_in, folio of 1623)\n- (macbeth, possibly_published_from, prompt book)\n- (shortest tragedy (macbeth), written_by, william shakespeare)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Owned by Midlands Media Group LLC, the station broadcasts a country music format branded as 94.3 The Dude. John Doby Kennedy (January 5, 1840 \u2013 April 14, 1896) was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, as well as a post-war planter, attorney, politician, and the 57th Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina serving under Governor Johnson Hagood. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers. Forest Acres is a city in Richland County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census.

The selection process was controversial; the battle between the contractors was bitter, the Ministry of Defence favoured ALARM to retain UK industrial capabilities while the Treasury favoured the cheaper and proven HARM.

A leading figure in the women's movement in the United States, her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often credited with sparking the second wave of American feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women \"into the mainstream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men.\" Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income. Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households. The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top. As a result, the mean tends to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. The Feminine Mystique is a book written by Betty Friedan which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second - wave feminism in the United States. It was published on February 19, 1963 by W.W. Norton.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the feminine mystique, sparked_wave_of_feminism, second wave of american feminism)\n- (betty friedan, co-founded_organization_in_year, national organization for women in 1966)\n- (national organization for women, elected_first_president, betty friedan)\n- (mean household income, is_measurement_type, mean household income)\n- (median household income, is_measurement_type, median household income)\n- (mean income distribution, reflects_unequal_distribution_more_than, median income distribution)\n- (us census bureau, publishes_report_in_year, annual social and economic supplement in 2014)\n- (annual social and economic supplement, reports_mean_household_income_value, $72,641)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The documentary film had its world premiere on 19 October 2013 at Sava Centar in Belgrade and was aired on Radio Television Serbia on 20 October 2014. Tito was interred in a mausoleum in Belgrade, which forms part of a memorial complex in the grounds of the Museum of Yugoslav History (formerly called \"Museum 25 May\" and \"Museum of the Revolution\"). The actual mausoleum is called House of Flowers (Kuc\u0301a Cvec\u0301a) and numerous people visit the place as a shrine to \"better times\". The museum keeps the gifts Tito received during his presidency. The collection also includes original prints of Los Caprichos by Francisco Goya, and many others. The Government of Serbia has planned to merge it into the Museum of the History of Serbia. At the time of his death, speculation began about whether his successors could continue to hold Yugoslavia together. Ethnic divisions and conflict grew and eventually erupted in a series of Yugoslav wars a decade after his death.

Jean De\u0301sire\u0301 Gustave Courbet (; 10 June 1819 \u2013 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting. Committed to painting only what he could see, he rejected academic convention and the Romanticism of the previous generation of visual artists. His independence set an example that was important to later artists, such as the Impressionists and the Cubists.

On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders.

Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.

Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (333 bc, has_event, state of chu built jinling yi)\n- (state of chu built jinling yi, involves_city, jinling yi)\n- (jinling yi, located_in, western part of present-day nanjing)\n- (state of chu built jinling yi, precedes_elimination_of, state of yue)\n- (qin shi huang reign, has_event, renaming jinling yi to moling)\n- (renaming jinling yi to moling, involves_city, jinling yi)\n- (renaming jinling yi to moling, results_in, moling)\n- (area, experiences_cycle_of, destruction and renewal)\n- (area, was_part_of, kuaiji prefecture)\n- (kuaiji prefecture, succeeded_by, zhang prefecture)\n- (zhang prefecture, succeeded_by, danyang prefecture)\n- (5th year of yuanfeng, has_event, establishment of yangzhou region)\n- (establishment of yangzhou region, establishes, yangzhou region)\n- (nanjing, served_as_capital_for, danyang prefecture)\n- (late han to early tang period, nanjing_served_as_capital_for, yangzhou region)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Two years later, he ascended to the throne of England as King James I of England. Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (king james vi of scotland, attended, general assembly of the church of scotland)\n- (general assembly of the church of scotland, discussed_proposals_for, new bible translation into english)\n- (king james vi of scotland, ascended_to_throne_as, king james i of england)\n- (king james i of england, sold_off_part_of, crown freehold)\n- (crown freehold, retained_site_for, establishing mulberry garden)\n- (eye cross, fell_into_decay_by_time, crown freehold was subject to speculation)\n- (various owners, leased_parts_of, crown freehold from royal landlords in the 17th century)\n- (the old village of eye cross, became_mostly_wasteland_during, 17th century)\n- (james i, established_mulberry_garden_at, northwest corner of palace site)\n- (clement walker, referred_to_in_anarchia_anglicana, new-erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s james's)\n- (sir hugh audley, inherited_part_of, crown freehold during 17th century)\n- (mary davies, eventually_inherited_freehold_from, sir hugh audley)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In the opener of Season 4, the two characters are revealed to be dating, and as such, other character romances, such as the romance between fellow co-workers Dwight Schrute and Angela Martin, begin to move more toward the forefront of episodes. In Season 6, Jim and Pam are married in the season's 4th and 5th episodes (hour long), a feat considered noteworthy by many television critics, as bringing together the two lead love interests in a television series is often thought to be a risky venture. Their child is born in the second half of the season, during another hour long,`` The Delivery''. Pam and Jim's second child is born during season 8. In season 9, their marriage becomes strained when Jim takes up a second job in Philadelphia. They ultimately decide to leave Dunder Mifflin together so Jim can pursue his dream job. Jim and Pam marry early in the season, at Niagara Falls, during the highly anticipated, hour long episode, ``Niagara ''. The ending of the episode, in which their co-workers dance down the aisle, is an imitation of a viral YouTube video -- JK Wedding Entrance Dance.

However, arrangements in the UK were also called 'anti-aircraft', abbreviated as AA, a term that remained in general use into the 1950s. After the First World War it was sometimes prefixed by 'Light' or 'Heavy' (LAA or HAA) to classify a type of gun or unit. Nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include AA, AAA or triple-A, an abbreviation of anti-aircraft artillery; \"ack-ack\" (from the spelling alphabet used by the British for voice transmission of \"AA\"); and archie (a World War I British term probably coined by Amyas Borton and believed to derive via the Royal Flying Corps from the music-hall comedian George Robey's line \"Archibald, certainly not!\").

The Ottoman Empire stood between the West and the East, thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing Spanish and Portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the Orient. The Empire controlled the spice route that Marco Polo once used. When Vasco da Gama bypassed Ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with India in 1498, and Christopher Columbus first journeyed to the Bahamas in 1492, the Ottoman Empire was at its zenith. In the Footsteps of Marco Polo is a 2008 PBS documentary film detailing Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell's 1993 retracing of Marco Polo's journey from Venice to Anatolia, Persia, India and China. The movie documents the first quest \"to visit and document every region Marco Polo claimed to have traveled\" using only land and sea methods of transportation. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" writes that the documentary includes how Belliveau and O'Donnell \"encountered Mongol horsemen and hostile Chinese security officers and survived a firefight between Afghan factions. In the spirit of Polo's journey -- and to prove a point regarding the authenticity of his account -- they disdained airplanes, traveling by foot, on horses and camels and by jeep, boat and train.\" A text by the same name as the video, \"In the Footsteps of Marco Polo\", written by Belliveau and O'Donnell, and published by Rowman & Littlefield, serves as a companion to the documentary film. \"In the Footsteps of Marco Polo\" has been used by Belliveau to create a unique interdisciplinary educational curriculum that he presents at schools and libraries across the United States and internationally. In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ottoman empire, has_location_between, west (geopolitical region))\n- (ottoman empire, has_location_between, east (geopolitical region))\n- (ottoman empire, controls_routes_to, orient)\n- (spanish navigators, seeks_alternative_route, sea routes)\n- (portuguese navigators, seeks_alternative_route, sea routes)\n- (ottoman empire, controlled_routes_to, india)\n- (vasco da gama, established_trade_links_with, india)\n- (vasco da gama, has_year_of_event, 1498)\n- (christopher columbus, traveled_to, bahamas)\n- (christopher columbus, has_year_of_event, 1492)\n- (in the footsteps of marco polo (documentary film), produced_in_year, 2008)\n- (denis belliveau, retraced_journey_with, francis o'donnell)\n- (francis o'donnell, retraced_journey_with, denis belliveau)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, journeyed_from_to, venice to anatolia persia india china)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, has_year_of_event, 1993)\n- (in the footsteps of marco polo (documentary film), includes_encounter_with, mongol horsemen)\n- (in the footsteps of marco polo (documentary film), includes_encounter_with, chinese security officers)\n- (denis belliveau, encountered_firefight_with, afghan factions)\n- (francis o'donnell, encountered_firefight_with, afghan factions)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, traveled_by_foot, foot travel)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, traveled_by_horse_and_camel, horse travel camel travel)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, traveled_by_jeep, jeep travel)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, traveled_by_boat, boat travel)\n- (belliveau and o'donnell, traveled_by_train, train travel)\n- (text (in the footsteps of marco polo), written_by, denis belliveau)\n- (text (in the footsteps of marco polo), written_by, francis o'donnell)\n- (text (in the footsteps of marco polo), published_by, rowman & littlefield)\n- (text (in the footsteps of marco polo), has_year_of_publication, 2008)\n- (in the footsteps of marco polo (text), serves_as_companion_to, in the footsteps of marco polo (documentary film))\n- (denis belliveau, uses_documentary_and_book_for, interdisciplinary educational curriculum)\n- (francis o'donnell, uses_documentary_and_book_for, interdisciplinary educational curriculum)\n- (interdisciplinary educational curriculum, presented_at, schools and libraries across the united states and internationally)\n- (in the footsteps of marco polo (documentary film), has_companion_text, in the footsteps of marco polo (text))\n- (the plague, caused_deaths_in, paris)\n- (the plague, has_year_of_event, 1466)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

He was a great-grandson of Johannes Roosevelt, the founder of the Oyster Bay branch of the Roosevelt family. His brother Cornelius Roosevelt was the father of James A. Roosevelt, Robert Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. as well as paternal grandfather of President Theodore Roosevelt. As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft and toured the USA and Europe. The band also played on Broadway for the play \"Porgy\" by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the real Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage. Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel into the now famous opera, Porgy and Bess (so named so as to distinguish it from the play). George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at Folly Beach outside of Charleston writing this \"folk opera\", as Gershwin called it.

This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits.

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own.

Papa Roach is an American rock band from Vacaville, California, formed in 1993. The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther. The city had a population of 1,307,402 according to the 2010 census, distributed over a land area of 372.1 square miles (963.7 km2). The urban area of San Diego extends beyond the administrative city limits and had a total population of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest urban area in the state, after that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and San Francisco metropolitan area. They, along with the Riverside\u2013San Bernardino, form those metropolitan areas in California larger than the San Diego metropolitan area, with a total population of 3,095,313 at the 2010 census. \"Getting Away with Murder\" is the first single from the band Papa Roach's third album, \"Getting Away with Murder\". The song shows the band's new sound, the sound of the song is hard rock instead of their previous nu metal sound. The song also features no rapping at all, something that was used in Papa Roach's previous singles. The video is performance-based, showing the band playing in a Stock Exchange Hall with references filled with fans (including sexual imagery which led the band's lead singer Jacoby Shaddix to describe the video as \"stocks and bondage\" in an MTV2 interview). It was directed by Motion Theory.

Pope John XXIII (25 November 1881 \u2013 3 June 1963) and Pope John Paul II (18 May 1920 \u2013 2 April 2005) reigned as popes of the Roman Catholic Church and the sovereigns of Vatican City (respectively from 1958 to 1963 and 1978 to 2005). Their canonizations were held on 27 April 2014. The decision to canonize was made official by Pope Francis on 5 July 2013 following the recognition of a miracle attributed to the intercession of John Paul II, while John XXIII was canonized for his merits of opening the Second Vatican Council. The date of the canonization was assigned on 30 September 2013. The post of Governor of Vatican City (Governatore dello Stato della Citta\u0300 del Vaticano in Italian) was held by Marchese Camillo Serafini from the foundation of the state in 1929 until his death in 1952.

He was the flag bearer of Myanmar sports team at the opening ceremony. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (zaw win thet, has_birth_date, 1 march 1991)\n- (1 march 1991, is_on, zaw win thet birth date)\n- (zaw win thet, has_hometown, kyonpyaw pathein district ayeyarwady division myanmar)\n- (kyonpyaw pathein district ayeyarwady division myanmar, is_in, zaw win thet hometown)\n- (zaw win thet, participated_in_event, 400 m event at 2012 summer olympics)\n- (400 m event at 2012 summer olympics, is_part_of, olympic games)\n- (zaw win thet, was_flag_bearer_for, myanmar sports team at opening ceremony of 2012 summer olympics)\n- (myanmar sports team at opening ceremony of 2012 summer olympics, has_member, zaw win thet)\n- (western european states, avoided, ottoman trade monopoly through new maritime routes)\n- (ottoman trade monopoly, was_avoided_by, western european states via new maritime routes)\n- (the portuguese, discovered, cape of good hope in 1488)\n- (cape of good hope, was_discovered_in_1488_by, the portuguese)\n- (a series of ottoman-portuguese naval wars, occurred_in, indian ocean throughout the 6th century)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, allied_with, ottomans against portuguese economic monopoly)\n- (ottoman trade monopoly, was_defied_by, somali muslim ajuran empire through new coinage pattern)\n- (the ajuran empire, employed_new_coinage_following_pattern_of, ottoman design in defiance of portuguese economic monopoly)\n- (in 1613, the ajuran empire regrouped and defeated, siam)\n- (the ajuran empire, restored_smaller_kingdom_including, lower myanmar upper myanmar shan states lan na upper tenasserim)\n- (legal and political framework, continued_until, 19th century under restored toungoo kings)\n- (hereditary chieftainships, were_replaced_by, appointed governorships in irrawaddy valley by the crown)\n- (kingdom stability, was_impacted_by, meithei raids and rebellion in lan na from 1720s onwards)\n- (restored hanthawaddy kingdom, was_founded_by, the mon of lower myanmar in 1740)\n- (ava, was_sacked_and_made_end_of_toungoo_dynasty_by, hanthawaddy forces in 1752)\n- (new maritime trade routes, allowed_western_european_states_to_avoid, ottoman trade monopoly after portuguese discovery)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

For the next three seasons he played occasionally for the first team either at full back or as Trevor Smith's deputy at centre-half, most notably in the first leg of the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final against A.S. Roma. When Smith sustained the injury that resulted in him leaving the club, Foster took over at centre half and kept his place for another couple of seasons. He was used less frequently in his last two years at the club, and spent three months on loan at Crewe Alexandra before making a permanent move to Plymouth Argyle where he ended his Football League career. He went on to play for Chelmsford City and Bromsgrove Rovers, and spent one season as Bromsgrove's assistant manager. The Trophy was stolen from a display in the shop window of W. Shillcock (a football fitter) in Newton Row, Birmingham, after the Final and never recovered despite a \u00a310 reward. According to the Police, it was taken sometime between 21:30 on Wednesday 11 September and 7:30 the following morning, along with cash from a drawer. The cup was replaced by a copy of the original, made by Howard Vaughton, the former Aston Villa player and England international, who had opened a silversmith's business after his retirement from the game.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (foster, has_birthplace, south yardley)\n- (south yardley, is_part_of, birmingham)\n- (foster, joined_organization, birmingham city junior program)\n- (birmingham city junior program, has_duration, three seasons)\n- (birmingham city junior program, includes_role, full back)\n- (birmingham city junior program, includes_role, trevor smith's deputy at centre-half)\n- (foster, made_debut_at_age, 19 years old)\n- (19 years old debut, occurred_in_context, birmingham city first team)\n- (birmingham city first team, has_position, full back)\n- (foster, played_in_match, 1961 inter-cities fairs cup final against a.s. roma)\n- (1961 inter-cities fairs cup final against a.s. roma, is_part_of, birmingham city career)\n- (trevor smith, left_organization, birmingham city due to injury)\n- (birmingham city, appointed_player, foster as centre half after trevor smith's departure)\n- (foster, kept_position_for_seasons, two seasons)\n- (less frequent use, occurred_in_context, birmingham city career)\n- (foster, spent_time_on_loan_at, crewe alexandra for three months)\n- (crewe alexandra loan period, is_part_of, birmingham city career)\n- (foster, made_permanent_move_to, plymouth argyle)\n- (plymouth argyle, ended_foster's, football league career)\n- (after leaving plymouth argyle, foster played_for, chelmsford city and bromsgrove rovers)\n- (chelmsford city and bromsgrove rovers, are_part_of, foster's later career)\n- (foster, spent_season_as, bromsgrove's assistant manager)\n- (bromsgrove's assistant manager role, is_part_of, foster's post-playing career)\n- (the trophy was stolen from, w. shillcock in newton row, birmingham)\n- (newton row, birmingham, has location details, between 21:30 on wednesday 11 september and 7:30 the following morning)\n- (w. shillcock's reward offer, is_part_of, trophy theft incident context)\n- (howard vaughton's copy, is_part_of, aftermath of trophy theft)\n- (aston villa, has_connection_to, howard vaughton's career)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

At 7,821 metres (25,659 ft) it is the 22nd highest mountain in the world and the 9th highest in Pakistan. It was the first mapped peak in the Karakoram mountain range, hence the designation \"K1\". Abul Kalam Azad expressed concern over the likelihood of violent riots, to which Mountbatten replied:At least on this question I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot. I am a soldier and not a civilian. Once the partition is accepted in principle, I shall issue orders to see that there are no communal disturbances anywhere in the country. If there should be the slightest agitation, I shall adopt the sternest measures to nip the trouble in the bud. Jagmohan has stated that this and what followed shows the \"glaring\" \"failure of the government machinery\".On 3 June 1947, the partition plan was accepted by the Congress Working Committee. Boloji states that in Punjab there were no riots but there was communal tension, while Gandhi was reportedly isolated by Nehru and Patel and observed maun vrat (day of silence). Mountbatten visited Gandhi and said he hoped that he would not oppose the partition, to which Gandhi wrote the reply: \"Have I ever opposed you?\"Within British India, the border between India and Pakistan (the Radcliffe Line) was determined by a British Government-commissioned report prepared under the chairmanship of a London barrister, Sir Cyril Radcliffe.

The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama.

Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established late due to mutual hostility. During World War II, the two countries were briefly allies. At the end of the war, the first signs of post-war mistrust and hostility began to appear between the two countries, escalating into the Cold War; a period of tense hostile relations, with periods of de\u0301tente. Passive air defence is defined by NATO as \"Passive measures taken for the physical defence and protection of personnel, essential installations and equipment in order to minimize the effectiveness of air and/or missile attack\". It remains a vital activity by ground forces and includes camouflage and concealment to avoid detection by reconnaissance and attacking aircraft. Measures such as camouflaging important buildings were common in the Second World War. During the Cold War the runways and taxiways of some airfields were painted green.

Winchester is part of the Jacksonville Micropolitan Statistical Area. Virginia has a total area of , including of water, making it the 35th-largest state by area. Virginia is bordered by Maryland and Washington, D.C. to the north and east; by the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by North Carolina to the south; by Tennessee to the southwest; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the north and west. Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River. The southern border is defined as the 36\u00b0 30\u2032 parallel north, though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes. The border with Tennessee was not settled until 1893, when their dispute was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Ce\u0301vennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Loze\u0300re. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

(also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. Pinball Quest is the name of a Nintendo Entertainment System video game developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco in 1990. The game is based on the popular arcade game pinball.

Jewish communities were expelled from England in 1290 and from France in 1306. Although some were allowed back into France, most were not, and many Jews emigrated eastwards, settling in Poland and Hungary. The Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, and dispersed to Turkey, France, Italy, and Holland. The rise of banking in Italy during the 13th century continued throughout the 14th century, fuelled partly by the increasing warfare of the period and the needs of the papacy to move money between kingdoms.

He became Austrian minister in Turin at the court of King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, in St. Petersburg at the court of Catherine the Great, and then Paris at the court of King Louis XV of France in 1766. In Paris, his first work was to strengthen the alliance between France and Austria, which was cemented in 1770 by the marriage of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XVI, with Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria, youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, afterwards known as Queen Marie Antoinette. When Louis and Marie Antoinette ascended the throne of France in 1774, Mercy-Argenteau became one of the most powerful personages at the French court due to his influence over Marie-Antoinette, which made her unpopular with the French nobility and French people. He was in Paris during the turbulent years that led up to the French Revolution, and gave powerful aid to the finance ministers Lome\u0301nie de Brienne and Necker. In 1792, he became governor-general of the Austrian Netherlands, which had just been reduced to obedience by Austria. There, his ability and experience made him a very successful ruler. Although at first in favor of moderate courses, Mercy-Argenteau supported the action of Austria in making war upon its former ally after the outbreak of the French Revolution, and in July 1794, he was appointed Austrian ambassador to Britain, but he died a few days after his arrival in London.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (mercy-argenteau, has_birthplace, liege)\n- (liege, is_place_in, belgium)\n- (mercy-argenteau, has_father, antoine comte de mercy argenteau)\n- (mercy-argenteau, enters_service_of, austria diplomatic service)\n- (austria diplomatic service, in_city, paris)\n- (mercy-argenteau, has_patron, reichsfuurst kaunitz)\n- (mercy-argenteau, becomes_minister_in, turin court)\n- (turin court, of_king, charles emmanuel iii of sardinia)\n- (mercy-argenteau, serves_as_minister_in, st petersburg court)\n- (st petersburg court, of_queen, catherine the great)\n- (mercy-argenteau, becomes_minister_in_year, paris court 1766)\n- (paris court 1766, of_king, louis xv of france)\n- (mercy-argenteau, strengthens_alliance_between, france and austria)\n- (mercy-argenteau, witnesses_marriage_of, dauphin with maria antonia)\n- (dauphin with maria antonia, in_year, 1770)\n- (maria antonia, later_known_as, marie antoinette)\n- (marie antoinette, becomes_queen_in, france 1774)\n- (mercy-argenteau, becomes_powerful_at_court_due_to, influence over marie antoinette)\n- (marie antoinette, has_unpopularity_partly_due_to, mercy argenteaus influence)\n- (mercy-argenteau, gives_aid_to_finance_ministers_during_turbulent_years, lomeenie de brienne and necker)\n- (turbulent years, leading_up_to, french revolution)\n- (mercy-argenteau, becomes_governor_general_of_in_year, austrian netherlands 1792)\n- (austrian netherlands 1792, reduced_to_obedience_by, austria)\n- (mercy-argenteau, is_successful_ruler_due_to, ability and experience)\n- (mercy-argenteau, supports_austria_decision_to_make_war_on, former allies after french revolution outbreak)\n- (mercy-argenteau, appointed_as_ambassador_to_in_year, britain july 1794)\n- (britain july 1794, in_city, london)\n- (mercy-argenteau, dies_shortly_after_arriving_in, london)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Laurean Rugambwa (July 12, 1912 \u2013 December 8, 1997) was the first modern native African Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics.

Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism. On 18 June 1948, the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2 calling for covert action against the USSR, and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against \"hostile foreign states or groups\" that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government. To this end, the Office of Policy Coordination was created inside the new CIA. The OPC was quite unique; Frank Wisner, the head of the OPC, answered not to the CIA Director, but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC, and the OPC's actions were a secret even from the head of the CIA.

As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. In France, the immigration of Jews from Algeria (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim. Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population. A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated \"Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry\", as both groups \u2013 the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews \u2013 shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ashkenazi jews, represents, 70% of world jewish population)\n- (ashkenazi jews, represented, up to 90% of global jewish population before wwii/holocaust)\n- (emigration from europe, resulted in, ashkenazim being majority in new world continents)\n- (sephardic jewish immigrants from algeria, outnumber, ashkenazi jews in france)\n- (israeli jewish population, represents, all groups without regard to proportion within world population)\n- (study by atzmon-ostrer et al., 2010, identified, two major groups: middle eastern jews and european/syrian jews)\n- (european jews, shared, common ancestors with middle eastern jews about 2500 years ago)\n- (european jewry, lacks, large-scale genetic contributions from central/eastern european populations and slavic populations according to the study)\n- (ashkenazi jews, share, dna indicating close relationships with non-ashkenazi groups)\n- (iranian jews, possess, unique genetic signatures but are closely related to other jewish groups)\n- (iraqi jews, possess, unique genetic signatures but are closely related to other jewish groups)\n- (syrian jews, possess, unique genetic signatures but are closely related to other jewish groups)\n- (italian jews, possess, unique genetic signatures but are closely related to other jewish groups)\n- (turkish jews, possess, unique genetic signatures but are closely related to other jewish groups)\n- (greek jews, possess, unique genetic signatures but are closely related to other jewish groups)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. A Don is a village in south-eastern Laos near the border with Vietnam. It is located in Kaleum District in Sekong Province. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years.

Philosophy, Fiqh and theology (kalaam) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. Al-Razi and Al-Farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamadan. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. Aruzi Samarqandi describes how before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met Al-Biruni (a famous scientist and astronomer), Abu Nasr Iraqi (a renowned mathematician), Abu Sahl Masihi (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician). Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries.

The brand was originally produced and owned by the R. Monarch Distillery (RD #24, 2nd Dist.) of Owensboro, Kentucky, which entered bankruptcy in 1898 and was purchased by James Thompson in 1901 who renamed the company Glenmore Distillery Company with locations in Owensboro and Louisville, Kentucky. In 1903 The Kentucky Tavern trademark was first registered. Glenmore proved a successful and durable company, its main brand being Kentucky Tavern. It is usually produced as an 80 proof liquor, although a 100 proof is also available. Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Since 1972, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968. The Republicans regained the majority of the Senate in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015; the Republicans had not controlled the Senate since January 2007.

He pioneered the science of experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials. His two most notable works in medicine are the Kita\u0304b al-shifa\u0304\u02be (\"Book of Healing\") and The Canon of Medicine, both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the 17th century. Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases, and the introduction of clinical pharmacology. One of the common definitions for \"Islamic philosophy\" is \"the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.\" Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. The Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980\u20131037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook The Canon of Medicine was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries. He also wrote The Book of Healing, an influential scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ibn sina, has_program, islamic philosophy)\n- (islamic philosophy, defines_as, style of philosophy in islamic culture)\n- (ibn sina, lived_from, 980 (birth year))\n- (980 (birth year), to, 1037 (death year))\n- (ibn sina, authored, kita\u0304b al-shifa\u0304\u02be (\"book of healing\"))\n- (kita\u0304b al-shifa\u0304\u02be (\"book of healing\"), served_as, standard medicinal text (in muslim world))\n- (kita\u0304b al-shifa\u0304\u02be (\"book of healing\"), served_as, standard medicinal text (in europe))\n- (ibn sina, authored, the canon of medicine)\n- (the canon of medicine, served_as, standard medicinal text (in muslim world))\n- (the canon of medicine, served_as, standard textbook in european universities)\n- (ibn sina, introduced, experimental medicine)\n- (ibn sina, conducted, clinical trials (first instance))\n- (ibn sina, discovered, contagious nature of infectious diseases)\n- (ibn sina, introduced, clinical pharmacology)\n- (ibn sina, is_considered, most influential philosopher in islamic philosophy)\n- (ibn sina's writings, covered, philosophy (subject))\n- (ibn sina's writings, covered, medicine (subject))\n- (ibn sina, authored, 450 books)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654. The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is a 1558 painting by Titian, now in the church of I Gesuiti in Venice. It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (violante, has_program, titian attribution program)\n- (titian attribution program, has_amount, 1515 date)\n- (titian attribution program, targets, kunsthistorisches museum in vienna)\n- (in 1466 plague event, has_program, paris plague impact program)\n- (paris plague impact program, has_amount, approximately 40,000 people died)\n- (paris plague impact program, targets, paris city)\n- (the black death, has_program, europe-wide spread program)\n- (europe-wide spread program, has_duration, three years)\n- (europe-wide spread program, targets, russia country)\n- (venice plague events, has_program, venice outbreak frequency program)\n- (venice outbreak frequency program, has_amount, 22 times between 1361 and 1528)\n- (venice outbreak frequency program, targets, venice city)\n- (london plague events, has_program, london population reduction program)\n- (london population reduction program, has_duration, specific years (1563, 1593, etc.))\n- (london population reduction program, has_amount, 10 to 30% of population reduced)\n- (london population reduction program, targets, london city)\n- (amsterdam plague events, has_program, amsterdam outbreak impact program)\n- (amsterdam outbreak impact program, has_duration, between 1623\u201325 and other periods)\n- (amsterdam outbreak impact program, has_amount, over 10% of population died)\n- (amsterdam outbreak impact program, targets, amsterdam city)\n- (venice plague events, has_program, venice 1576-77 outbreak program)\n- (venice 1576-77 outbreak program, has_amount, almost a third (50,000 people) of population died)\n- (venice 1576-77 outbreak program, targets, venice city)\n- (italian plague and thirty years' war, has_program, italian plague association program)\n- (italian plague association program, has_duration, late outbreaks including 1629\u20131631)\n- (italian plague association program, targets, thirty years' war event)\n- (great plague of vienna, has_program, vienna outbreak impact program)\n- (vienna outbreak impact program, has_amount, occurred in 1679)\n- (vienna outbreak impact program, targets, vienna city)\n- (norway plague events, has_program, norway population reduction program)\n- (norway population reduction program, has_duration, over 60% of population died in 1348\u201350)\n- (norway population reduction program, targets, norway country)\n- (oslo plague events, has_program, oslo last outbreak impact program)\n- (oslo last outbreak impact program, has_amount, ravaged in 1654)\n- (oslo last outbreak impact program, targets, oslo city)\n- (the martyrdom of saint lawrence, has_program, titian works distribution program)\n- (titian works distribution program, has_duration, 1558 work by titian)\n- (titian works distribution program, targets, church of i gesuiti in venice)\n- (philip ii of spain patronage, has_program, el escorial commissioning program)\n- (el escorial commissioning program, has_amount, second version commissioned for el escorial)\n- (el escorial commissioning program, targets, philip ii of spain)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The gameplay is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The player navigates \"sub spaces\" of a larger \"world map.\" Gameplay takes place between different subspaces. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?)

In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics.

The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004. Presbyterian denominations that trace their heritage to the British Isles usually organise their church services inspired by the principles in the Directory of Public Worship, developed by the Westminster Assembly in the 1640s. This directory documented Reformed worship practices and theology adopted and developed over the preceding century by British Puritans, initially guided by John Calvin and John Knox. It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the scottish parliament building, has_architect, enric miralles)\n- (enric miralles, collaborates_with, rmjm)\n- (rmjm, led_by, tony kettle)\n- (the scottish parliament building, includes_feature, leaf-shaped buildings)\n- (the scottish parliament building, includes_feature, grass-roofed branch)\n- (the scottish parliament building, includes_feature, gabion walls)\n- (the scottish parliament building, includes_motif, raeburn's skating minister)\n- (the scottish parliament building, includes_feature, crow-stepped gables)\n- (the scottish parliament building, includes_feature, upturned boat skylights in the garden lobby)\n- (the directory of public worship, developed_by, westminster assembly)\n- (westminster assembly, guided_by, john calvin)\n- (westminster assembly, guided_by, john knox)\n- (the scottish parliament building, located_in, holyrood area of edinburgh)\n- (queen elizabeth ii, opens_on, 9 october 2004)\n- (scottish parliament building, opened_by, queen elizabeth ii)\n- (the directory of public worship, enacted_by, scottish parliament)\n- (the directory of public worship, foundational_for, presbyterian church legislation)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The song is a slight return to the band early work, starting with a rapping introduction, but as the introduction goes the rapping then goes into fast screaming making it different from the usual rapping of the band's early releases. Most of the song is singing with Jacoby singing in the verses and also choruses. The song follows the band's hard rock sound of their previous album. The song hit American radio stations on August 7, 2006. The song was played in full on Kerrang! Radio in the United Kingdom on August 1, 2006 and has since become available to download via the iTunes Store and Walmart Downloads store as a radio edit version. On September 18 the single became available in UK stores as a 7\" vinyl picture disc with a complimentary Papa Roach sticker. The CD was released on October 11, 2006. The song was used as the official theme song for \"WWE Raw\" on the USA Network from October 9, 2006 to November 9, 2009. The song has risen to #8 on the \"Mainstream Rock Tracks\" and #14 on the \"Modern Rock Tracks\" and played during the theatrical trailer of the 2008 film Never Back Down.

Roger Sherman of Connecticut, believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers, which did not include establishing a national religion. Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions. However, the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment. Forest Acres is a city in Richland County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141\u201387 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers. The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science.

It was shot at Denham Studios. The film's sets were designed by the art director Frederick Pusey. The term air defence was probably first used by Britain when Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) was created as a Royal Air Force command in 1925. However, arrangements in the UK were also called 'anti-aircraft', abbreviated as AA, a term that remained in general use into the 1950s. After the First World War it was sometimes prefixed by 'Light' or 'Heavy' (LAA or HAA) to classify a type of gun or unit. Nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include AA, AAA or triple-A, an abbreviation of anti-aircraft artillery; \"ack-ack\" (from the spelling alphabet used by the British for voice transmission of \"AA\"); and archie (a World War I British term probably coined by Amyas Borton and believed to derive via the Royal Flying Corps from the music-hall comedian George Robey's line \"Archibald, certainly not!\").\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (southern roses film, directed_by, frederic zelnik)\n- (southern roses film, starred_in_by, george robey)\n- (southern roses film, starred_in_by, gina malo)\n- (southern roses film, starred_in_by, chili bouchier)\n- (southern roses film, shot_at, denham studios)\n- (southern roses film, art_directed_by, frederick pusey)\n- (adgb organization, created_as_command_of, royal air force)\n- (adgb organization, established_in_year, 1925)\n- (adgb organization, introduced_term, air defence)\n- (uk arrangements term, called_anti_aircraft, aa)\n- (anti aircraft guns weapon, prefixed_by, light or heavy)\n- (laa abbreviation, stands_for, light anti aircraft)\n- (haa abbreviation, stands_for, heavy anti aircraft)\n- (anti aircraft nicknames term, includes, aa)\n- (anti aircraft nicknames term, includes, aaa)\n- (anti aircraft nicknames term, includes, triple-a)\n- (ack ack nickname, abbreviation_of, anti aircraft artillery)\n- (ack ack nickname, derived_from_spelling_alphabet, aa)\n- (archie nickname, coined_by, amyas borton)\n- (archibald certainly not line, from_performance, george robey)\n- (southern roses film, set_in_year, 1936)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial. The Worship of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Titian completed between 1518\u20131519, housed at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. It describes a Roman rite of worship conducted in honour of the goddess Venus each 1 April. On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to cleanse \"every blemish on their bodies\". In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (titian, paints, the martyrdom of saint lawrence)\n- (the martyrdom of saint lawrence, has_date, 1558)\n- (philip ii of spain, commissions, second version of the martyrdom of saint lawrence for el escorial)\n- (the martyrdom of saint lawrence, located_at, church of i gesuiti, venice)\n- (titian, completes, the worship of venus)\n- (the worship of venus, has_date_range, 1518-1519)\n- (the worship of venus, describes, roman rite of worship in honor of venus each april 1st)\n- (the worship of venus, housed_at, museo del prado, madrid)\n- (plague, present_in, paris during the 16th and 17th centuries)\n- (plague, kills_people_in, paris in 1466)\n- (number of deaths, is, approximately 40,000 people died from plague in paris in 1466)\n- (london, experiences_population_reduction_due_to, plague outbreaks (1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665))\n- (amsterdam, sees_multiple_epidemics_resulting_in, over 10% of its population dying)\n- (venice, experiences_plague_22_times_between, 1361 and 1528)\n- (outbreak from 1576-77, kills_almost_a_third_of_the_population, venice)\n- (the black death, ravages_europe_for_three_years_before_continuing_into, russia)\n- (plague, present_in_russia_25_times_between, 1350 and 1490)\n- (italian plague, associated_with_troop_movements_during, thirty years' war (1629-1631))\n- (great plague of vienna, occurred_in, 1679)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The karst limestone cave was only discovered in April 2004 by a local farmer who upon entering it found a treasure trove of 229 Buddha statues, estimated to be over 450 years old. It is believed that the Buddha statues were hidden to prevent them being looted by invading Haw peoples. The largest Buddha statue is seated at the main entrance. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly.

The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. WWNQ is a radio station licensed to Forest Acres, South Carolina, serving the Columbia, South Carolina market. Owned by Midlands Media Group LLC, the station broadcasts a country music format branded as 94.3 The Dude. Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line and those south of it, primarily centered on the \"peculiar institution\" of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South seceded from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was loyal to the Union. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable.

The main cause was opposition to the Kansas -- Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The Northern Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The first public meeting of the general ``anti-Nebraska ''movement where the name`` Republican'' was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854, in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party. The Kansas -- Nebraska Act divided the nation and pointed it toward civil war. The Act itself virtually nullified the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The turmoil over the act split both the Democratic and Whig parties and gave rise to the Republican Party, which split the United States into two major political camps, the Republican North and the Democratic South.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (northern states, has_event, founding of republican party)\n- (founding of republican party, occurred_in_year, 1854)\n- (founding of republican party, involved_participants, anti-slavery activists)\n- (founding of republican party, involved_participants, modernizers)\n- (founding of republican party, involved_participants, ex whigs)\n- (founding of republican party, involved_participants, ex free soilers)\n- (republican party, opposes_party, democratic party)\n- (republican party, opposes_party, know nothing party)\n- (kansas -- nebraska act, repealed_law, missouri compromise)\n- (kansas -- nebraska act, main_cause_for_founding, founding of republican party)\n- (northern republicans, saw_as_evil, expansion of slavery due to kansas nebraska act)\n- (anti-nebraska movement, held_first_public_meeting_on, march 20, 1854)\n- (first public meeting of anti-nebraska movement, location_is, ripon, wisconsin)\n- (name \"republican\", suggested_at, first public meeting of anti-nebraska movement)\n- (name \"republican\", pays_homage_to, thomas jefferson's republican party)\n- (kansas -- nebraska act, divided_nation_into_two_major_political_camps, united states)\n- (kansas -- nebraska act, pointed_toward, civil war)\n- (kansas -- nebraska act, virtually_nullified_law, missouri compromise of 1820)\n- (turmoil over kansas nebraska act, split_parties, democratic party)\n- (turmoil over kansas nebraska act, split_parties, whig party)\n- (split in political parties, gave_rise_to_party, republican party)\n- (republican party, split_nation_into_two_major_camps, united states)\n- (united states, has_major_political_camp, republican north)\n- (united states, has_major_political_camp, democratic south)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

She had seen the sheet music in the Woods Building in Chicago and the lyrics attracted her. She recorded the song in February, 1952, in Chicago and it was released in March on the local Sharp Records label. After she signed to MGM, it was reissued as her second single on that label on August 5, 1952, after Jo Stafford, Patti Page and Dean Martin had covered it. James' version also was issued on M-G-M Records for national distribution. The best - known early 1952 version of the song was recorded after James' recording by Sue Thompson on Mercury's country label as catalog number 6407. It was soon covered by Patti Page, whose version was issued by Mercury as catalog number 5899, with ``I Went to Your Wedding ''(a bigger Patti Page hit, reaching No 1) on the flip side. It entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, and lasted 12 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 4. Let There Be Love is Joni James debut album, recorded in 1953 and released by MGM Records at the end of the year. It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 331\u20443-rpm album.

His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Nam Khan is a river in Laos. It flows through Luang Prabang. It is a major tributary of the river Mekong, with which it joins at Luang Prabang. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (myanmar, is_to_the_west_of, bay of bengal)\n- (myanmar, is_to_the_south_of, andaman sea)\n- (nam khan, flows_through, luang prabang)\n- (luang prabang, has_river_junction, mekong river)\n- (western european states, discovered_routes_to_avoid, ottoman trade monopoly)\n- (bartolomeu dias, discovered, cape of good hope in 1488)\n- (cape of good hope discovery, initiated_wars_with, ottomans throughout the 16th century)\n- (ajuran empire, allied_with, ottomans)\n- (ajuran empire, employed_coinage_following_pattern_of, ottoman pattern)\n- (ajuran empire, defeated_in_1613, portugal)\n- (ajuran empire, defeated_in_1614, siam)\n- (after ajuran victories, restored_smaller_kingdom_encompassing, lower myanmar)\n- (after ajuran victories, restored_smaller_kingdom_encompassing, upper myanmar)\n- (after ajuran victories, restored_smaller_kingdom_encompassing, shan states)\n- (after ajuran victories, restored_smaller_kingdom_encompassing, lan na)\n- (after ajuran victories, restored_smaller_kingdom_encompassing, upper tenasserim)\n- (restored toungoo kings, created_legal_framework, continued into 19th century)\n- (restored toungoo kings, replaced_chieftainships_with_governorships_in, irrawaddy valley)\n- (restored toungoo kings, reduced_hereditary_rights_of, shan chiefs)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. During a meeting at Atlantic Hotel (Hamburg) in 1953, a group of Iranian residents of Germany discussed the need to establish their own religious center. A letter was sent to the late Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi asking him for help; Grand Ayatollah agreed with the plan and donated 100,000 Rials to the center. The construction began in 1960 and by 1965 it was completed. In the same year Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti was appointed to lead the center. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast.

He undertook two voyages through the Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848. The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie and back. Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria. Casa Loma (Spanish for ``Hill House '') is a Gothic Revival style mansion and garden in midtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that is now a historic house museum and landmark. It was constructed from 1911 to 1914 as a residence for financier Sir Henry Pellatt. The architect was E. J. Lennox, who designed several other city landmarks. Casa Loma sits at an elevation of 140 metres (460 ft) above sea level. Scene in the Northwest: Portrait of John Henry Lefroy, also known as The Surveyor, is a painting by Paul Kane circa 1845. It sold at auction in 2002 for C$5.1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at that time. It was purchased by media magnate Ken Thomson, who donated it to the Art Gallery of Ontario. The painting depicts British explorer John Henry Lefroy on his successful expedition to map the Magnetic North Pole.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (paul kane, has_program, paul kane training program)\n- (paul kane training program, targets, european masters)\n- (paul kane, undertook_voyage, first voyage 1845)\n- (first voyage 1845, targets, toronto to sault ste marie and back)\n- (paul kane, secured_support_for_voyage, second voyage hbc support)\n- (second voyage hbc support, targets, hudsons bay company)\n- (paul kane, undertook_voyage, second voyage 1846 to 1848)\n- (second voyage 1846 to 1848, targets, toronto across rocky mountains to fort vancouver and fort victoria)\n- (casa loma, was_constructed_by, henry pellatt construction program)\n- (henry pellatt construction program, targets, casa loma mansion and garden)\n- (e. j. lennox, designed, casa loma architecture program)\n- (casa loma architecture program, targets, gothic revival style mansion in toronto)\n- (scene in the northwest: portrait of john henry lefroy, was_painted_by, paul kane 1845 program)\n- (paul kane 1845 program, targets, john henry lefroy)\n- (scene in the northwest: portrait of john henry lefroy, sold_for, c$5.1 million auction 2002 program)\n- (c$5.1 million auction 2002 program, has_amount, c$5.1 million)\n- (c$5.1 million auction 2002 program, targets, scene in the northwest portrait of john henry lefroy)\n- (scene in the northwest: portrait of john henry lefroy, purchased_by, ken thomson collection program)\n- (ken thomson collection program, targets, scene in the northwest portrait of john henry lefroy)\n- (scene in the northwest: portrait of john henry lefroy, donated_to, art gallery of ontario donation program)\n- (art gallery of ontario donation program, targets, scene in the northwest portrait of john henry lefroy)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.

During the Korean War, the movement of United Nations troops approaching the river precipitated massive Chinese intervention from around Dandong. In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the Sino -- Korean Friendship Bridge connecting Sinuiju, North Korea to Dandong, China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of dogfights for air superiority over North Korea, earning the nickname ``MiG Alley ''in reference to the MiG - 15 fighters flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese and Soviet forces. For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought, but exchanged little territory; the stalemate held. Large - scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong. On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team. Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the UN Command forces' goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory. The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (japanese rule (1910 -- 1945), has_program, korean industrialization program)\n- (korean industrialization program, includes, significant portion of imperial japan's total industrial output)\n- (korean industrialization program, targets, korea)\n- (movement of united nations troops approaching the river, precipitates, massive chinese intervention from around dandong during the korean war)\n- (every bridge across the river except one, was_destroyed, during the conflict)\n- (the remaining bridge, is_the, sino-korean friendship bridge connecting sinuiju, north korea to dandong, china)\n- (during the war, the valley surrounding the western end of the river, became a focal point for, dogfights for air superiority over north korea)\n- (this area earned the nickname \"mig alley\", due_to, mig-15 fighters flown by combined forces (north korean, chinese, and soviet))\n- (protracted armistice negotiations began on 10 july 1951 at kaesong, involves, zhou enlai directing peace talks for china)\n- (zhou enlai directed peace talks for china, includes, li kenong and qiao guanghua heading the negotiation team for china)\n- (combat continued while belligerents negotiated during the korean war, involves, un command forces aiming to recapture all of south korea and avoid losing territory)\n- (pva and kpa attempted similar operations during negotiations, aims_to, test the resolve of the un command)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians. In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations (1948), Stalin published Falsifiers of History, which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution. Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy - year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (tsfsr, has_existence_period, 1922 to 1936)\n- (1922 to 1936, ends_with_year, 1936)\n- (1936, leads_to_division_of, tsfsr)\n- (tsfsr, divides_into, armenian ssr)\n- (tsfsr, divides_into, azerbaijan ssr)\n- (tsfsr, divides_into, georgian ssr)\n- (armenians, enjoy_stability_under, soviet rule)\n- (soviet rule, provides_contrast_to, ottoman empire turbulent years)\n- (moscow, provides_provisions_for, armenians)\n- (church, struggles_under, soviet rule)\n- (joseph stalin, takes_power_after, vladimir lenin death)\n- (armenians, experience_fear_and_terror_during, stalin era)\n- (nazi soviet relations, publishes_in_year, 1948)\n- (falsifiers of history, responds_to_publication_of, nazi soviet relations documents)\n- (1977 constitution of the ussr, establishes_role_as_head_of_government_for, chairman of the council of ministers)\n- (1977 constitution of the ussr, establishes_role_as_head_of_state_for, chairman of the presidium)\n- (soviet union, lacks_official_leader_position_during, seventy year history)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States. Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian, and brought the language to what is now Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies) and present day Malaysia and Singapore (formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements).

It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?) (also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Drac's Night Out is the title of an unreleased video game developed by Mark Lesser and Rex Bradford of Microsmiths that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (nintendo entertainment system, has_initial_release_name, family computer)\n- (family computer, released_in, japan)\n- (family computer, release_date, july 15, 1983)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, released_in, north america)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, north_america_release_year, 1985)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, released_in, europe)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, europe_release_year, 1986)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, released_in, australia)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, australia_release_year, 1987)\n- (pc engine, developed_by, nec home electronics)\n- (pc engine, release_date, japan 1987)\n- (mega drive, developed_by, sega enterprises)\n- (mega drive, release_date, japan 1988)\n- (turbografx-16, is_released_as, pc engine)\n- (turbografx-16, released_in, north america)\n- (turbografx-16, north_america_release_year, 1989)\n- (genesis, is_released_as, mega drive)\n- (genesis, released_in, north america)\n- (genesis, north_america_release_year, 1989)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, has_technical_specification, 8-bit architecture)\n- (pc engine, has_technical_specification, 16-bit architectures)\n- (mega drive, has_technical_specification, 16-bit architectures)\n- (pc engine, offers_improvement_over, nintendo entertainment system)\n- (mega drive, offers_improvement_over, nintendo entertainment system)\n- (drac's night out, developed_by, mark lesser)\n- (drac's night out, developed_by, rex bradford)\n- (drac's night out, company_of_developers, microsmiths)\n- (drac's night out, features_sponsorship_from, reebok pump shoe)\n- (nintendo executives, observes_market_dynamics, nintendo entertainment system)\n- (nintendo executives, responds_to_market_change, designing new system)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The missile can be launched from multiple platforms and is capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads. It is currently under development and undergoing flight trials. Hyderabad's role in the pearl trade has given it the name \"City of Pearls\" and up until the 18th century, the city was also the only global trading centre for large diamonds. Industrialisation began under the Nizams in the late 19th century, helped by railway expansion that connected the city with major ports. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Indian enterprises, such as Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), Bharat Electronics (BEL), Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) and Andhra Bank (AB) were established in the city. The city is home to Hyderabad Securities formerly known as Hyderabad Stock Exchange (HSE), and houses the regional office of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). In 2013, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) facility in Hyderabad was forecast to provide operations and transactions services to BSE-Mumbai by the end of 2014.

These influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion. During Spanish colonial rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to Roman Catholicism and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from Spanish trade between Mesoamerica and Asia. The modern Chamorro language is a Malayo-Polynesian language with much Spanish and Filipino influence. Many Chamorros also have Spanish surnames because of their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the adoption of names from the Cata\u0301logo alfabe\u0301tico de apellidos, a phenomenon also common to the Philippines. Many Christians still practice their traditional cultural beliefs and rituals along with Christianity. The Catholic Church has fused some aspects of local culture into its services. For example, the singing of hymns during services has developed into a local and traditional way of singing (a repetitive call and response style) in Sesotho, the indigenous language, as well as English. In addition priests are seen dressed in local dress during services. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (post-european-contact chamorro culture, has_program, american traditions program)\n- (american traditions program, targets, american traditions)\n- (post-european-contact chamorro culture, has_program, spanish traditions program)\n- (spanish traditions program, targets, spanish traditions)\n- (post-european-contact chamorro culture, has_program, filipino traditions program)\n- (filipino traditions program, targets, filipino traditions)\n- (post-european-contact chamorro culture, has_program, micronesian islander influences program)\n- (micronesian islander influences program, targets, micronesian islander influences)\n- (post-european-contact chamorro culture, has_program, mexican traditions program)\n- (mexican traditions program, targets, mexican traditions)\n- (post-european-contact chamorro culture, requires, indigenous pre-hispanic customs)\n- (indigenous pre-hispanic customs, has_amount, few)\n- (local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (batu, chonka, estuleks, bayogu), songs and fashion, reflects, cultural influences)\n- (spanish colonial rule, lasted_from_to, 1668 to 1898)\n- (the majority of the population, was_converted_to, roman catholicism)\n- (roman catholicism, during_period, spanish colonial rule)\n- (easter, christmas, became widespread due to conversion to, christianity)\n- (post-contact chamorro cuisine, is_based_on, corn)\n- (tortillas, tamales, atole, chilaquiles, are part of, post-contact chamorro cuisine)\n- (spanish trade between mesoamerica and asia, influenced, chamorro cuisine)\n- (the modern chamorro language, is_a, malayo-polynesian language)\n- (malayo-polynesian language, with_influence_from, spanish influence)\n- (the modern chamorro language, has_influence_from, filipino influence)\n- (many chamorros, have_surnames_due_to_conversion_to, roman catholic christianity)\n- (roman catholic christianity, adopted_surnames_from, cata\u0301logo alfabe\u0301tico de apellidos)\n- (some aspects of local culture, are_fused_into, catholic church services)\n- (hymns during services, are_sung_in_style, repetitive call and response style in sesotho, as well as english)\n- (priests, wear_during_services, local dress)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Katharina von Bora (; 29 January 1499 \u2013 20 December 1552), after her wedding Katharina Luther, also referred to as \"die Lutherin\" (\"the Lutheress\"), was the wife of Martin Luther, German reformer and a seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. Beyond what is found in the writings of Luther and some of his contemporaries, little is known about her.

Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was Ali's son from another wife from the Bani Hanifa tribe of central Arabia named Khawlah bint Ja'far, whom Ali had married after Fatimah's death. One account in Tabari says that the first male convert is Zayd ibn Harithah, a freed slave who had become Muhammad's adopted son. It is known that Ali is the first person to convert to Islam, however some dispute this arguing he was only 12 years old at the time he embraced Islam. Lebanon has several different main religions.

Founded in 1918, its declared aim was an ideology that would combine both \"vo\u0308lkisch\" and socialist elements. However, the party never became a mass movement. After it was dissolved in 1922, many of its members joined the similar National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) instead. In the aftermath of World War I and during the German Revolution of 1918 -- 19, Freikorps consisting largely of World War I veterans were raised as right - wing paramilitary militias, ostensibly to fight on behalf of the government against the Soviet - backed German Communists attempting to overthrow the Weimar Republic. However, the Freikorps also despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters. The Freikorps were widely seen as a precursor to Nazism, and many of their volunteers ended up joining the Nazi militia, the Sturmabteilung (SA).

Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin. Jean Mathonet (6 October 1925, Be\u0301verce\u0301, Malmedy \u2013 22 October 2004, Malmedy) was a Belgian football player who finished top scorer of the Belgian First Division with 26 goals in 1956 while playing for Standard Lie\u0300ge. He played 13 times with the Belgian national team between 1952 and 1958. Mathonet made his international debut on Christmas 1952 in a 0\u20131 friendly win against France.

With the completion of a pipeline connection to the oil terminal at Sullom Voe in Shetland, the storage facility had continued in use, but by 1991, was considered to be of no further value. Brent Spar became an issue of public concern in 1995, when the British government announced its support for Shell's application for its disposal in deep Atlantic waters at North Feni Ridge (approximately from the west coast of Scotland, at a depth of around ). On 27 August 2007, Royal Dutch Shell and Reitan Group, the owner of the 7-Eleven brand in Scandinavia, announced an agreement to re-brand some 269 service stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals under the different competition laws in each country. On April 2010 Shell announced that the corporation is in process of trying to find a potential buyer for all of its operations in Finland and is doing similar market research concerning Swedish operations.

Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, \"He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures\" (Natural History, Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the Galatians, were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage. The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander's youthful look. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period, including Laocoo\u0308n and his Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year.

The Scion xD and the second generation xB were first shown to the public on February 8, 2007 at the Chicago Auto Show. The xD appeared in Scion showrooms in mid-2007 in the USA and in 2011 for Canada. The Scion xD was discontinued in 2014, and was succeeded by the Toyota C-HR in 2017. A facelift was designed through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801 - 0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (scion xd, is marketed in, u.s.)\n- (u.s., has_market_for, scion xd)\n- (toyota, markets, scion xd)\n- (canada, has_market_for, scion xd)\n- (xa, is replaced by, scion xd)\n- (scion xd, was first shown to the public on, february 8, 2007)\n- (second generation xb, was first shown to the public on, february 8, 2007)\n- (chicago auto show, featured, scion xd)\n- (chicago auto show, featured, second generation xb)\n- (scion xd, appeared in showrooms in, mid-2007)\n- (u.s., has_showroom_for, scion xd)\n- (scion xd, appeared in showrooms in, 2011)\n- (canada, has_showroom_for, scion xd)\n- (toyota c-hr, succeeds, scion xd)\n- (late 2010, received_facelift_of, scion xd)\n- (facelift of scion xd, patented on, january 7, 2011)\n- (january 7, 2011, has_patent_for, facelift of scion xd)\n- (patent design registration number 001845801 - 0004, is_registered_to, toyota)\n- (facelift of scion xd, unveiled at, march 2012 geneva motor show)\n- (march 2012 geneva motor show, featured, facelift of scion xd)\n- (scion xd, includes, new led running lights)\n- (led running lights, are_part_of, scion xd)\n- (f sport version of scion xd, features, honeycomb grille)\n- (honeycomb grille, is_feature_of, f sport version of scion xd)\n- (f sport version of scion xd, uses, 8-speed automatic transmission)\n- (8-speed automatic transmission, is_used_by, f sport version of scion xd)\n- (f sport version of scion xd, has, unique sporty interior)\n- (unique sporty interior, is_feature_of, f sport version of scion xd)\n- (new model in u.s., uses, lexus enform telematics system)\n- (lexus enform telematics system, includes, safety connect sos system)\n- (safety connect sos system, is_part_of, lexus enform telematics system)\n- (shazam tagging, is_feature_of, lexus enform telematics system)\n- (rx 350 model, sales started in, april 2012)\n- (april 2012, has_sales_start_for, rx 350 model)\n- (rx 450h model, sales started in, april 2012)\n- (april 2012, has_sales_start_for, rx 450h model)\n- (f sport version of scion xd, sales started in, july 2012)\n- (july 2012, has_sales_start_for, f sport version of scion xd)\n- (some buyers, lamented, small size of first japanese compacts)\n- (first japanese compacts, are_compared_to, toyota corona mark ii)\n- (toyota, introduced, toyota corona mark ii)\n- (toyota, introduced, toyota cressida)\n- (mazda, introduced, mazda 616)\n- (datsun, introduced, datsun 810)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. Before the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: Hejaz (Tihamah), Najd (Al - Yamama), Southern Arabia (Hadhramaut) and Eastern Arabia. Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of Yemen and some parts of Saudi Arabia (Najran, Jizan, Asir) and Oman (Dhofar). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area.

Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated.

Roncalli left Venice for the conclave in Rome well aware that he was papabile,[b] and after eleven ballots, was elected to succeed the late Pius XII, so it came as no surprise to him, though he had arrived at the Vatican with a return train ticket to Venice.[citation needed] The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is a 1558 painting by Titian, now in the church of I Gesuiti in Venice. It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial.

Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror (The Tomb of Dracula), martial arts, (Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu), sword-and-sorcery (Conan the Barbarian, Red Sonja), satire (Howard the Duck) and science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey, \"Killraven\" in Amazing Adventures, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount. Howard the Duck is a 1986 American comic science fiction film directed by Willard Huyck and starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins. Based on the Marvel comic book of the same title, the film was produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz, with George Lucas as executive producer. The screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film, but the film adaptation became live-action because of a contractual obligation.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (marvel, has_program, diversification program)\n- (diversification program, includes, horror themed titles)\n- (horror themed titles, includes, tomb of dracula)\n- (martial arts themed titles, includes, shang-chi master of kung fu)\n- (sword and sorcery themed titles, includes, conan the barbarian)\n- (sword and sorcery themed titles, includes, red sonja)\n- (satire themed titles, includes, howard the duck)\n- (science fiction themed titles, includes, 2001 a space odyssey)\n- (science fiction themed titles, includes, killraven in amazing adventures)\n- (science fiction themed titles, includes, battlestar galactica)\n- (science fiction themed titles, includes, star trek series)\n- (science fiction themed titles, includes, star wars series)\n- (marvel, has_program, price and format change program)\n- (price and format change program, occurred_in, november 1971)\n- (november 1971, increased_price_of, marvel comics from 15 cents to 25 cents)\n- (november 1971, changed_size_of, marvel comics from 36 pages to 52 pages)\n- (price and format change program, occurred_in, december 1971)\n- (december 1971, decreased_price_of, marvel comics to 20 cents for 36 pages)\n- (howard the duck film, has_director, willard huyck)\n- (howard the duck film, has_producer, gloria katz)\n- (howard the duck film, stars, lea thompson)\n- (howard the duck film, stars, jeffrey jones)\n- (howard the duck film, stars, tim robbins)\n- (george lucas, served_as, executive producer on howard the duck)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Beyonce\u0301 appeared as Jay Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, which would further fuel speculation of their relationship. On April 4, 2008, Beyonce\u0301 and Jay Z were married without publicity. As of April 2014, the couple have sold a combined 300 million records together. The couple are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years. Beyonce\u0301 suffered a miscarriage in 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music in order to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyonce\u0301 and Jay Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for her 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.

The first year (1914) it went mainstream, the Socialist party had 27 more registered members than the Prohibition Party, who were some members of the Suffrage movement. The Socialist party was similar to the Progressive Party in the county, as it tried from the outskirts of government to make change. While Socialism failed its first year, it still received attention from the press who was aware of the October Revolution (1918) in Russia (Now the Soviet Union) by a similarly named government led by Vladimir Lenin. Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, more commonly referred to locally as the ``West Hills '', pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. Council Crest Park, commonly thought of as the highest point within city limits, is in the West Hills and rises to an elevation of 1,073 feet (327 m) The city's actual high point is a little - known and infrequently accessed point (1,180 feet) near Forest Park. The highest point east of the river is Mt. Tabor, an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to 636 feet (194 m). Nearby Powell Butte and Rocky Butte rise to 614 feet (187 m) and 612 feet (187 m), respectively. To the west of the Tualatin Mountains lies the Oregon Coast Range, and to the east lies the actively volcanic Cascade Range. On clear days, Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens dominate the horizon, while Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier can also be seen in the distance.

Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that the representatives of the Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa. Archaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived in more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing.

Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang. During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by Grazio Braccioli. In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.

(sometimes known as Sony Music or by the initials, SME) is an American music corporation managed and operated by Sony Corporation of America (SCA), a subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate Sony Corporation.

In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. In 1987, Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company, and in 1991, renamed it SME. It is the world's second largest recorded music company, after Universal Music Group. Around the start of the 20th century, a growing population of Asian Americans lived in or near Santa Monica and Venice. A Japanese fishing village was located near the Long Wharf while small numbers of Chinese lived or worked in both Santa Monica and Venice. The two ethnic minorities were often viewed differently by White Americans who were often well-disposed towards the Japanese but condescending towards the Chinese. The Japanese village fishermen were an integral economic part of the Santa Monica Bay community.

It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (\"nurturing mother of studies\"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus, a term used for a university graduate that literally means a \"nursling\" or \"one who is nourished\". Hillcrest High School is a high school located at 3319 N. Grant Avenue in Springfield, Missouri. Hillcrest High School is one of five public high schools in Springfield Public Schools. It is located in the north part of Springfield. It was opened in 1958. As of 2015, there was an enrollment of 1,054 students, making it the smallest of the five public high schools in Springfield. The Alma Mater is a bronze statue by sculptor Lorado Taft, a beloved symbol of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The 10,000-pound statue depicts a mother-figure wearing academic robes and flanked by two attendant figures representing \"Learning\" and \"Labor\", after the University's motto \"Learning and Labor.\" Sited at the corner of Green and Wright Streets at the heart of the campus, the statue is an iconic figure for the university and a popular backdrop for student graduation photos. It is appreciated for its romantic, heraldic overtones and warmth of pose. The statue was removed from its site at the entrance to the university for restoration in 2012 and was returned to its site in the spring of 2014.

Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the ``Long Nine ''for their combined height of 54 feet (16 m).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (springfield, has_program, original name change program)\n- (original name change program, has_amount, 1832)\n- (original name change program, targets, calhoun)\n- (calhoun, has_program, naming origin program)\n- (naming origin program, has_amount, john c. calhoun)\n- (naming origin program, targets, senator of south carolina)\n- (springfield, has_program, settlement history program)\n- (settlement history program, has_amount, 1818)\n- (settlement history program, targets, trappers and traders)\n- (springfield, has_program, first cabin building program)\n- (first cabin building program, has_amount, 1820)\n- (first cabin building program, targets, john kelly at second street and jefferson street)\n- (calhoun, has_program, county seat designation program)\n- (county seat designation program, has_amount, 1821)\n- (county seat designation program, targets, sangamon county due to fertile soil and trading opportunities)\n- (springfield, has_program, settlers origin program)\n- (settlers origin program, has_amount, kentucky, virginia, north carolina)\n- (settlers origin program, targets, springfield settlement)\n- (springfield, has_program, massachusetts influence program)\n- (massachusetts influence program, has_amount, industrial innovation and prosperity)\n- (massachusetts influence program, targets, springfield's development)\n- (kaskaskia, has_program, first capital designation program)\n- (first capital designation program, has_amount, 1809)\n- (first capital designation program, targets, illinois territory)\n- (kaskaskia, has_program, statehood continuation program)\n- (statehood continuation program, has_amount, 1818 and 1819)\n- (statehood continuation program, targets, first year as a state)\n- (vandalia, has_program, second capital designation program)\n- (second capital designation program, has_amount, 1819 to 1839)\n- (second capital designation program, targets, illinois state)\n- (springfield, has_program, third capital designation program)\n- (third capital designation program, has_amount, 1839)\n- (third capital designation program, targets, current capital due to lincoln's efforts)\n- (abraham lincoln, has_program, long nine associates program)\n- (long nine associates program, has_amount, 54 feet (16 m))\n- (long nine associates program, targets, the long nine)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His mother was an offspring of the influential Bunnag family, the daughter of Thet Bunnag (later Chao Phraya Suraphan Phisut), making him a direct descendant of Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse. Controversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Leh to make it more ``paradise - like ''. The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (bang bon, has_district_status, bangkok district)\n- (bangkok district, includes, bang khae district)\n- (bangkok district, includes, phasi charoen district)\n- (bangkok district, includes, chom thong district)\n- (bangkok district, includes, bang khun thian district)\n- (samut sakhon province, includes, mueang samut sakhon district)\n- (samut sakhon province, includes, krathum baen district)\n- (bangkok district, includes, nong khaem district)\n- (bang bon, has_neighbourhoods, bangkok district network)\n- (bang bon, is_in, thailand)\n- (siddhi savetsila, was_born_in, bangkok)\n- (siddhi savetsila, has_father, high-ranking official in the royal government of thailand)\n- (high-ranking official in the royal government of thailand, father_of, siddhi savetsila)\n- (henry alabaster, served_as_consul_in, siam during king rama iv\u2019s reign)\n- (king rama iv, had_consul, henry alabaster)\n- (henry alabaster, also_served_as_advisor_to, king rama v (chulalongkorn))\n- (siddhi savetsila, has_maternal_grandfather, thet bunnag (later chao phraya suraphan phisut))\n- (thet bunnag (later chao phraya suraphan phisut), is_member_of, bunnag family)\n- (somdet chao phraya borom maha prayurawongse, ancestor_of, siddhi savetsila)\n- (king rama v (chulalongkorn), had_advisor, henry alabaster)\n- (20th century fox, altered_natural_setting_on, ko phi phi leh during film production)\n- (ko phi phi leh, has_beach, natural beach setting)\n- (20th century fox, bulldozed_parts_of, ko phi phi leh island)\n- (20th century fox, landscaped_parts_of, ko phi phi leh island to make it more \"paradise-like\")\n- (20th century fox, altered_sand_dunes_on, ko phi phi leh)\n- (20th century fox, cleared_coconut_trees_and_grass_from, ko phi phi leh to widen the beach)\n- (20th century fox, set_aside_fund_for, reconstruction and returning the beach to its natural state on ko phi phi leh)\n- (environmentalists, filed_lawsuits_over, damage believed permanent and restoration attempts failed by 20th century fox)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fla\u0308ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (wittenberg, has_location_in, saxony-anhalt)\n- (saxony-anhalt, is_part_of, germany)\n- (wittenberg, borders_with, anhalt-bitterfeld)\n- (wittenberg, borders_with, dessau-ro\u00dflau)\n- (wittenberg, borders_with, potsdam-mittelmark)\n- (wittenberg, borders_with, teltow-fla\u0308ming)\n- (wittenberg, borders_with, elbe-elster)\n- (wittenberg, borders_with, nordsachsen)\n- (martin luther, initiated, protestant reformation)\n- (protestant reformation, includes_document, ninety-five theses)\n- (ninety-five theses, criticizes_concept, indulgences)\n- (ninety-five theses, criticizes_concept, pope's authority over purgatory)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporates_doctrine, sola scriptura)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporates_doctrine, sola fide)\n- (theological motivations, influenced, protestant reformation)\n- (nationalism, was_driving_force_for, protestant reformation)\n- (western schism, contributed_to, protestant reformation)\n- (corruption in the roman curia, fueled, protestant reformation)\n- (humanism, supported, protestant reformation)\n- (renaissance learning, supported, protestant reformation)\n- (martin luther, opposed_doctrine, certain aspects of catholic doctrine)\n- (martin luther, adhered_to, church dogmas)\n- (martin luther, believed_in, mary's perpetual virginity)\n- (mary, is_title_of, theotokos or mother of god)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Vincentas Sladkevic\u030cius, MIC (20 August 1920 \u2013 28 May 2000) was a Lithuanian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (luther, has_program, early beliefs program)\n- (early beliefs program, targets, mary's perpetual virginity)\n- (mary, is_titled_as, theotokos)\n- (theotokos, shares_context_with, mother of god)\n- (luther, adheres_to, immaculate conception three centuries before dogmatization)\n- (immaculate conception three centuries before dogmatization, context_involves, pope pius ix)\n- (luther, changes_view_on, immaculate conception later life)\n- (immaculate conception later life, involves, historical timeline)\n- (luther, believes_in, assumption of mary understood fact)\n- (assumption of mary understood fact, stops_celebrating_feast_due_to, lack of biblical support)\n- (luther, believes_saints_live_on_after_death, includes belief about mary and others)\n- (believes saints live on after death, connects_with, broader beliefs about the afterlife)\n- (luther, integrates_theological_beliefs_with_professional_roles, involves priest professor reformer role)\n- (integrates theological beliefs with professional roles, focuses_on, christocentric theology)\n- (luther, criticizes_roman_catholics_for_practices, includes celebrating saints days and intercessory requests to mary)\n- (criticizes roman catholics for practices, contrasts_with, lutheran views on marian devotion)\n- (luther, final_thoughts_preserved_in_sermon_at_wittenberg, involves lifelong theological reflections)\n- (final thoughts preserved in sermon at wittenberg, encapsulates, summary of life work)\n- (vincentas sladkevic\u030cius, is_lithuanian_cardinal_with_specific_dates, includes 20 august 1920 to 28 may 2000)\n- (is lithuanian cardinal with specific dates, context_involves, catholic church history)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. As a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Sainty, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA.

The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832. There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Cla\u0301sico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (spain, ceded_to, british)\n- (british, controlled_in_year, 1763)\n- (french and indian war, ended_with_cession_of_florida, spain to british)\n- (the king's road, built_by, british)\n- (the king's road, connects, st augustine georgia connection)\n- (the king's road, crosses_at, wacca pilatka crossing point)\n- (wacca pilatka crossing point, also_known_as, cow ford cowford)\n- (cattle, transported_across, st johns river)\n- (st johns river transportation, occurred_at, cow ford cowford)\n- (british, introduced_cultivation_of, sugar cane in florida)\n- (sugar cane cultivation, took_place_in, florida)\n- (british, introduced_cultivation_of, indigo in florida)\n- (indigo cultivation, occurred_in, florida)\n- (british, introduced_cultivation_of, fruit in florida)\n- (fruit cultivation, took_place_in, florida)\n- (british, exported_from, lumber from florida)\n- (lumber export, originated_from, florida)\n- (northeastern florida, prospered_under_control_of, british rule)\n- (economic prosperity comparison, compared_to_spanish_rule, northeastern florida)\n- (britain, ceded_territory_back_to, spain in 1783)\n- (the american revolutionary war, ended_with_cession_of_florida, britain to spain)\n- (american settlers, planned_town_at, north side of cow ford)\n- (town planning location, named_after, andrew jackson)\n- (residents, wrote_charter_for, town government)\n- (charter written by residents, led_by, isaiah d hart)\n- (florida legislative council, approved_charter_on, february 9 1832)\n- (charter approval date, occurred_on, february 9 1832)\n- (top teams in la liga, have_rivalry_between, barcelona and real madrid)\n- (rivalry exists between, top_teams_in_la_liga, barcelona and real madrid)\n- (barcelona vs real madrid match, known_as, el clasico)\n- (the clasicos match, between_teams, barcelona and real madrid)\n- (barcelona, represents_region_of, catalonia)\n- (real madrid, represents_region_of, castile)\n- (rivalry between teams, reflects_tensions_between, catalans and castilians)\n- (tensions reflected in rivalry, between_regions, catalonia and castile)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade.

A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus. The original USB 1.0 specification, which was introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5 Mbit/s \"Low Speed\" and 12 Mbit/s \"Full Speed\". Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12 Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5 Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself.

According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang.

It was initially intended as a creative outlet for the Beatles, both as a group and individually, plus a selection of other artists including Mary Hopkin, James Taylor, Badfinger, and Billy Preston. In practice, the roster had become dominated by the mid-1970s with releases of the former Beatles as solo artists. Allen Klein managed the label from 1969 to 1973, then it was managed by Neil Aspinall on behalf of the Beatles and their heirs. Aspinall retired in 2007 and was replaced by Jeff Jones. Magic Christian Music is the debut album by the British rock band Badfinger, released in early 1970 on Apple Records. Three tracks from the LP are featured in the film \"The Magic Christian\", which also gives the album its title.

The senior officials in the Office of the Secretary are the Under Secretary of the Air Force, four Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force and the General Counsel, all of whom are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The senior uniformed leadership in the Air Staff is made up of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 2 independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats. Republicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President's party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. This also happened to be the Republicans' largest gain in House seats since 1938. Republicans gained the most in New York state where they picked up six seats, defeating five incumbents and winning an open Democratic district. The heavy Democratic Party losses were attributed to anger with President Obama, opposition to the Affordable Care Act, large budget deficits and the weak economy.

Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Jean Hengen (23 November 1912 \u2013 29 January 2005) was a Luxembourgian prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (he, has_belief, perpetual virginity of mary)\n- (perpetual virginity of mary, is_aspect_of, marian devotion)\n- (he, believes_in, assumption of mary early in life)\n- (assumption of mary, is_fact_for, luther's early belief)\n- (he, states, bible does not mention assumption of mary)\n- (bible, lacks_mention_of, assumption of mary feast)\n- (he, was_adherent_of, immaculate conception view before 1854)\n- (others, claim_later_change_in, luther's stance on immaculate conception)\n- (luther, maintained_mary_sinlessness_through_life, later in life)\n- (he, preached_about, veneration of mary throughout career)\n- (mary, and_saints_live_on_after_death, according to luther)\n- (roman catholics, practice_celebrating, saints' days)\n- (he, considered_practice_idolatry, roman catholic celebration of saints' days)\n- (jean hengen, was_living_from, 23 november 1912 until 29 january 2005)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Written by Grande, Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and Ilya, it was released by Republic Records as the album's lead single on April 20, 2018, alongside its music video. Commercially, the song has topped the charts in Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, and Slovakia and reached the top five in Austria, Canada, Germany, Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. The music video was filmed in early January 2015 and it also stars Matt Bennett, who was also Grande's co-star from the Nickelodeon sitcom Victorious. Max Landis also confirmed that one of the voices of the news reporters in the beginning of the video was actress Elizabeth Gillies, who also co-starred in Victorious with Grande and Bennett. Gillies previously appeared Grande's music video for her single ``Right There ''(2013). Around that time, Max Landis revealed`` One Last Time'' as Grande's next single after tweeting, ``Earth will pass catastrophically through the tail of the comet Eurydice in one week. Gather family and lovers close, one... last... time ''.

He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes wavelength and amplitude. This phenomenon, subsequently known as Raman scattering, results from the Raman effect. In 1954, the Indian government honoured him with India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. A.P.J.

Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River. The southern border is defined as the 36\u00b0 30\u2032 parallel north, though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes. The border with Tennessee was not settled until 1893, when their dispute was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court. Newport News is included in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. It is at the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, on the northern shore of the James River extending southeast from Skiffe's Creek along many miles of waterfront to the river's mouth at Newport News Point on the harbor of Hampton Roads. The area now known as Newport News was once a part of Warwick County. Warwick County was one of the eight original shires of Virginia, formed by the House of Burgesses in the British Colony of Virginia by order of King Charles I in 1634. The county was largely composed of farms and undeveloped land until almost 250 years later.

It consists of linked stories featuring Timothy Cone, who works as a hard-boiled type investigator. He is a scruffy character, rough of mouth and demeanor but pure of heart. Cone has trouble with relationships, surviving on a rough-edged on-going affair with his supervisor, and an only slightly softer relationship with his cat Cleo. The stories in the book deal with his successful attempts to find out the truth and put villains behind bars. The Anderson Tapes is the debut crime fiction novel by Lawrence Sanders, published in 1970. The story revolves around the complicated burglary of an entire upscale New York apartment building by a gang of ex-convicts, who are unaware that the entire operation is under wiretap and camera surveillance by various agencies. The story also introduces the character of NYPD police detective Edward X. Delaney who became Sander's enduring protagonist in his \"Deadly Sin\" series of novels. The book earned Sanders the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for best first mystery novel. The same year, it was adapted into a film, directed by Sidney Lumet, with Sean Connery in the title role.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (lawrence sanders, has_work, the timothy files)\n- (the timothy files, includes_character, timothy cone)\n- (timothy cone, works_as_investigator_in, the timothy files)\n- (timothy cone, is_described_as, scruffy rough of mouth and demeanor but pure of heart)\n- (timothy cone, has_trouble_with, relationships)\n- (timothy cone, survives_on, ongoing affair with supervisor)\n- (timothy cone, relationship_is_softer_than, relationship with cleo)\n- (the timothy files, includes_character, cleo)\n- (cleo, is_cat_of, timothy cone)\n- (lawrence sanders, has_work, the anderson tapes)\n- (the anderson tapes, was_published_in, 1970)\n- (the anderson tapes, introduces_character, edward x. delaney)\n- (edward x. delaney, is_main_character_in, the anderson tapes)\n- (the anderson tapes, earned_award_for, mystery writers of america edgar award for best first mystery novel)\n- (the anderson tapes, was_adapted_into_film, film adaptation)\n- (lawrence sanders, has_series_with_enduring_protagonist, edward x. delaney in deadly sin series)\n- (sidney lumet, directed_film_adaptation_of, the anderson tapes)\n- (sean connery, played_role_in_film_adaptation_of, the anderson tapes)\n- (edward x. delaney, is_title_role_in_film_adaptation_of, the anderson tapes)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. A Doi is a village in south-eastern Laos near the border with Vietnam. It is located in Kaleum District in Sekong Province. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years.

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille.

One private CBC affiliate, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, joined E! (then known as CH) on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O&O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and CFJC-TV in Kamloops, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat disaffiliated on August 31, 2008 and joined E!, but the CBC announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, Jim Pattison Group. With the closure of E! and other changes in the media landscape, several former CBC affiliates have since joined City or Global, or closed altogether. Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (chbc-tv, has_program, e! network program)\n- (e! network program, occurred_on, february 27, 2006)\n- (cfjc-tv, disaffiliated_from, cbc on february 27, 2006)\n- (cfjc-tv, agreed_with, chbc-tv's affiliation with e!)\n- (ckpg-tv, disaffiliated_from, cbc on august 31, 2008)\n- (chat-tv, disaffiliated_from, cbc on august 31, 2008)\n- (ckpg-tv and chat-tv, joined_network, e! network)\n- (cbc o&o stations, has_minor_variations, few regional differences)\n- (private cbc affiliates, transitioned_to, other networks or purchased by media companies)\n- (many private affiliates, closed_due_to, changes in media landscape)\n- (retransmitter policy, applies_when, affiliate disaffiliation occurs)\n- (cfjc-tv's disaffiliation, no_retransmitters_installed_for, this event)\n- (most cbc stations, use_brand, cbc brand rather than call letters)\n- (cblt toronto, does_not_id_itself_except_through, psip)\n- (chbc-tv, influenced_cfjc-tv_to_disaffiliate_from, cbc due to agreement)\n- (ownership changes, involved_entities, jim pattison group owns cfjc-tv, ckpg-tv, and chat-tv)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

Eric (Kevin James) claims he is now a co-owner of a lawn furniture company, but is disappointed in his wife Sally (Maria Bello) for continuing to breastfeed Bean (Morgan Gingerich), one of his two children, the other being Donna (Ada - Nicole Sanger). Kurt (Chris Rock) is a stay - at - home father with two children, Andre and Charlotte (Nadji Jeter and China Anne McClain). His wife Deanne (Maya Rudolph), the primary breadwinner of the family, is pregnant with another child and shares the house with her mother (Ebony Jo - Ann). Rob (Rob Schneider), nicknamed Carrot, has been divorced three times and holds custody of his daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget (Madison Riley, Jamie Chung, and Ashley Loren). His current wife, Gloria (Joyce Van Patten), is 30 years older than him. Marcus (David Spade) is a slacker and lothario. All five friends regularly harass each other in comedic fashion throughout the film: Lenny for being rich, Eric for being overweight, Kurt for being skinny and useless, Rob for his continuous use of the joke`` Maize!''\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (lenny, has_program, 1978 junior high basketball championship)\n- (1978 junior high basketball championship, includes, eric)\n- (1978 junior high basketball championship, includes, kurt)\n- (1978 junior high basketball championship, includes, rob)\n- (1978 junior high basketball championship, includes, marcus)\n- (lenny, has_program, 1978 celebration program)\n- (1978 celebration program, takes_place_at, lake house)\n- (lenny, has_coach, blake clark)\n- (blake clark, nicknamed_by, buzzer)\n- (buzzer, encourages, lenny)\n- (buzzer, encourages, eric)\n- (buzzer, encourages, kurt)\n- (buzzer, encourages, rob)\n- (buzzer, encourages, marcus)\n- (lenny, becomes, hollywood talent agent)\n- (roxanne, is_spouse_of, lenny)\n- (roxanne, has_occupation, fashion designer)\n- (becky, is_child_of, lenny and roxanne)\n- (greg, is_child_of, lenny and roxanne)\n- (keith, is_child_of, lenny and roxanne)\n- (lenny, annoyed_by, greg's spoiled behavior)\n- (lenny, annoyed_by, keith's spoiled behavior)\n- (eric, owns, lawn furniture company)\n- (bean, is_child_of, eric)\n- (donna, is_child_of, eric)\n- (sally, breastfeeds, bean)\n- (andre, is_child_of, kurt)\n- (charlotte, is_child_of, kurt)\n- (deanne, is_spouse_of, kurt)\n- (deanne, pregnant_with, another child)\n- (deanne, shares_house_with, mother)\n- (rob, nicknamed_by, carrot)\n- (jasmine, is_daughter_of, rob)\n- (amber, is_daughter_of, rob)\n- (bridget, is_daughter_of, rob)\n- (gloria, is_spouse_of, rob)\n- (gloria, 30_years_older_than, rob)\n- (marcus, described_as, slacker and lothario)\n- (lenny, harassed_by_friends_for, being rich)\n- (eric, harassed_by_friends_for, being overweight)\n- (kurt, harassed_by_friends_for, being skinny)\n- (kurt, harassed_by_friends_for, being useless)\n- (rob, harassed_by_friends_for, using maize joke)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial. Following the death of Pope Pius XII on 9 October 1958, Roncalli watched the live funeral on his last full day in Venice on 11 October.

The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961. The BBWAA does not offer a clear - cut definition of what ``most valuable ''means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters. The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City; the other club is the National League (NL)'s New York Mets. In the season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise that had ceased operations and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders.

Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela hot plugged a USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.\" Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon. On the 30th anniversary of the Forbes' list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.

The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. Colorful Dragon (), is a maze game developed and published by Sachen for the Nintendo Entertainment System on 1989 in Asia. Bunch Games later licensed the game for distribution in North America for a 1990 release, and published it as Tagin' Dragon. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo.

The remaining states are among the smallest in the U.S., including the smallest state -- Rhode Island. This is a list of the sixteen counties in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster - Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed. The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. The book was originally published in 1985.

Richard and a small force of little more than 2,000 men went to Jaffa by sea in a surprise attack. Richard's forces stormed Jaffa from their ships and the Ayyubids, who had been unprepared for a naval attack, were driven from the city. Richard freed those of the Crusader garrison who had been made prisoner, and these troops helped to reinforce the numbers of his army. Saladin's army still had numerical superiority, however, and they counter-attacked. Saladin intended a stealthy surprise attack at dawn, but his forces were discovered; he proceeded with his attack, but his men were lightly armoured and lost 700 men killed due to the missiles of the large numbers of Crusader crossbowmen. The battle to retake Jaffa ended in complete failure for Saladin, who was forced to retreat. This battle greatly strengthened the position of the coastal Crusader states.On 2 September 1192, following his defeat at Jaffa, Saladin was forced to finalize a treaty with Richard providing that Jerusalem would remain under Muslim control, while allowing unarmed Christian pilgrims and traders to visit the city.

Microsoft introduced Windows as a graphical user interface for MS - DOS, which had been introduced a couple of years earlier. In the 1990s, the product line evolved from an operating environment into a fully complete, modern operating system over two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase. The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998.

Jason, who was summoned with many others to take part in the sacrifice, lost one of his sandals in the flooded river Anaurus while rushing to Iolcus. In Virgil's Aeneid, Hera had disguised herself as an old woman, whom Jason was helping across the river when he lost his sandal. When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Fearful, Pelias asked Jason what he would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece. Pelias took Jason's advice and sent him to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It would be found at Colchis, in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war. Though the Golden Fleece simply hung on an oak tree, this was a seemingly impossible task, as an ever - watchful dragon guarded it. During Jason's absence, Pelias intended to kill Aeson. However, Aeson committed suicide by drinking bull's blood.

The 2017 Major League Baseball All - Star Game was the 88th edition of the Major League Baseball All Star Game. The game was hosted by the Miami Marlins and was played at Marlins Park on July 11, 2017. It was televised nationally by Fox. The game was the first since 2002 whose outcome did not determine home - field advantage for the World Series; instead, the team with the better regular - season record will have home - field advantage. The Marlins were announced as the hosts on February 10, 2015, by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred; the game was the Marlins' first time hosting, leaving the Tampa Bay Rays as the only MLB franchise not to have hosted an All - Star game. The Cleveland Indians are an American professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Indians compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. Since , they have played at Progressive Field. The team's spring training facility is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona. Since their establishment as a major league franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two World Series championships: in 1920 and 1948, along with 10 Central Division titles and six American League pennants.

On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements.

With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government.

He searches for food, water, and shelter, and opens the packages, finding a number of useful items. He leaves one package, which has a pair of angel wings stenciled on it, unopened. During a first attempt to make fire, Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. In anger and pain, he throws several objects, including a Wilson volleyball from one of the packages.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ``the predominant feature of Saudi culture '', with its global spread largely financed by the oil and gas trade. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called`` the Land of the Two Holy Mosques'' in reference to Al - Masjid al - Haram (in Mecca) and Al - Masjid an - Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam. As of 2013, the state had a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million were Saudi nationals and 8 million were foreigners. As of 2017, the population is 33 million. The state's official language is Arabic. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal.

The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts.

In 2008, Gates and president of Entertainment & Devices Robbie Bach announced a partnership with BT in the United Kingdom, in which the BT Vision advanced TV service, using the newer Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV platform, would be accessible via Xbox 360, planned for the middle of the year. BT Vision's DVR-based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity. In 2010, while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentioned that AT&T's U-verse IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set-top boxes later in the year. As of January 2010, IPTV on Xbox 360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials. The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998.

Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians. In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations (1948), Stalin published Falsifiers of History, which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left - leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (``Ones of the Majority '') led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (tsfsr, exists_from, 1922)\n- (tsfsr, exists_until, 1936)\n- (tsfsr, includes, armenian ssr)\n- (tsfsr, includes, azerbaijan ssr)\n- (tsfsr, includes, georgian ssr)\n- (1936 division of tsfsr, leads_to, formation of armenian ssr)\n- (1936 division of tsfsr, leads_to, formation of azerbaijan ssr)\n- (1936 division of tsfsr, leads_to, formation of georgian ssr)\n- (soviet rule, provides_provisions_for, armenians)\n- (provision from moscow, includes, medicine)\n- (provision from moscow, includes, food)\n- (provision from moscow, includes, other provisions)\n- (communist rule, contrasts_with, final years of ottoman empire)\n- (vladimir lenin, dies_in, 1924)\n- (joseph stalin, takes_power_after, vladimir lenin)\n- (stalin era, brings_fear_and_terror_for, armenians)\n- (1948 publication, includes, nazi soviet relations documents)\n- (falsifiers of history, denies_soviet_involvement_in, axis division claims)\n- (falsifiers of history version, persists_until, dissolution of soviet union)\n- (provisional government, holds_state_power_during, period of dual power)\n- (socialist political organizations, compete_for_influence_within, duma and soviets)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road Massacre. Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River. Most PLO fighters withdrew, but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over. The PLO soon resumed its policy of attacks against Israel. In the next few years, the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (tribal rulers, controlled, most of the area)\n- (al saud, emerged_as_minor_ruler_in, najd)\n- (al saud, influenced_by, wahhabi islamic movement)\n- (wahhabi islamic movement, led_to_expansionism_of, al saud)\n- (al saud, fluctuated_territory_over, 150 years)\n- (abdulaziz, carried_out_wars_of_conquest_between, 1902 and 1927)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, established_in, 1930)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, situated_in, southwest asia)\n- (saudi arabia, borders_on, persian gulf)\n- (saudi arabia, borders_on, red sea)\n- (saudi arabia, north_of, yemen)\n- (saudi arabia, occupies_percentage_of, 80% of arabian peninsula)\n- (saudi arabia, extensive_coastlines_provide_leverage_on, shipping through persian gulf and suez canal)\n- (al saud's expansionist policies, influenced_by, wahhabi islamic movement)\n- (abdulaziz\u2019s conquests between 1902 and 1927, directly_contributed_to_the_establishment_of, kingdom of saudi arabia in 1930)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Unlike Leo XIII, who addressed the condition of workers, Pius XI discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism, socialism, and totalitarian communism. He also calls for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. The name Vatican city was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city - state. The name is taken from Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state. ``Vatican ''is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden, located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager,`` Vatican territory''.

The Battle of Atlanta was a battle of the Atlanta Campaign fought during the American Civil War on July 22, 1864, just southeast of Atlanta, Georgia. Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply center of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman overwhelmed and defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John Bell Hood. Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed during the battle. Despite the implication of finality in its name, the battle occurred midway through the campaign, and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman's troops headed south - southeastward toward Milledgeville, the state capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea.

The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system\u2014the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's \"Ultra Games\" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?) (also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it. Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748. Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio (Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), Giuseppe Giuliano (Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), Emanuele Barbella (Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), Domenico Scarlatti (Sonata n.54 (K.89) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), and Addiego Guerra (Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo). Orlando furioso RV 819 (, Teatro San Angelo, Venice 1714) is a three-act opera surviving in manuscript in Antonio Vivaldi's personal library, only partly related to his better known Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727. It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.

Historically, the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades. However, from its foundation the party has identified itself as anti-socialist. Strong opposition to socialism and communism in Australia and abroad was one of its founding principles. The party's founder and longest-serving leader Robert Menzies envisaged that Australia's middle class would form its main constituency. The UAP had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the Lyons Government went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided Keynesian pump-priming and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941 but resigned as leader of the minority World War II government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 election.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (current liberal party, supports, economic liberalism)\n- (historical liberal party, supports, economic protectionism)\n- (historical liberal party, supports, interventionism)\n- (founding principle of the party, opposes, socialism)\n- (founding principle of the party, opposes, communism)\n- (robert menzies, envisioned, middle class as main constituency)\n- (uap, formed in, 1931)\n- (uap, is, conservative alliance)\n- (joseph lyons, was, labor defector)\n- (joseph lyons, led, uap)\n- (lyons, opposed, radical proposals for great depression)\n- (prominent australian conservatives, supported, lyons)\n- (australia, suffered from, great depression)\n- (uap, won landslide victory in, 1931 election)\n- (lyons government, avoided, keynesian pump-priming)\n- (lyons government, pursued, conservative fiscal policy)\n- (conservative fiscal policy, included, debt reduction)\n- (conservative fiscal policy, included, balanced budgets)\n- (joseph lyons, died in, 1939)\n- (robert menzies, assumed prime minister role in, 1939)\n- (menzies, was prime minister from, 1939 to 1941)\n- (menzies, resigned due to, unworkable parliamentary majority)\n- (uap, led by, billy hughes)\n- (uap, suffered heavy defeat in, 1943 election)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia. Because of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, anti-Communist governments. For example, Yugoslavia was the only communist country allowed to have an embassy in Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay. One notable exception to Yugoslavia's neutral stance toward anti-communist countries was Chile under Pinochet; Yugoslavia was one of many countries which severed diplomatic relations with Chile after Salvador Allende was overthrown. Yugoslavia also provided military aid and arms supplies to staunchly anti-Communist regimes such as that of Guatemala under Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garci\u0301a. Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President. Since the Militia Act of 1903 all National Guard soldiers have held dual status: as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and, when activated, as a reserve of the U.S. Army under the authority of the President.

The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City; the other club is the National League (NL)'s New York Mets. In the season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise that had ceased operations and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders. The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in . Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30). In the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia / Kansas City / Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series.

Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito - Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure. For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up - front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the Journal, received a ``chilly ''response from those involved. NFL is a 1989 football video game, developed by Atlus and published by LJN exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.

At its height, the Pinkerton Agency's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army.[citation needed] Because of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, anti-Communist governments. For example, Yugoslavia was the only communist country allowed to have an embassy in Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay. One notable exception to Yugoslavia's neutral stance toward anti-communist countries was Chile under Pinochet; Yugoslavia was one of many countries which severed diplomatic relations with Chile after Salvador Allende was overthrown. Yugoslavia also provided military aid and arms supplies to staunchly anti-Communist regimes such as that of Guatemala under Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garci\u0301a. Several accomplished professional tennis players including Ivan Lendl, Jan Kodes\u030c, Miloslav Mec\u030ci\u0301r\u030c, Hana Mandli\u0301kova\u0301, Martina Hingis, Martina Navratilova, Jana Novotna, Petra Kvitova\u0301 and Daniela Hantuchova\u0301 were born in Czechoslovakia. In 1968, Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubc\u030cek to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubc\u030cek needed help in facing down the Soviets. In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (policing in the american old west, has_quality, poor quality)\n- (the army, provides_policing, policing services)\n- (sheriffs, are_resourced, poorly resourced)\n- (posse, is_organized, temporarily organized)\n- (public organizations, are_supplemented_by, private contractors)\n- (numbers of pinkerton agency, exceed_numbers_of, united states army at peak time)\n- (yugoslavia, has_diplomatic_relations_with, right-wing governments)\n- (yugoslavia, is_unusual_for, communist countries)\n- (yugoslavia, had_embassy_in, paraguay under stroessner\u2019s rule)\n- (no other communist countries, were_allowed_to_have, embassies in paraguay under stroessner\u2019s rule)\n- (diplomatic relations between yugoslavia and chile, were_severed, after allende's overthrow)\n- (yugoslavia, provided_military_aid_to, guatemala)\n- (yugoslavia, supplied_arms_to, guatemala)\n- (ivan lendl, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (jan kodes\u030c, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (miloslav mec\u030ci\u0301r\u030c, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (hana mandli\u0301kova\u0301, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (martina hingis, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (martina navratilova, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (jana novotna, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (petra kvitova\u0301, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (daniela hantuchov\u00e1, was_born_in, czechoslovakia)\n- (tito, offered_flight_to, prague for dubc\u030cek)\n- (this offer by tito, was_made_on, three-hour notice)\n- (tito, removed_generals, ivan gos\u030cnjak and rade hamovic\u0301)\n- (reason for removal of generals, was_unpreparedness_of, yugoslav army)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (facelift, has_program, facelift design program)\n- (facelift design program, was_designed_through, late 2010 period)\n- (facelift design program, was_patented_on, 7 january 2011 date)\n- (facelift design program, has_design_registration_number, design registration number 001845801 - 0004 number)\n- (facelift design program, was_unveiled_at, march 2012 geneva motor show event)\n- (facelift, includes_feature, new wheels feature)\n- (new wheels feature, is_introduced_with, facelift design program)\n- (facelift, includes_feature, interior colors change)\n- (interior colors change, is_part_of, facelift design program)\n- (facelift, includes_feature, head and tail lamps addition)\n- (head and tail lamps addition, is_added_to, facelift design program)\n- (facelift, includes_feature, led running lights introduction)\n- (led running lights introduction, is_introduced_as_part_of, new features)\n- (f sport variant, has_program, f sport variant program)\n- (f sport variant program, features_honeycomb_grille, honeycomb grille feature)\n- (f sport variant program, includes_8_speed_transmission, 8-speed automatic transmission feature)\n- (f sport variant program, has_sporty_interior, sporty interior design)\n- (lexus enform telematics system, is_used_by, new model vehicle)\n- (new model vehicle, uses_technology_system, lexus enform telematics system)\n- (lexus enform telematics system, includes_feature, safety connect sos feature)\n- (safety connect sos feature, is_included_in, lexus enform telematics system)\n- (lexus enform telematics system, includes_feature, shazam tagging feature)\n- (rx 350 and rx 450h, has_sales_start_date, april 2012 date)\n- (rx 350 and rx 450h sales start date, begins_worldwide_sales_of, rx 350 model)\n- (rx 350 and rx 450h sales start date, begins_worldwide_sales_of, rx 450h model)\n- (f sport variant, has_sales_start_date, july 2012 date)\n- (hino dutro, is_manufactured_by, hino motors company)\n- (hino dutro, shares_model_with, toyota dyna vehicle)\n- (hino dutro, uses_platform_for_standard_cab, u300 platform)\n- (hino dutro, uses_platform_for_wide_cab, u400 platform)\n- (hino dutro, replaces_previous_models, ranger 2 model)\n- (hino dutro, replaces_previous_models, ranger 3 model)\n- (ranger 2 and ranger 3 models, are_based_on, daihatsu delta series original model)\n- (outside japan context, hino dutro is_known_as, '300 series' alternative name)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, was_introduced_by, toyota company)\n- (toyota cressida, was_introduced_by, toyota company)\n- (mazda 616, was_introduced_by, mazda company)\n- (datsun 810 model, is_now_known_as, nissan brand vehicle)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. As in most of eastern China the ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other minority nationalities. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui nationalities, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533) nationalities. Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435\u20131449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court.

A special class of guided missile destroyers was produced for the Shah of Iran, but due to the Iranian Revolution these ships could not be delivered and were added to the U.S. Navy.

John's second wife, Isabella of Angoule\u0302me, left England for Angoule\u0302me soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John. John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons \u2013 Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip \u2013 and three daughters \u2013 Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales. Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the abbey. In 1216, Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne, because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral. This coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the abbey on 17 May 1220. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the traditional cleric in the coronation ceremony.[citation needed]\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (john, has_wife, isabel)\n- (isabel, countess of gloucester, was released from imprisonment in, 1214)\n- (isabel, countess of gloucester, remarries, first marriage)\n- (isabel, countess of gloucester, supports, first marriage)\n- (isabel, countess of gloucester, remarries again, second marriage)\n- (isabel, countess of gloucester, supports, second marriage)\n- (isabel, countess of gloucester, died in, 1217)\n- (john, has_wife, isabella of angoule\u0302me)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, leaves_england_for, angoule\u0302me)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, supports, leaving england)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, supports, going to angoule\u0302me)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, becomes_powerful_leader_in, region)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, abandons_children_by_john, henry iii)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, supports, abandoning henry iii)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, abandons_children_by_john, richard)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, supports, abandoning richard)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, abandons_children_by_john, joan)\n- (isabella of angoule\u0302me, supports, abandoning joan)\n- (john, has_five_legitimate_children_all_by, isabella of angoule\u0302me)\n- (henry iii, is_eldest_son_of, john)\n- (henry iii, rules_as_king_in, early 13th century)\n- (henry iii, supports, ruling england)\n- (henry iii, supports, continuing to rule)\n- (richard, becomes_noted_leader_in, europe)\n- (richard, supports, becoming noted leader)\n- (richard, supports, becoming king)\n- (eleanor, youngest_daughter_of_john, first marries william marshal's son)\n- (eleanor, supports, marrying william marshal\u2019s son)\n- (eleanor, supports, marrying simon de montfort)\n- (joan, one_of_john's_illegitimate_daughters, married prince llywelyn the great of wales)\n- (coronations of english and british monarchs, traditionally_take_place_at, westminster abbey)\n- (westminster abbey, supports, hosting coronations)\n- (westminster abbey, supports, historical tradition)\n- (henry iii, supports, being crowned)\n- (louis, supports, controlling london)\n- (archbishop of canterbury, supports, participating in coronations)\n- (archbishop of canterbury, supports, tradition)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Mercer and Mancini wrote the song for Audrey Hepburn to sing in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. The lyrics, written by Mercer, are reminiscent of his childhood in Savannah, Georgia, including its waterways. As a child, he had picked huckleberries in summer, and connected them with a carefree childhood and Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654. Malchiostro Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Titian, completed around 1520, and housed in the Cathedral of Treviso, northern Italy. The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is a 1558 painting by Titian, now in the church of I Gesuiti in Venice. It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (plague in paris 1466 event, has_program, plague impact program)\n- (plague impact program, targets, population of paris)\n- (plague impact program, has_amount, significant number of people affected)\n- (frequency of plague in paris event, has_program, recurrence pattern program)\n- (recurrence pattern program, has_amount, 30 per cent of the time)\n- (recurrence pattern program, targets, paris during 16th and 17th centuries)\n- (black death spread event, has_program, spread across regions program)\n- (spread across regions program, includes, europe affected by black death)\n- (spread across regions program, includes, russia affected by black death)\n- (russia plague occurrences event, has_program, multiple occurrences program)\n- (multiple occurrences program, targets, plague in russia from 1350 to 1490)\n- (multiple occurrences program, has_amount, 25 times)\n- (london plague epidemics event, has_program, epidemic impact program)\n- (epidemic impact program, includes, plague outbreak in london in specific years)\n- (epidemic impact program, targets, population of london during outbreaks)\n- (amsterdam plague outbreaks event, has_program, outbreaks with significant mortality program)\n- (outbreaks with significant mortality program, includes, plague outbreak in amsterdam from 1623 to 1636)\n- (outbreaks with significant mortality program, targets, population loss in amsterdam during outbreaks)\n- (venice plague outbreaks event, has_program, multiple occurrences program)\n- (multiple occurrences program, targets, venice affected by plague from 1361 to 1528)\n- (multiple occurrences program, has_amount, 22 times)\n- (plague of 1576-77 in venice event, has_program, major outbreak impact program)\n- (major outbreak impact program, includes, plague outbreak in venice with high mortality)\n- (major outbreak impact program, targets, population loss in venice during 1576-77)\n- (italian plague and thirty years' war event, has_program, troop movements influence program)\n- (troop movements influence program, includes, italian plague spread influenced by thirty years' war)\n- (troop movements influence program, targets, spread of disease across conflict regions)\n- (great plague of vienna event, has_program, major outbreak impact program)\n- (major outbreak impact program, includes, plague outbreak in vienna in 1679)\n- (major outbreak impact program, targets, population loss in vienna during 1679)\n- (norway population loss event, has_program, mortality impact program)\n- (mortality impact program, includes, over 60% population loss in norway from 1348 to 1528)\n- (mortality impact program, targets, impact on norwegian society during black death period)\n- (oslo plague outbreak event, has_program, last major outbreak impact program)\n- (last major outbreak impact program, includes, plague outbreak in oslo in 1654)\n- (last major outbreak impact program, targets, historical significance and population loss in oslo)\n- (titian's paintings creation event, has_program, artistic works context program)\n- (artistic works context program, includes, malchiostro annunciation created during plague period)\n- (artistic works context program, includes, the martyrdom of saint lawrence created during plague period)\n- (artistic works context program, targets, titian's artistic response to plague)\n- (philip ii commissioning paintings event, has_program, royal patronage influence program)\n- (royal patronage influence program, includes, philip ii commissioned the martyrdom of saint lawrence for el escorial)\n- (royal patronage influence program, targets, impact on spanish art and culture during plague period)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Gilmer, Atlanta did indeed become the target of a major Union invasion. The area now covered by metropolitan Atlanta was the scene of several fiercely contested battles, including the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, Battle of Ezra Church and the Battle of Jonesboro. On September 1, 1864, Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood evacuated Atlanta, after a five - week siege mounted by Union Gen. William Sherman, and ordered all public buildings and possible Confederate assets destroyed. The city's population in 2010 was 44% white (33.3% non-Hispanic white), 25.5% black (23% non-Hispanic black), 0.7% Native American, and 12.7% Asian. Hispanics of any race represented 28.6% of the population, while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic white population declined 3 percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the Civil War, the number of blacks declined over a decade.

The Barclays Center in Brooklyn is home to the Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team. The Nets began playing in Brooklyn in 2012, the first major professional sports team to play in the historic borough in half a century. Before the merger of the defunct American Basketball Association with the NBA during the 1976 -- 1977 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home stadium (Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two - time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward Julius Erving. During the first season of the merger (1976 -- 77), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012 -- 2013 NBA season.

Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The Minikahda Club is a golf club and course located in southwest Minneapolis, Minnesota, just west of Lake Calhoun. The course hosted the U.S. Open in 1916, the U.S. Amateur in 1927, and the Walker Cup in 1957. Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle. As of 2018, Minneapolis was home to 6 Fortune 500 companies, and the Twin Cities were the fifth-largest hub of major corporate headquarters in the United States.

Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.

But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly larger than the Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3 percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8 percent was Muslim, and 1.9 percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5 percent of the total population is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5 percent, and that 7.7 percent are members of other religious groups. The Armenians collective has, at times, constituted a Christian \"island\" in a mostly Muslim region. There is, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race, while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years. The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States. Later on, the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin, the original seat of the Catholicosate. In 1441, a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi, while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia.

This weather effect occurs anywhere from once to several times a year, mostly in summer but sometimes in winter. The resulting wind typically creates large sandstorms that impact Iraq, most sand having been picked up from Jordan and Syria.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. The area of modern - day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al - Ahsa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ``the predominant feature of Saudi culture '', with its global spread largely financed by the oil and gas trade.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (saudi arabia, has_program, geographical boundaries)\n- (geographical boundaries, includes, persian gulf and red sea borders)\n- (geographical boundaries, requires, undefined boundaries with uae oman yemen)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, government formation)\n- (government formation, supports, founding in 1932 by ibn saud)\n- (government formation, includes, unification of regions through conquests)\n- (unification of regions through conquests, requires, capture of riyadh in 1902)\n- (saudi arabia, has_program, cultural dominance)\n- (cultural dominance, supports, wahhabi movement within sunni islam)\n- (wahhabi movement within sunni islam, uses, oil and gas trade for global spread)\n- (saudi arabia, has_program, area estimations)\n- (area estimations, includes, saudi government estimate of 2 217 949 sq km)\n- (area estimations, requires, other reputable variations between 2 149 690 and 2 240 000 sq km)\n- (saudi arabia, has_program, population distribution)\n- (population distribution, includes, varied among coastal areas interior oases and deserts in early 1990s)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Immediately prior to the Holocaust, the number of Jews in the world stood at approximately 16.7 million. Statistical figures vary for the contemporary demography of Ashkenazi Jews, oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million. Sergio DellaPergola in a rough calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, implies that Ashkenazi make up less than 74% of Jews worldwide. Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide. Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to World War II and the Holocaust). As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. In France, the immigration of Jews from Algeria (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim.

The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling, implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby. The series concerns the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) narrating the story of how he met the mother of his children. The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with a 27 - year - old Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect; the narrative deals primarily with his best friends, including the long - lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel) and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan); the eccentric, womanizing - playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris); and news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). The lives of all characters are entwined in each others.

Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,320 miles (3,730 km) to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth - longest and fifteenth - largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Minikahda Club is a golf club and course located in southwest Minneapolis, Minnesota, just west of Lake Calhoun. The course hosted the U.S. Open in 1916, the U.S. Amateur in 1927, and the Walker Cup in 1957. Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway.

By 1977, some radio stations, like New York's WTFM and NBC-owned WYNY, had switched to an all-soft rock format. By the 1980s, tastes had changed and radio formats reflected this change, including musical artists such as Journey. Walter Sabo and his team at NBC brought in major personalities from the AM Band to the FM Band taking the format from a background to a foreground listening experience. The addition of major radio stars such as Dan Daniel, Steve O'Brien, Dick Summers, Don Bleu and Tom Parker made it possible to fully monetize the format and provide the foundation for financial success enjoyed to this day Kelupis (which literally translates to 'glutinous rice rolls' in English) is a traditional kuih for the Bruneian Malay people in the country of Brunei and in the states of Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.

The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.

It is approximately long and flows through Sugarloaf Township, Benton Township, and Fishing Creek Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . Numerous bridges, both covered and non-covered, have been built over the creek. Its main tributary is East Branch Raven Creek. Other states with long histories of no death penalty include Wisconsin (the only state with only one execution), Rhode Island (although later reintroduced, it was unused and abolished again), Maine, North Dakota, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Vermont. The District of Columbia has also abolished the death penalty; it was last used in 1957. Oregon abolished the death penalty through an overwhelming majority in a 1964 public referendum but reinstated it in a 1984 joint death penalty/life imprisonment referendum by an even higher margin after a similar 1978 referendum succeeded but was not implemented due to judicial rulings. The Socialist Party of Oregon in Columbia County, Oregon began around the First Red Scare. The first year (1914) it went mainstream, the Socialist party had 27 more registered members than the Prohibition Party, who were some members of the Suffrage movement. The Socialist party was similar to the Progressive Party in the county, as it tried from the outskirts of government to make change. While Socialism failed its first year, it still received attention from the press who was aware of the October Revolution (1918) in Russia (Now the Soviet Union) by a similarly named government led by Vladimir Lenin.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (raven creek, supports, fishing creek)\n- (raven creek, includes, sugarloaf township)\n- (raven creek, includes, benton township)\n- (raven creek, includes, fishing creek township)\n- (east branch raven creek, supports, raven creek)\n- (raven creek, requires, numerous bridges)\n- (wisconsin, includes, no death penalty)\n- (wisconsin, requires, one execution)\n- (rhode island, abolishes, death penalty)\n- (rhode island, reintroduces, death penalty)\n- (maine, includes, no death penalty)\n- (north dakota, includes, no death penalty)\n- (minnesota, includes, no death penalty)\n- (west virginia, includes, no death penalty)\n- (iowa, includes, no death penalty)\n- (vermont, includes, no death penalty)\n- (the district of columbia, abolishes, death penalty)\n- (the district of columbia, requires, last execution in 1957)\n- (oregon, abolishes, death penalty)\n- (oregon, requires, public referendum in 1964)\n- (oregon, reinstates, death penalty)\n- (oregon, requires, referendum in 1984)\n- (the socialist party of oregon, begins, during first red scare)\n- (socialist party, requires, more members than prohibition party)\n- (socialist party, includes, 27 more members)\n- (socialist party, occurs, in 1914)\n- (suffrage movement, requires, members of prohibition party)\n- (socialist party, is similar to, progressive party)\n- (socialist party, tries for, change)\n- (socialism, receives, attention)\n- (october revolution (historical event, 1917), includes, vladimir lenin)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Phayap Army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern Burma, which was former Thai territory that had been annexed by Britain much earlier. Also involved were the Japanese puppet states of Manchukuo and Mengjiang (consisting of most of Manchuria and parts of Inner Mongolia respectively), and the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime (which controlled the coastal regions of China).

It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (usb, has_program, usb standardization program)\n- (usb standardization program, targets, computer peripherals)\n- (keyboard, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (pointing device, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (digital camera, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (printer, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (portable media player, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (disk drive, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (network adapter, is_example_of, computer peripherals)\n- (usb, has_program, usb common usage on smartphones program)\n- (usb common usage on smartphones program, targets, smartphones)\n- (usb, has_program, usb common usage on pdas program)\n- (usb common usage on pdas program, targets, pdas)\n- (usb, has_program, usb common usage on video game consoles program)\n- (usb common usage on video game consoles program, targets, video game consoles)\n- (usb, has_program, replacement of serial ports program)\n- (replacement of serial ports program, replaces, serial ports)\n- (usb, has_program, replacement of parallel ports program)\n- (replacement of parallel ports program, replaces, parallel ports)\n- (usb, has_program, replacement of power chargers for portable devices program)\n- (replacement of power chargers for portable devices program, replaces, separate power chargers)\n- (unit load definition, defines_in, usb 1 x and 2 0)\n- (unit load definition, defines_as, 100 ma)\n- (unit load definition, defines_in, usb 3 0)\n- (unit load definition, defines_as, 150 ma)\n- (device power draw, maximum_in, usb 1 x and 2 0)\n- (device power draw, is_maximum_of, five unit loads)\n- (device power draw, maximum_in, usb 3 0)\n- (device power draw, is_maximum_of, six unit loads)\n- (device types, includes, low power device)\n- (device types, includes, high power device)\n- (low power device, draws_at_most, one unit load)\n- (minimum operating voltage for low power devices, in_usb_2_0, 4.4 v)\n- (minimum operating voltage for low power devices, in_usb_3_0, 4 v)\n- (device enumeration phases, functions_initially_as, low power device)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Ban Kenpha is a village in Houaphanh Province, northeastern Laos. It is to the northeast of Vieng Kham, not far from Muang Xon. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the portuguese, has_discovery, cape of good hope discovery)\n- (cape of good hope discovery, allows_avoidance_of, ottoman trade monopoly)\n- (ottoman empire, engages_in, naval wars with portuguese)\n- (naval wars with portuguese, impact_on_maritime_trade_routes, indian ocean maritime routes)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, allies_with, ottomans)\n- (alliance between ajuran and ottomans, defiance_of_portuguese_monopoly_through, new coinage following ottoman pattern)\n- (ban kenpha, is_located_northeast_of, vieng kham)\n- (vieng kham, near_to, muang xon in houaphanh province northeastern laos)\n- (toungoo dynasty, regroups_and_defeats, portuguese in 1613)\n- (defeat of portuguese (1613), followed_by_defeat_of, siam in 1614)\n- (restored toungoo kings, creates_legal_and_political_framework, for myanmar governance)\n- (legal and political framework creation, continues_into, long-term impact on myanmar governance)\n- (crown, reduces_hereditary_rights_of, shan chiefs)\n- (reduction of hereditary rights, leads_to_appointment_of, governorships in irrawaddy valley)\n- (kingdom, builds_trade_and_administrative_reforms, for prosperity period)\n- (economic reforms, results_in_prosperity_period_for, more than 80 years)\n- (kingdom, faces_repeated_meithei_raids_into_upper_myanmar_and_rebellion_in_lan_na_from, the 1720s onward)\n- (founders of restored hanthawaddy kingdom (1740), sack_ava_and_end_toungoo_dynasty, in 1752)\n- (myanmar, borders_with_countries, china india bangladesh thailand laos)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His father worked in the government of Samanid in the village Kharmasain, a Sunni regional power. After five years, his younger brother, Mahmoud, was born. Avicenna first began to learn the Quran and literature in such a way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them. Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries.

Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.

Many aspects of her life and work remain very unclear, especially outside the period 1607 to 1621 from which period dated paintings are known. As Seymour Slive puts it \"Not a single uncontested document has surfaced about her life but there is reason to believe she was active in both Flanders and Holland.\" After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Ce\u0301vennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Loze\u0300re. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200\u20132800 BC.

Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, southwest asia program)\n- (southwest asia program, includes, situated in southwest asia)\n- (situated in southwest asia, borders_body_of_water, persian gulf and red sea)\n- (persian gulf and red sea, is_north_of, yemen)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, arabian peninsula occupation program)\n- (arabian peninsula occupation program, occupies_percentage, 80 percent of arabian peninsula)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, undefined boundaries program)\n- (undefined boundaries program, borders_with_countries, most of saudi arabia borders uae oman and yemen are undefined)\n- (al saud, has_program, emergence as minor rulers in najd program)\n- (emergence as minor rulers in najd program, occurred_in_region, central arabia)\n- (al saud, has_program, expansionist policy with wahhabi islam program)\n- (abdulaziz, has_program, wars of conquest program)\n- (wars of conquest program, occurred_between_years, 1902 and 1927)\n- (abdulaziz, has_program, establishment of kingdom of saudi arabia program)\n- (establisment of kingdom of saudi arabia program, established_in_year, 1930)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, area estimation program)\n- (area estimation program, government_estimate, 2 217 949 square kilometres)\n- (area estimation program, reputable_estimates, varies between 2 149 690 and 2 240 000 sq km)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, population distribution program)\n- (population distribution program, varied_greatly_among_regions, coastal areas interior oases and deserts in the early 1990s)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Muang Kasi is a river town in Vientiane Province, Laos. It is located to the north of Ban Thieng along Route 13. The Pathet Lao were active in Muang Kasi. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (myanmar, lies_along, indian plate)\n- (myanmar, is_to_the_west_of, bay of bengal)\n- (myanmar, is_to_the_south_of, andaman sea)\n- (myanmar, is_strategically_located_near, indian ocean shipping lanes)\n- (ottoman empire, has_trade_monopoly, indian ocean)\n- (western european states, discovered_routes, new maritime trade routes)\n- (western european states, avoid, ottoman trade monopoly)\n- (portuguese, discovered, cape of good hope 1488)\n- (ottoman empire, naval_wars_with, portuguese in indian ocean)\n- (ajuran empire, employed_coinage_following_pattern, ottoman)\n- (muang kasi, is_river_town_in, vientiane province laos)\n- (ban thieng, located_to_the_north_of, muang kasi along route 13)\n- (pathet lao, were_active_in, muang kasi)\n- (dynasty, also_defeated_siam_in, 1614)\n- (restored toungoo kings, restored_smaller_kingdom_encompassing, lower myanmar upper myanmar shan states lan na upper tenasserim)\n- (restored toungoo kings, created_legal_and_political_framework_continuing_into_19th_century, legal and political framework)\n- (shan chiefs, hereditary_rights_greatly_reduced, shan chiefs)\n- (kingdom, faced_meithei_raids_into_upper_myanmar_from_the_1720s_onward, meithei)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The term is used in Scholasticism for a \"renowned scholar\", and in biological taxonomy for the scientist describing a species or other taxon. The term is widely replaced by author in English-language works. Charlemagne's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the \"Carolingian Renaissance\". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin. The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a \"German\" ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the Saxons, Franci, Thuringii, Alamanni and Bavarii.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (charlemagne, initiated, carolingian renaissance)\n- (carolingian renaissance, involved, alcuin)\n- (alcuin, invited_by, charlemagne)\n- (alcuin, brought_education_to, aachen)\n- (aachen, enhanced_liturgical_and_scriptural_studies, carolingian renaissance)\n- (charlemagne, used_carolingian_minuscule_in_chancery, carolingian minuscule)\n- (carolingian minuscule, allowed_common_writing_style_across_europe, communication advancement)\n- (charlemagne, sponsored_changes_in_liturgy, gregorian chant)\n- (gregorian chant, introduced_by_charlemagne_sponsorship, liturgical music)\n- (scholars, copied_corrected_and_disseminated_works_on_topics, religious and secular topics)\n- (scholars, aimed_to_encourage_learning_through_dissemination, dissemination)\n- (carolingian renaissance, produced_new_works_on_religious_topics, scholars)\n- (carolingian renaissance, produced_schoolbooks, schoolbooks)\n- (latin language, modified_by_grammarians_during_period, classical latin divergence)\n- (classical latin, diverged_into_medieval_latin_for_church_and_government_needs, medieval latin)\n- (german ethnicity, coalesced_from_various_groups, saxons franci thuringii alamanni bavarii)\n- (carolingian renaissance, increased_literacy, literacy increase)\n- (carolingian renaissance, developed_arts, arts development)\n- (carolingian renaissance, advanced_architecture, architecture advancement)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In 1968, Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubc\u030cek to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubc\u030cek needed help in facing down the Soviets. In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia. Prague underground was an underground culture developed in Prague, Czechoslovakia in the late 1960s and 1970s during the Normalization period. The movement was characterized by resistance against conformity, conventions, and consumerism. Because of its non-conformity, it had serious problems with the communist regime which considered it as a political opposition. Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President.

He claims that the term \"operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues\" and that it creates a \"bias\" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to \"property rights\". Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. Defective by Design is an anti-DRM initiative by the Free Software Foundation. DRM technology, known as \"digital rights management\" technology by its supporters, restricts users' ability to freely use their purchased movies, music, literature, software, and hardware in ways they are accustomed to with ordinary non-restricted media (such as books and audio compact discs).

Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as al-Tusi) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as al-Razi) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as al-Ghazali) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means.

The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed. Following shooting of the film, there was a clear flat area at one end of the beach that was created artificially with an odd layout of trees which was never rectified, and the entire area remained damaged from the original state until the tsunami of 2004.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (trotsky, believes_in, world revolution)\n- (world revolution, aligns_with, imperialism theory)\n- (imperialism theory, written_by, lenin)\n- (joseph stalin, establishes_after_death_of_lenin, socialism in one country policy)\n- (socialism in one country policy, purges, internationalist elements)\n- (internationalist elements, creates_model_for, inward-looking states)\n- (internationalist tendencies, abandoned_during, cold war period)\n- (cold war period, returns_as, client states competing with americans)\n- (client states, put_pressure_on_by, nikita khrushchev)\n- (nikita khrushchev, starts_wave_of, anti-imperialist propaganda in late 1950s)\n- (soviet union, declares_itself, anti-imperialist)\n- (anti-imperialist declaration, argued_by_critics_to_exhibit, imperial tendencies)\n- (imperial tendencies, viewed_as_hybrid_entity_with_elements_of, multinational empires and nation states)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony.

Most of her work stands out by being made with her own blood and hair. John Cabot (Italian: Giovanni Caboto; c. 1450 -- c. 1500) was a Venetian navigator and explorer whose 1497 discovery of the coast of North America under the commission of Henry VII of England was the first European exploration of coastal North America since the Norse visits to Vinland in the eleventh century. To mark the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Cabot's expedition, both the Canadian and British governments elected Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland, as representing Cabot's first landing site. However, alternative locations have also been proposed. Sebastian Cabot (Italian and , ; , \"Gaboto\" or \"Cabot\"; 1474 \u2013 December 1557) was an Italian explorer, likely born in the Venetian Republic.

The New York Red Bulls play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pele\u0301, one of the world's most famous soccer players. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations in subsequent years. New York City is home to the headquarters of the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer.

Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa: During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

MCA Records was an American record label owned by MCA Inc., which later gave way to the larger MCA Music Entertainment Group (now Universal Music Group), which the label was part of until its dissolution in 2003. The label's country division MCA Nashville is a still active imprint of Universal Music Group Nashville. MCA Records picked up the reissue rights for \"Con-Test\", as well as Nash's \"American Band-ages\" in 1986, but the abrupt change in record labels led to a near-absence of promotion for both records. Santa Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people. Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portola\u0300, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4.

Throughout this decade, artists such as Nick Lachey, James Blunt, John Mayer, Bruno Mars, Jason Mraz, Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Clay Aiken and Susan Boyle have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound. Much as some hot AC and modern rock artists have crossed over into each other, so too has soft AC crossed with country music in this decade. Country musicians such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes and Carrie Underwood have had success on both charts.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (illuminations album, has_album_number, fifth studio album)\n- (fifth studio album, by_artist, josh groban)\n- (illuminations album, produced_by, rick rubin)\n- (voce\u0302 existe em mim, is_song_of, illuminations album)\n- (voce\u0302 existe em mim, written_by, lester mendez)\n- (voce\u0302 existe em mim, written_by, carlinhos brown)\n- (illuminations album, released_on, november 15, 2010)\n- (michael buble\u0301, started_as_artist_in, soft ac music)\n- (soft ac music, has_sound_type, ballad-heavy sound)\n- (michael buble\u0301, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (josh groban, started_as_artist_in, soft ac music)\n- (josh groban, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (nick lachey, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (john mayer, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (bruno mars, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (jason mraz, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (kelly clarkson, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (adele, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (clay aiken, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (susan boyle, had_success_in, ballad-heavy sound of this decade)\n- (soft ac music, has_crossed_with, country music)\n- (faith hill, had_success_on, soft ac charts)\n- (faith hill, had_success_on, country charts)\n- (shania twain, had_success_on, soft ac charts)\n- (shania twain, had_success_on, country charts)\n- (leann rimes, had_success_on, soft ac charts)\n- (leann rimes, had_success_on, country charts)\n- (carrie underwood, had_success_on, soft ac charts)\n- (carrie underwood, had_success_on, country charts)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. Subsequently with the disgrace of \"Near East\" in diplomatic and military circles, \"Middle East\" prevailed.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (southwest asia program, includes, situated in sw asia fact)\n- (situated in sw asia fact, targets, southwest asia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, persian gulf and red sea borders program)\n- (persian gulf and red sea borders program, includes, borders persian gulf fact)\n- (borders persian gulf fact, targets, persian gulf)\n- (persian gulf and red sea borders program, includes, borders red sea fact)\n- (borders red sea fact, targets, red sea)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, north of yemen program)\n- (north of yemen program, includes, north of yemen fact)\n- (north of yemen fact, targets, yemen)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, shipping leverage program)\n- (shipping leverage program, includes, persian gulf shipping fact)\n- (persian gulf shipping fact, targets, persian gulf)\n- (shipping leverage program, includes, suez canal significance fact)\n- (suez canal significance fact, targets, suez canal)\n- (shipping leverage program, includes, crude oil transportation fact)\n- (crude oil transportation fact, targets, crude oil)\n- (al saud, has_program, minor tribal rulers in najd program)\n- (minor tribal rulers in najd program, includes, emerged as minor tribal rulers fact)\n- (emerged as minor tribal rulers fact, targets, najd)\n- (minor tribal rulers in najd program, has_time_period, mid 18th century)\n- (al saud, has_program, expansionist with wahhabi zeal program)\n- (expansionist with wahhabi zeal program, includes, became aggressively expansionist fact)\n- (became aggressively expansionist fact, targets, wahhabi islamic zeal)\n- (expansionist with wahhabi zeal program, has_time_period, mid 18th century)\n- (wars of conquest program, includes, carried out wars fact)\n- (carried out wars fact, targets, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (wars of conquest program, has_time_period, 1902 to 1927)\n- (abdulaziz, has_program, establishment of kingdom program)\n- (establishment of kingdom program, includes, established kingdom fact)\n- (established kingdom fact, targets, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (establishment of kingdom program, has_time_period, 1930)\n- (government of saudi arabia, has_program, size estimation program)\n- (size estimation program, has_amount, 2 217 949 square km)\n- (size estimation program, targets, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (other reputable estimates, has_program, varying size estimates program)\n- (varying size estimates program, includes, lower bound fact)\n- (lower bound fact, has_amount, 2 149 690 sq km)\n- (varying size estimates program, includes, upper bound fact)\n- (upper bound fact, has_amount, 2 240 000 sq km)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, cultivation suitability program)\n- (cultivation suitability program, has_percentage, less than one percent)\n- (cultivation suitability program, targets, total area)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

However, \"Near East\" continues in some circles at the discretion of the defining agency or academic department. They are not generally considered distinct regions as they were at their original definition. Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.Shiraz's economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice. Industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork and rugs dominate.

His most noted work was a statue of Tyche, which he made for the city of Antioch, then newly founded. The goddess, who embodied the idea of the city, was seated on a rock, crowned with towers, and having the river Orontes at her feet. There is a small copy of the statue in the Vatican. It was imitated by a number of Asiatic cities; and indeed most statues since created that commemorate cities borrow something from the work of Eutychides. In Greek mythology, Sicyon (; ) is the eponym of the polis of the same name, which was said to have previously been known as Aegiale and, earlier, Mecone. His father is named variously as Marathon, Metion, Erechtheus or Pelops.

Connecting the sestieri (districts) of San Marco and San Polo, it has been rebuilt several times since its first construction as a pontoon bridge in the 12th century, and is now a significant tourist attraction in the city. La fida ninfa (\"The Faithful Nymph\") is an opera by Antonio Vivaldi to a libretto by Scipione Maffei. The opera was first performed for the opening of the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona on 6 January 1732. Among the arias is \"Alma oppressa de sorte crudele\" (\"Soul oppressed by cruel fate\"). Orlando furioso RV 819 (, Teatro San Angelo, Venice 1714) is a three-act opera surviving in manuscript in Antonio Vivaldi's personal library, only partly related to his better known Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727. It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84.

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435\u20131449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court. Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa: As a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Sainty, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center.

It is part of the City University of New York. Ernest Glenn McClain (August 6, 1918 Massillon, Ohio - April 25, 2014 Washington, DC) was professor emeritus of music at Brooklyn College. McClain is known for his efforts to establish the ancient mathematical discipline of music as the means to unlock the deepest meaning of history's great religious and philosophical texts. His writings offer a musical-mathematical explanation of crucial passages in texts of world literature, including the Bible, the Rig Veda, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and Plato. All of these passages deal with numbers that he claimed had either been ignored or misinterpreted throughout the centuries. McClain's explanation is based on the meanings of these numbers within the context of the quadrivium, the four ancient mathematical disciplines of arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. His discovery of identical or similar numbers and parallel mathematical constructs in Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, Palestine and Greece, suggests the historical continuity of a common spiritual tradition linking the microcosm of the soul to the macrocosm of the universe. His work provides much of the missing mathematical detail for what scholars often call the Music of the Spheres.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, is-born-on, august 6, 1918)\n- (august 6, 1918, occurs-in, massillon, ohio)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, is-died-on, april 25, 2014)\n- (april 25, 2014, occurs-in, washington, dc)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, is-position-of, professor emeritus of music)\n- (professor emeritus of music, is-at, brooklyn college)\n- (brooklyn college, is-type-of, public college)\n- (public college, located-in, brooklyn, new york city)\n- (brooklyn college, is-part-of, cuny)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, contributes-to, music of the spheres)\n- (music of the spheres, includes, mathematical detail)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, writes-about, crucial passages)\n- (crucial passages, are-in, world literature)\n- (world literature, includes, musical-mathematical explanation)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, claims-about, numbers)\n- (numbers, are-ignored-in, centuries)\n- (numbers, are-misinterpreted-in, centuries)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, makes-discovery-of, historical continuity)\n- (historical continuity, includes, common spiritual tradition)\n- (common spiritual tradition, links-microcosm-to-macrocosm-in, universe)\n- (universe, is-in, sumer; egypt; babylon; palestine; greece)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, explains-with, numbers)\n- (numbers, are-in-context-of, quadrivium)\n- (quadrivium, includes, arithmetic; music; geometry; astronomy)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics.

He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, has_view, christocentric theology)\n- (luther, reveres, mary)\n- (luther, criticizes, papists)\n- (papists, blur, line between high admiration of god's grace and religious service given to another creature)\n- (luther, considers, roman catholic practices)\n- (roman catholic practices, include, celebrating saints' days)\n- (roman catholic practices, include, making intercessory requests addressed to mary and other departed saints)\n- (celebrating saints' days, considered by luther, idolatry)\n- (making intercessory requests addressed to mary and other departed saints, considered by luther, idolatry)\n- (luther, preaches, sermon)\n- (sermon, location, wittenberg)\n- (sermon, time, one month before luther's death)\n- (sermon, topic, marian devotion and veneration)\n- (martin luther, starts, protestant reformation)\n- (protestant reformation, initiated by, ninety-five theses)\n- (luther, criticizes, sale of indulgences)\n- (luther, insists, pope has no authority over purgatory)\n- (catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints, lacks foundation in, bible)\n- (luther, believes, catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints lacks foundation in the bible)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporates, doctrinal changes)\n- (doctrinal changes, include, sola scriptura)\n- (protestant reformation, includes, belief in sola fide)\n- (core motivation, is, theological)\n- (many factors, include, rise of nationalism)\n- (perceived corruption, contributes to, reformation)\n- (humanism and the new learning of the renaissance, questions, traditional thought)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

As for its predecessor, it has a ladder frame with leaf sprung front and rear axles. The Toyopet Master was an evolution of an earlier Toyota sedan called the Toyota SF/RH model (also known as the Super), and was sold in parallel with the first Toyota Crown. The more conservative Master was introduced as a frugally equipped version meant for taxi usage. The Master and Crown shared the same R-series engine, which produces in the Master. It was sold at a chain of Toyota Japan dealerships called \"Toyota Store\", next to the more upscale Crown, which was intended as a private purchase alternative to the Master. The Acura Legend is a mid-size luxury/executive car manufactured by Honda. It was sold in the U.S., Canada, and parts of China under Honda's luxury brand, Acura, from 1985 to 1995, as both a sedan, which was classified as a full-size car, and a coupe, which was classified as a mid-size car (similar to how the Honda Accord is set up today). It was the first flagship sedan sold under the Acura nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the Acura 3.5RL. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (toyopet master, has_introduction_date, january 1955)\n- (january 1955, introduces_vehicle, toyopet master)\n- (toyopet master, is_evolution_of, sf/rh model)\n- (sf/rh model, also_known_as, super)\n- (toyopet master, uses_engine_type, r-series engine)\n- (toyota crown, uses_engine_type, r-series engine)\n- (toyopet master, sold_at_dealerships, toyota store)\n- (toyota store, sells_vehicle, toyopet master)\n- (toyopet master, parallel_sold_with, toyota crown)\n- (toyota crown, is_alternative_to, toyopet master)\n- (acura legend, manufactured_by, honda)\n- (honda, manufactures_acura_legend_in_us_and_canada_from_1985_to_1995, acura legend)\n- (acura legend, available_as_sedan_and_coupe, sedan and coupe classification)\n- (acura legend, is_flagship_sedan_under_acura_nameplate, first flagship sedan)\n- (acura legend, renamed_in_1996, acura 3.5rl)\n- (acura 3.5rl, is_north_american_version_of, ka9 series honda legend)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, introduced_to_increase_passenger_space_and_amenities_without_price_increase, larger cars introduced by toyota)\n- (toyota cressida, introduced_to_increase_passenger_space_and_amenities_without_price_increase, larger cars introduced by toyota)\n- (mazda 616, introduced_to_increase_passenger_space_and_amenities_without_price_increase, larger cars introduced by toyota)\n- (datsun 810, introduced_to_increase_passenger_space_and_amenities_without_price_increase, larger cars introduced by toyota)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (\u738b\u6f6e) and Wang Shenzhi (\u738b\u5be9\u77e5), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect. The Manchus sent Han Bannermen to fight against Koxinga's Ming loyalists in Fujian. The Qing carried out a massive depopulation policy and seaban forcing people to evacuated the coast in order to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources, this has led to a myth that it was because Manchus were \"afraid of water\". In Fujian, it was Han Bannermen who were the ones carrying out the fighting and killing for the Qing and this disproved the entirely irrelevant claim that alleged fear of the water on part of the Manchus had to do with the coastal evacuation and seaban. Even though a poem refers to the soldiers carrying out massacres in Fujian as \"barbarian\", both Han Green Standard Army and Han Bannermen were involved in the fighting for the Qing side and carried out the worst slaughter. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (chen zheng, has_program, 677 ad program)\n- (677 ad program, targets, fujian region)\n- (677 ad program, includes, chen yuanguang)\n- (677 ad program, uses, middle chinese phonology of northern china during the 7th century)\n- (wang chao and wang shenzhi, has_program, 885 ad program)\n- (885 ad program, targets, huang chao rebellion)\n- (885 ad program, uses, northern middle chinese language)\n- (northern middle chinese language, has_migration_wave, first wave)\n- (first wave, brings_to, fujian region)\n- (fujian region, evolves_into, zhangzhou dialect)\n- (two waves of migrations from the north, includes, second wave)\n- (second wave, brings_to, fujian region)\n- (manchus, sends_force, han bannermen)\n- (han bannermen, fights_against, koxinga's ming loyalists)\n- (koxinga's ming loyalists, conflict_involves, qing dynasty period)\n- (qing dynasty, carries_out_policy, depopulation policy)\n- (depopulation policy, includes, seaban (forced evacuation of the coast))\n- (han green standard army and han bannermen, fights_for, qing side)\n- (400,000 green standard army soldiers and 200,000 bannermen, used_against, three feudatories)\n- (qing dynasty period, involves, depopulation policy)\n- (qing dynasty period, involves, seaban)\n- (chen zheng and chen yuanguang, brings_phonology_to, zhangzhou)\n- (middle chinese phonology of northern china during the 7th century, evolves_into, zhangzhou dialect)\n- (wang chao and wang shenzhi, brings_phonology_to, zhangzhou)\n- (northern middle chinese language, evolves_into, zhangzhou dialect)\n- (han green standard army and han bannermen, carries_out_slaughter_in, fujian region)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It was shot in black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; \"Suga Mama\" was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to \"slowly become a woman\" during the video, adding \"Well, a sexier woman \u2013 I'm always a woman.\"Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00 am that they completed work. The recorded history of Austin, Texas, began in the 1830s when Anglo - American settlers arrived in Central Texas. In 1837 settlers founded the village of Waterloo on the banks of the Colorado River, the first permanent settlement in the area.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (suga mama, has_video, suga mama video)\n- (suga mama video, was_released_in, april 2007)\n- (b'day anthology video album, includes, suga mama video)\n- (b'day anthology video album, has_videos, eight videos)\n- (eight videos, were_shot_in, two weeks)\n- (melina matsoukas, co_directed_video_with, knowles)\n- (knowles, sits_on, chair)\n- (chair, is_worn_by, men's clothing)\n- (men's clothing, includes, cigar)\n- (knowles, performs_pole_dance_in, video)\n- (pole dance, uses, two ballet bars)\n- (two ballet bars, are_used_for, pole dance rehearsal)\n- (knowles, dances_on_top_of, sugar cube)\n- (sugar cube, is_part_of, video scene)\n- (backing dancers, have_faces_concealed_in, video)\n- (circle of light, knowles_lies_in, video scene)\n- (mechanical bull, knowles_ride, video scene)\n- (knowles, falls_off, mechanical bull)\n- (mechanical bull, is_operated_by, man)\n- (man, programs_faster_than_expected, mechanical bull)\n- (video scene, was_shot_at, twelve frames per second)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The song shows the band's new sound, the sound of the song is hard rock instead of their previous nu metal sound. The song also features no rapping at all, something that was used in Papa Roach's previous singles.

His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: John Kodwo Amissah (November 27, 1922 \u2013 September 22, 1991) was a Ghanaian prelate of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Cape Coast from 1959 until his death. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.

The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. Xexyz (pronounced zeks'-zees/zeks'-iz), known in Japan as , is a 1988 video game published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released in Japan on August 26, 1988, and saw a North American release sometime in April, 1990. The game was never released in Europe and the game is not playable on PAL consoles. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?)

The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel (with a faculty of medicine) and has a tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. The biggest university in Switzerland is the University of Zurich with nearly 25,000 students. The two institutes sponsored by the federal government are the ETHZ in Zu\u0308rich (founded 1855) and the EPFL in Lausanne (founded 1969 as such, formerly an institute associated with the University of Lausanne) which both have an excellent international reputation.[note 10] Andre\u0301 S. Dreiding (22 June 1919 in Zu\u0308rich \u2013 24 December 2013 in Herrliberg near Zurich) was a Swiss chemist. He finished his high school studies in Zu\u0308rich and then studied at Columbia University in New York where he was awarded BS and MS degrees. After two years as research assistant at Hoffmann-La Roche, he continued postgraduate studies at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under professor Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1947. He remained at the university until 1949 as Rackham and Lloyd Postdoctoral Fellow. From 1949 to 1954, Dreiding was assistant professor at Wayne University, Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. He also temporarily took over Bachmann's teaching and research duties at the University of Michigan after Bachmann's death in 1951, and held them until 1952. In 1954, Dreiding turned to Switzerland and University of Zurich, where he became professor, and stayed until his retirement in 1987, after which he has been emeritus professor.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (university of basel, has_program, founding program)\n- (founding program, has_year, 1460)\n- (founding program, has_location, basel)\n- (university of basel, includes, faculty of medicine)\n- (university of basel, tradition_in, chemical and medical research)\n- (the biggest university in switzerland, is, university of zurich)\n- (ethz, has_program, founding program)\n- (founding program, has_year, 1855)\n- (founding program, has_location, zu\u0308rich)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, completed_education_at, high school zu\u0308rich)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, received_degree_from, columbia university bs ms degrees)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, worked_as, research assistant)\n- (research assistant, at_institution, hoffmann-la roche)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, studied_postgraduate_at, university of michigan)\n- (study program, under_professor, werner emmanuel bachmann)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, received_degree_from, university of michigan phd 1947)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, was_fellowship_holding, rackham and lloyd postdoctoral fellow)\n- (fellowship period, until_year, 1949)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, became_professor_at, wayne university detroit institute of cancer research)\n- (professorship start, in_year, 1949)\n- (werner emmanuel bachmann, died_in, 1951)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, took_over_duties_of, werner emmanuel bachmann duties)\n- (duties period, until_year, 1952)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, became_professor_at, university of zurich 1954)\n- (professorship start, in_year, 1954)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, stayed_as_professor_until, retirement 1987)\n- (andre\u0301 s. dreiding, has_status_of, emeritus professor)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

This directory documented Reformed worship practices and theology adopted and developed over the preceding century by British Puritans, initially guided by John Calvin and John Knox. It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere. The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers \u2013 the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote. Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side.
