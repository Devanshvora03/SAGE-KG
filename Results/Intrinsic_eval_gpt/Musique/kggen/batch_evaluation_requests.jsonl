He wrote fundamental works in applied celestial mechanics, spaceflight dynamics and robotics. On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (mao zedong, reported to, politburo)\n- (china, justified entry into the war as a response to, american aggression)\n- (people's liberation army, reorganized into, pla north east frontier force)\n- (nikita khrushchev, started, anti-imperialist propaganda)\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, wrote, applied celestial mechanics)\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, wrote, robotics)\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, wrote, spaceflight dynamics)\n- (nikita khrushchev, put pressure on, soviet-american relations)\n- (mao zedong, would intervene in, korea)\n- (united states seventh fleet, to prevent hostilities between, nationalist republic of china)\n- (revolution, could succeed in, russia)\n- (joseph stalin, established, socialism in one country)\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, pioneer of, space ballistics)\n- (joseph stalin, purged, internationalist elements)\n- (united states seventh fleet, to prevent hostilities between, people's republic of china)\n- (joseph stalin, created, stalinist states)\n- (united states seventh fleet, to, taiwan strait)\n- (lenin, wrote extensively on, imperialism)\n- (president truman, dispatched, united states seventh fleet)\n- (trotsky, believed in, world revolution)\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, was, aerospace engineer)\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, was, scientist)\n- (lenin, declared, imperialism)\n- (china, justified entry into the war as a response to, un)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade.

John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.

This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado, released The BCCI Affair, a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with terrorists, including Abu Nidal. It blasted the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, the Customs Service, the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as influential lobbyists and the CIA. The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama.

Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia, but, failing to win a single state other than South Carolina, chose to withdraw from the presidential race. Sharpton followed suit a couple weeks later. Kuninch did not leave the race officially until July. In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.

He made significant career progress through the court of King Vajiravudh, but left government office to work privately as the country was going through political change which abolished absolute monarchy and decreased government employment of foreigners. However, by adopting a Thai identity and way of life, marrying a Thai woman and settling down permanently, Manfredi remained a relevant and respected figure in Thai architecture, and later became a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University. His works include various royal residences and public institutions, ranging in style from Venetian Gothic to modernist, and incorporated Thai traditional styles as well. He contributed to much of Bangkok's architectural heritage, but no complete records of his works were kept.

The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. In 1963 Flexer moved to Canada settling in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he became involved in the anti-war movement protesting the Vietnam War and participated in the celebrated removal of Dow Chemical from the U of M campus. In 1968 he moved to Montreal. Following a brief stay in Israel in 1970, where he lived and worked on kibbutz Gan-Shmuel, he moved back to Canada and settled in Toronto in 1970. There he joined the Waffle, a radical socialist tendency within the New Democratic Party, becoming its provincial organizer in Ontario. Moving leftward, he helped form the Red Circle, a Marxist tendency within the Waffle. When the Waffle was forced out of the NDP in 1972, Flexer and the Red Circle split with the Waffle, opposing its decision to leave the NDP, and tried to continue Marxist activities within the NDP. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, occupies, arabian peninsula)\n- (abdulaziz, established, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (flexer, opposed decision to leave, ndp)\n- (flexer, helped form, red circle)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, situated in, southwest asia)\n- (flexer, lived and worked on, kibbutz gan-shmuel)\n- (flexer, settled in, toronto)\n- (flexer, settled in, winnipeg)\n- (waffle, forced out of, ndp)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, largest country of, arabia)\n- (red circle, within, waffle)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, north of, yemen)\n- (al saud, imbued with, wahhabi islamic movement)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, coastlines on, persian gulf)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, bordering, persian gulf)\n- (flexer, protested, vietnam war)\n- (flexer, joined, waffle)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, shipping through, suez canal)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, coastlines on, red sea)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, bordering, red sea)\n- (flexer, moved to, canada)\n- (flexer, moved to, montreal)\n- (waffle, within, new democratic party)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

(also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Sunman is an unreleased action video game developed by EIM and planned to be published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system\u2014the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's \"Ultra Games\" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (nintendo entertainment system, was succeeded by, super nintendo entertainment system)\n- (nintendo, maintained exclusive control over titles released for, nintendo entertainment system)\n- (capcom, licensed some games to, sega)\n- (square, was a notable holdout from releasing games for, sega)\n- (hyundai comboy, was distributed by, sk hynix)\n- (sk hynix, was known as, hyundai electronics)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, faced competition from, sega)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, was initially released in japan as, family computer)\n- (family computer, is also known as, famicom)\n- (family computer, is abbreviated as, fc)\n- (sunman, was developed by, eim)\n- (konami, used the brand, ultra games)\n- (acclaim, began releasing games for, nintendo entertainment system)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, is abbreviated as, nes)\n- (nintendo entertainment system, was developed and manufactured by, nintendo)\n- (acclaim, began releasing games for, sega)\n- (sunman, was planned to be published by, sunsoft)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (meithei, raided, upper myanmar)\n- (myanmar, borders, laos)\n- (toungoo dynasty, encompassed, tenasserim)\n- (toungoo dynasty, encompassed, lan na)\n- (myanmar, borders, bangladesh)\n- (hanthawaddy kingdom, sacked, ava)\n- (ottoman-portuguese naval wars, occurred in, indian ocean)\n- (khong island, is located in, khong district)\n- (toungoo dynasty, encompassed, upper myanmar)\n- (myanmar, is located near, indian ocean)\n- (myanmar, is located to the south of, andaman sea)\n- (ottoman-portuguese naval wars, occurred in, 16th century)\n- (khong island, is located in, champasak province)\n- (portuguese, were defeated by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (siam, were defeated by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (myanmar, is also known as, burma)\n- (myanmar, borders, thailand)\n- (myanmar, is located to the west of, bay of bengal)\n- (myanmar, lies along, indian plates)\n- (khong island, is the largest island in, si phan don)\n- (myanmar, is located to the southeast of, himalayas)\n- (khong island, is located in, mekong river)\n- (toungoo dynasty, encompassed, lower myanmar)\n- (myanmar, lies along, eurasian plates)\n- (khong island, is located in, laos)\n- (toungoo dynasty, reduced hereditary rights of, shan chiefs)\n- (myanmar, borders, india)\n- (toungoo dynasty, encompassed, shan states)\n- (meithei, raided, lan na)\n- (myanmar, borders, china)\n- (toungoo dynasty, replaced hereditary chieftainships in, irrawaddy valley)\n- (cape of good hope, was discovered by, portuguese)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States. Roosevelt had served as president from 1901 to 1909, and Taft had won the 1908 Republican president nomination with Roosevelt's support. Displeased with Taft's actions as president, Roosevelt challenged Taft at the 1912 Republican National Convention. After Taft and his conservative allies narrowly prevailed at the Republican convention, Roosevelt rallied his progressive supporters and launched a third party bid. With the support of William Jennings Bryan and other progressives, Wilson won the Democratic Party's presidential nomination on the 46th ballot.

The bridge opened in 1967 and was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. It had a catastrophic failure during the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely cause of the collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and additional weight on the bridge at the time contributed to the catastrophic failure. Minneapolis is a city in and the county seat of Ottawa County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,032.

Some, such as the United Kingdom and Prussia (as the founder of the newly formed German state), experienced continued economic growth and political power. Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated. At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of industrialization. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: Italy after the Risorgimento, Japan after the Meiji Restoration, and the United States after its civil war. By the dawn of the 20th century, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna. The Eight-Nation Alliance was a belligerent alliance of eight nations against the Boxer Rebellion in China. It formed in 1900 and consisted of the five Congress powers plus Italy, Japan, and the United States, representing the great powers at the beginning of 20th century. The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the Belle E\u0301poque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (eight-nation alliance, consisted of, italy)\n- (eight-nation alliance, against, china)\n- (prussia, founder of, german state)\n- (united states, after, civil war)\n- (jungfraubahn, terminating at, jungfraujoch)\n- (eight-nation alliance, against, boxer rebellion)\n- (eight-nation alliance, consisted of, japan)\n- (eight-nation alliance, consisted of, united states)\n- (japan, after, meiji restoration)\n- (italy, after, risorgimento)\n- (jungfraubahn, going through, eiger)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth. Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, Heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention -- possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (sun, has higher proportion of, oxygen-16)\n- (sun, compared to, earth)\n- (heliocentrism, revolve around, sun)\n- (planetary geologists, measured, oxygen isotopes)\n- (sun's disk of protoplanetary material, depleted, oxygen-16)\n- (planetary geologists, measured, meteorites)\n- (planetary geologists, measured, mars)\n- (heliocentrism, opposed, geocentrism)\n- (aristarchus of samos, proposed, heliocentrism)\n- (planetary geologists, measured, earth)\n- (silicon wafer, exposed to, solar wind)\n- (silicon wafer, returned by, genesis spacecraft)\n- (planetary geologists, measured, moon)\n- (dust grains, formed, earth)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.Shiraz's economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice.

Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities. Despite cost of living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities. The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the United States at that time, providing services denied to them by the existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, founded, bank of italy)\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, raised by, lorenzo scatena)\n- (bank of italy, located in, san francisco)\n- (1906 san francisco earthquake, affected, san francisco)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women \"into the mainstream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men.\"\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the feminine mystique, published on, february 19, 1963)\n- (the feminine mystique, published by, w.w. norton)\n- (betty friedan, died on, february 4, 2006)\n- (betty friedan, was a, american feminist writer)\n- (the feminine mystique, credited with sparking, second-wave feminism)\n- (betty friedan, elected first president of, now)\n- (real median level, was, 2016)\n- (national organization for women, founded in, 1966)\n- (the feminine mystique, written by, betty friedan)\n- (betty friedan, born on, february 4, 1921)\n- (second-wave feminism, occurred in, united states)\n- (betty friedan, co-founded, national organization for women)\n- (betty friedan, was a, activist)\n- (betty friedan, wrote, the feminine mystique)\n- (census, reported, 2016)\n- (census, reported, $59,039)\n- (betty friedan, was a leading figure in, women's movement)\n- (real median level, was, $59,039)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets. Mandatory markets losing both CBC and Radio-Canada over-the-air signals include London, Ontario (metropolitan area population 457,000) and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (metro area population 257,000). In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline. Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP). All CBC O&O stations have a standard call letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are \"CB\" (an ITU prefix allocated not to Canada, but to Chile) and the last letter is \"T\".\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (cbc o&o stations, use, call letters)\n- (cbc, published, digital transition plans)\n- (cbc, converted, analogue transmitters)\n- (analogue retransmitters, converted, digital)\n- (cbc o&o stations, use, cbc brand)\n- (canadian broadcasters, converted, digital)\n- (canadian digital television transition, deadline, august 31, 2011)\n- (toronto's cblt, use, psip)\n- (cbc, reported, financial difficulties)\n- (itu prefix, allocated, chile)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It sold at auction in 2002 for C$5.1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at that time. It was purchased by media magnate Ken Thomson, who donated it to the Art Gallery of Ontario. The painting depicts British explorer John Henry Lefroy on his successful expedition to map the Magnetic North Pole. A largely self-educated artist, Paul Kane grew up in Toronto (then known as York) and trained himself by copying European masters on a \"Grand Tour\" study trip through Europe. He undertook two voyages through the Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848. The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie and back. Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria. The Toronto Coach Terminal is the central bus station for inter-city services in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 610 Bay Street, in the city's Downtown. The terminal is owned by Toronto Coach Terminal Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC managed the station directly until July 8, 2012, when it was leased out in its entirety to bus lines Coach Canada and Greyhound Canada for $1.2 million annually. Opened in 1931 as the Gray Coach Terminal, the Art Deco style terminal was home base for Gray Coach, an interurban bus service then owned by the TTC.

Like adjacent Upper Lusatia in the south, Lower Lusatia is a settlement area of the West Slavic Sorbs whose endangered Lower Sorbian language is related to Upper Sorbian and Polish. In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the Roman Empire allowed different tribes of Central Europe (Suebi, Vandals and Alani) to cross the Rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi. In 585, the Visigothic King Leovigild invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (suebi, were allies of, roman empire)\n- (lower lusatia, stretches from, german state of brandenburg)\n- (briton colony, was established in, northern galicia)\n- (britonia, was established in, northern galicia)\n- (vandals, crossed, rhine)\n- (briton colony, was established as allies of, suebi)\n- (visigothic king leovigild, invaded, suebic kingdom of galicia)\n- (lower lusatia, is a historical region in, central europe)\n- (bishopric, was established in, northern galicia)\n- (lower lusatia, is a settlement area of, west slavic sorbs)\n- (lubusz voivodeship, is in, poland)\n- (suebi, crossed, rhine)\n- (alani, crossed, rhine)\n- (lower lusatia, stretches to, lubusz voivodeship)\n- (suebi, settled in, galicia)\n- (visigothic king leovigild, brought under, visigoth control)\n- (lower sorbian language, is related to, polish)\n- (lower sorbian language, is related to, upper sorbian)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia. East Timor is also predominantly Roman Catholic due to a history of Portuguese rule. The tentacled snake or tentacle snake (Erpeton tentaculatum), is a rear-fanged aquatic snake native to South-East Asia. It is the only species of its genus, Erpeton, and the two tentacles on its snout are a unique feature among snakes. The method it uses to catch fish has recently been a subject of research. According to recent estimates, 50% of the population adheres to Christianity, Islam 48%, while 2% of the population follows other religions including traditional African religion and animism. According to a study made by Pew Research Center, 63% adheres to Christianity and 36% adheres to Islam. Since May 2002, the government of Eritrea has officially recognized the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Oriental Orthodox), Sunni Islam, the Eritrean Catholic Church (a Metropolitanate sui juris) and the Evangelical Lutheran church. All other faiths and denominations are required to undergo a registration process. Among other things, the government's registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership to be allowed to worship.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (buddhism, is predominant in, burma)\n- (buddhism, is predominant in, singapore)\n- (buddhism, is predominant in, laos)\n- (islam, has majorities in, malaysia)\n- (east timor, is predominantly roman catholic due to, portuguese rule)\n- (buddhism, is predominant in, vietnam)\n- (eritrea, has officially recognized, sunni islam)\n- (confucianism, is practised in, singapore)\n- (islam, has majorities in, southern philippines)\n- (eritrea, has officially recognized, eritrean orthodox tewahedo church)\n- (ancestor worship, is practised in, singapore)\n- (eritrea, has officially recognized, evangelical lutheran church)\n- (islam, has majorities in, brunei)\n- (buddhism, is predominant in, cambodia)\n- (buddhism, is predominant in, thailand)\n- (christianity, is predominant in, philippines)\n- (eritrea, has officially recognized, eritrean catholic church)\n- (islam, has majorities in, indonesia)\n- (confucianism, is practised in, vietnam)\n- (ancestor worship, is practised in, vietnam)\n- (christianity, is predominant in, east malaysia)\n- (islam, is the most widely practised religion in, southeast asia)\n- (christianity, is predominant in, east timor)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Apple's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS GUI. From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead.

The three major American broadcast networks are all headquartered in New York: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Many cable networks are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO, Showtime, Bravo, Food Network, AMC, and Comedy Central. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYCTV, that has produced several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods and city government. The Cube is an hour-long teleplay that aired on NBC's weekly anthology television show \"NBC Experiment in Television\" in 1969. The production was produced and directed by puppeteer and filmmaker Jim Henson, and was one of several experiments with the live-action film medium which he conducted in the 1960s, before focusing entirely on \"The Muppets\" and other puppet works. The screenplay was co-written by long-time Muppet writer Jerry Juhl. Celebrity Big Brother also known as Big Brother: Celebrity Edition is a spin - off series of the American reality television series Big Brother. This season will air during the winter of the 2017 -- 18 network television season on CBS and will be the second U.S. Big Brother season to air outside the usual summer television season, the first being Big Brother 9 in 2008. Julie Chen will return as host, with Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan returning as executive producers. The season will be produced by Fly on the Wall Entertainment in association with Endemol Shine North America.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, believed, assumption of mary)\n- (martin luther, was a firm adherent of, immaculate conception)\n- (martin luther, criticized, papists)\n- (martin luther, had harsh polemics against, roman catholic opponents)\n- (pope pius ix, dogmatized, immaculate conception)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.

She was born either a deaf-mute or just deaf and mentally challenged and was very sickly. She possibly had a degenerative disease, did not survive her fourth year and died at Windsor. Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the abbey. In 1216, Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne, because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral. This coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the abbey on 17 May 1220. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the traditional cleric in the coronation ceremony.[citation needed]\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (katherine of england, child of, henry iii)\n- (henry iii, crowned in, gloucester cathedral)\n- (katherine of england, died at, windsor)\n- (katherine of england, child of, eleanor of provence)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Three Nobel laureates, several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centres. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006, making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as Ciudad Universitaria, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. Born in Mexico city, he studied civil engineering at UNAM. He became president of the student society of the Faculty of Sciences in 1936 and University Counsellor in 1938. He taught for more than 20 years in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria (a high school of UNAM) and the National School of Engineering (later Faculty of Engineering), of whom he was director from 1955 to 1958. He became Rector on May 5, 1966. During his rectorship, the government and the army entered Ciudad Universitaria, UNAM's main campus. In protest of these actions and the indiscriminate beating of UNAM's students, he resigned his post on September 23, 9 days before the massacre in Tlatelolco. He was reinstated as Rector after the liberation of CU, a post he held until May 5, 1970.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (national autonomous university of mexico, includes, mexican entrepreneurs)\n- (escuela nacional preparatoria, part of, unam)\n- (rector, resigned after, tlatelolco)\n- (national autonomous university of mexico, ranked by, times higher education)\n- (national autonomous university of mexico, located in, mexico city)\n- (national autonomous university of mexico, includes, mexico's modern-day presidents)\n- (world heritage site, by, unesco)\n- (national school of engineering, later became, faculty of engineering)\n- (ciudad universitaria, named, world heritage site)\n- (faculty of engineering, part of, unam)\n- (national autonomous university of mexico, includes, nobel laureates)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.

Jackson Township is one of eleven townships in Randolph County, Indiana, United States. As of the 2010 census, its population was 619 and it contained 250 housing units. Owing to its role in the state's history, the county motto is \"Where Illinois Began.\" It contains the historically important village of Kaskaskia, Illinois's first capital. Springfield's original name was Calhoun, after Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory.

Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households. The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top. As a result, the mean tends to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. Aaron Spelling (April 22, 1923 \u2013 June 23, 2006) was an American film and television producer. Some of his works include the TV programs Charlie's Angels (1976\u201381), The Love Boat (1977\u201386), Hart to Hart (1979\u201384), Dynasty (1981\u201389), Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990\u20132000), 7th Heaven (1996\u20132007), and Charmed (1998\u20132006). He also served as producer of Mod Squad (1968-1973), The Rookies (1972-1976), and Sunset Beach (1997-1999). This was one of the few failures from Aaron Spelling's production company in its history, since it was picked by ABC to debut right after the Super Bowl in 1985 and was heavily promoted during the game.

It was destroyed in 1828 by the Thais, who burned and pillaged Vientiane following the defeat of the last king of the Vientiane dynasty of Lan Xang, Chao Anouvong. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs.

After both the album and its singles failed to chart in the United States (although \"I Will (Take You Forever)\" did chart in several other countries) and due in large part to the general decline in sales beginning with \"Another Page\" (1983), Cross was soon released from Warner Bros. \"Swept Away\" was previously heard on a few episodes of the TV show \"Growing Pains\" in 1987. It would be nearly five years until Cross signed a new recording contract with BMG and release a new album, \"Rendezvous\", in 1993. \"Think of Laura\" is a popular song by the American Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Christopher Cross. Released as a single in late 1983 from Cross' second studio album, \"Another Page\", \"Think of Laura\" became the singer's fourth (and, to date, final) single to reach the Top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at #9 in early 1984. The song spent eleven weeks in the Top 40. In addition, the song became Cross' third single to hit #1 on the adult contemporary chart, following \"Never Be the Same\" and \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\". \"Think of Laura\" remained at #1 on this chart for four weeks.

The first executions on the electric chair were on February 8, 1924, when Charles Reynolds, Ewell Morris, George Washington, Mack Matthews, and Melvin Johnson had their death sentences carried out. The five executions were the most carried out on a single day in the state. The state would conduct multiple executions on a single day on several other occasions, the last being on August 9, 2000. Since then, the state has not executed more than one person on a single day, though there is no law prohibiting it.

Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973\u20131048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981\u20131037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt. One of the common definitions for \"Islamic philosophy\" is \"the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.\" Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. The Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980\u20131037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook The Canon of Medicine was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries. He also wrote The Book of Healing, an influential scientific and philosophical encyclopedia.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ibn sina, drew from, indian scientific literature)\n- (fielding h. garrison, opinion that origin of geology traced to, persia)\n- (ibn sina, wrote, the canon of medicine)\n- (abu al-rayhan al-biruni, wrote about geology of, india)\n- (shen kuo, observed fossil animal shells in, china)\n- (ibn sina, wrote, the book of healing)\n- (ibn sina, drew from, greek scientific literature)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Macbeth (/ m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8 /; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.

Owned by Midlands Media Group LLC, the station broadcasts a country music format branded as 94.3 The Dude. John Doby Kennedy (January 5, 1840 \u2013 April 14, 1896) was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, as well as a post-war planter, attorney, politician, and the 57th Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina serving under Governor Johnson Hagood. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers. Forest Acres is a city in Richland County, South Carolina, United States.

A leading figure in the women's movement in the United States, her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often credited with sparking the second wave of American feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women \"into the mainstream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men.\" Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income. Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households. The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top. As a result, the mean tends to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. The Feminine Mystique is a book written by Betty Friedan which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second - wave feminism in the United States. It was published on February 19, 1963 by W.W. Norton.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (betty friedan, was elected first president of, national organization for women)\n- (the feminine mystique, is credited with sparking, american feminism)\n- (the feminine mystique, was published by, w.w. norton)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Tito was interred in a mausoleum in Belgrade, which forms part of a memorial complex in the grounds of the Museum of Yugoslav History (formerly called \"Museum 25 May\" and \"Museum of the Revolution\"). The actual mausoleum is called House of Flowers (Kuc\u0301a Cvec\u0301a) and numerous people visit the place as a shrine to \"better times\". The museum keeps the gifts Tito received during his presidency. The collection also includes original prints of Los Caprichos by Francisco Goya, and many others. The Government of Serbia has planned to merge it into the Museum of the History of Serbia. At the time of his death, speculation began about whether his successors could continue to hold Yugoslavia together. Ethnic divisions and conflict grew and eventually erupted in a series of Yugoslav wars a decade after his death.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Muse\u0301e d'Orsay in Paris. Jean De\u0301sire\u0301 Gustave Courbet (; 10 June 1819 \u2013 31 December 1877) was a French painter who led the Realism movement in 19th-century French painting.

On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (joseph stalin, established, soviet union)\n- (nikita khrushchev, announced the continuation of the war on, imperialism)\n- (joseph stalin, created the model for, stalinist states)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.

Given the rationing of clothing at the time, she still had to purchase the material using ration coupons. The dress was designed by Norman Hartnell. Hartnell's signature was said to be embroidery, and he enjoyed \"working with soft, floating fabrics, particularly tulle and chiffon, and with plain, lustrous silks\". The dress was made of soft Damascus Prokar, with a high neckline, tailored bodice and a short train.

Two years later, he ascended to the throne of England as King James I of England. Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery.

In the opener of Season 4, the two characters are revealed to be dating, and as such, other character romances, such as the romance between fellow co-workers Dwight Schrute and Angela Martin, begin to move more toward the forefront of episodes. In Season 6, Jim and Pam are married in the season's 4th and 5th episodes (hour long), a feat considered noteworthy by many television critics, as bringing together the two lead love interests in a television series is often thought to be a risky venture. Their child is born in the second half of the season, during another hour long,`` The Delivery''. Pam and Jim's second child is born during season 8. In season 9, their marriage becomes strained when Jim takes up a second job in Philadelphia. They ultimately decide to leave Dunder Mifflin together so Jim can pursue his dream job. Jim and Pam marry early in the season, at Niagara Falls, during the highly anticipated, hour long episode, ``Niagara ''. The ending of the episode, in which their co-workers dance down the aisle, is an imitation of a viral YouTube video -- JK Wedding Entrance Dance. Following the wedding, a multi-episode story arc begins in which it is revealed that Michael hooked up with Pam's mother the night of the wedding.

However, arrangements in the UK were also called 'anti-aircraft', abbreviated as AA, a term that remained in general use into the 1950s. After the First World War it was sometimes prefixed by 'Light' or 'Heavy' (LAA or HAA) to classify a type of gun or unit. Nicknames for anti-aircraft guns include AA, AAA or triple-A, an abbreviation of anti-aircraft artillery; \"ack-ack\" (from the spelling alphabet used by the British for voice transmission of \"AA\"); and archie (a World War I British term probably coined by Amyas Borton and believed to derive via the Royal Flying Corps from the music-hall comedian George Robey's line \"Archibald, certainly not!\"). Doing His Bit is a 1917 British silent comedy film directed by Edwin J. Collins and starring George Robey and Marjorie Hume and Howard Boddey.

The Ottoman Empire stood between the West and the East, thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing Spanish and Portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the Orient. The Empire controlled the spice route that Marco Polo once used. When Vasco da Gama bypassed Ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with India in 1498, and Christopher Columbus first journeyed to the Bahamas in 1492, the Ottoman Empire was at its zenith. In the Footsteps of Marco Polo is a 2008 PBS documentary film detailing Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell's 1993 retracing of Marco Polo's journey from Venice to Anatolia, Persia, India and China. The movie documents the first quest \"to visit and document every region Marco Polo claimed to have traveled\" using only land and sea methods of transportation. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" writes that the documentary includes how Belliveau and O'Donnell \"encountered Mongol horsemen and hostile Chinese security officers and survived a firefight between Afghan factions. In the spirit of Polo's journey -- and to prove a point regarding the authenticity of his account -- they disdained airplanes, traveling by foot, on horses and camels and by jeep, boat and train.\" A text by the same name as the video, \"In the Footsteps of Marco Polo\", written by Belliveau and O'Donnell, and published by Rowman & Littlefield, serves as a companion to the documentary film. \"In the Footsteps of Marco Polo\" has been used by Belliveau to create a unique interdisciplinary educational curriculum that he presents at schools and libraries across the United States and internationally. In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ottoman empire, stood between, east)\n- (marco polo, used, spice route)\n- (denis belliveau, retraced journey of, marco polo)\n- (denis belliveau, presents curriculum in, united states)\n- (denis belliveau, encountered, chinese security officers)\n- (ottoman empire, controlled, spice route)\n- (denis belliveau, encountered, mongol horsemen)\n- (francis o'donnell, retraced journey of, marco polo)\n- (christopher columbus, journeyed to, bahamas)\n- (denis belliveau, survived firefight between, afghan factions)\n- (ottoman empire, stood between, west)\n- (mike hale, writes for, the new york times)\n- (vasco da gama, established trade links with, india)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The band also played on Broadway for the play \"Porgy\" by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the real Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage. Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel into the now famous opera, Porgy and Bess (so named so as to distinguish it from the play).

This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits.

Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa: During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

The urban area of San Diego extends beyond the administrative city limits and had a total population of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest urban area in the state, after that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and San Francisco metropolitan area. They, along with the Riverside\u2013San Bernardino, form those metropolitan areas in California larger than the San Diego metropolitan area, with a total population of 3,095,313 at the 2010 census. \"Getting Away with Murder\" is the first single from the band Papa Roach's third album, \"Getting Away with Murder\". The song shows the band's new sound, the sound of the song is hard rock instead of their previous nu metal sound. The song also features no rapping at all, something that was used in Papa Roach's previous singles. The video is performance-based, showing the band playing in a Stock Exchange Hall with references filled with fans (including sexual imagery which led the band's lead singer Jacoby Shaddix to describe the video as \"stocks and bondage\" in an MTV2 interview).

He was the flag bearer of Myanmar sports team at the opening ceremony. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (zaw win thet, born in, pathein district)\n- (zaw win thet, born in, ayeyarwady division)\n- (zaw win thet, competed in, 2012 summer olympics)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, employed, coinage)\n- (zaw win thet, is a, runner)\n- (zaw win thet, born in, myanmar)\n- (zaw win thet, competed in, 400 m event)\n- (zaw win thet, is a, burmese)\n- (zaw win thet, born in, kyonpyaw)\n- (coinage, proclaimed, economic independence)\n- (zaw win thet, was the flag bearer of, myanmar sports team)\n- (western european states, avoided, ottoman trade monopoly)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

For the next three seasons he played occasionally for the first team either at full back or as Trevor Smith's deputy at centre-half, most notably in the first leg of the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final against A.S. Roma. When Smith sustained the injury that resulted in him leaving the club, Foster took over at centre half and kept his place for another couple of seasons. He was used less frequently in his last two years at the club, and spent three months on loan at Crewe Alexandra before making a permanent move to Plymouth Argyle where he ended his Football League career. He went on to play for Chelmsford City and Bromsgrove Rovers, and spent one season as Bromsgrove's assistant manager. The Trophy was stolen from a display in the shop window of W. Shillcock (a football fitter) in Newton Row, Birmingham, after the Final and never recovered despite a \u00a310 reward.

Jagmohan has stated that this and what followed shows the \"glaring\" \"failure of the government machinery\".On 3 June 1947, the partition plan was accepted by the Congress Working Committee. Boloji states that in Punjab there were no riots but there was communal tension, while Gandhi was reportedly isolated by Nehru and Patel and observed maun vrat (day of silence). Mountbatten visited Gandhi and said he hoped that he would not oppose the partition, to which Gandhi wrote the reply: \"Have I ever opposed you?\"Within British India, the border between India and Pakistan (the Radcliffe Line) was determined by a British Government-commissioned report prepared under the chairmanship of a London barrister, Sir Cyril Radcliffe.

India was formed out of the majority Hindu regions of British India, and Pakistan from the majority Muslim areas. The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion.

Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established late due to mutual hostility. During World War II, the two countries were briefly allies. At the end of the war, the first signs of post-war mistrust and hostility began to appear between the two countries, escalating into the Cold War; a period of tense hostile relations, with periods of de\u0301tente. Passive air defence is defined by NATO as \"Passive measures taken for the physical defence and protection of personnel, essential installations and equipment in order to minimize the effectiveness of air and/or missile attack\". It remains a vital activity by ground forces and includes camouflage and concealment to avoid detection by reconnaissance and attacking aircraft. Measures such as camouflaging important buildings were common in the Second World War. During the Cold War the runways and taxiways of some airfields were painted green.

It is celebrated by Egyptians as an annual holiday for two weeks starting August 15, known as Wafaa El - Nil. It is also celebrated in the Coptic Church by ceremonially throwing a martyr's relic into the river, hence the name, The Martyr's Finger (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca7\u2c8f\u2c83 \u2c9b\u2c99\u2c81\u2ca3\u2ca7\u2c8f\u2ca3\u2c9f\u2ca5, Arabic: Esba `al - shahi\u0304d ). Ancient Egyptians believed that the Nile flooded every year because of Isis's tears of sorrow for her dead husband, Osiris. Shuman built the world\u2019s first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt, between 1912 and 1913. Shuman\u2019s plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45\u201352 kilowatts (60\u201370 hp) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres (4,800 imp gal; 5,800 US gal) of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman\u2019s vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.

The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Ce\u0301vennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Loze\u0300re. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

He became Austrian minister in Turin at the court of King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, in St. Petersburg at the court of Catherine the Great, and then Paris at the court of King Louis XV of France in 1766. In Paris, his first work was to strengthen the alliance between France and Austria, which was cemented in 1770 by the marriage of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XVI, with Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria, youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, afterwards known as Queen Marie Antoinette. When Louis and Marie Antoinette ascended the throne of France in 1774, Mercy-Argenteau became one of the most powerful personages at the French court due to his influence over Marie-Antoinette, which made her unpopular with the French nobility and French people. He was in Paris during the turbulent years that led up to the French Revolution, and gave powerful aid to the finance ministers Lome\u0301nie de Brienne and Necker. In 1792, he became governor-general of the Austrian Netherlands, which had just been reduced to obedience by Austria. There, his ability and experience made him a very successful ruler. Although at first in favor of moderate courses, Mercy-Argenteau supported the action of Austria in making war upon its former ally after the outbreak of the French Revolution, and in July 1794, he was appointed Austrian ambassador to Britain, but he died a few days after his arrival in London.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, gave aid to, lome\u0301nie de brienne)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, became governor-general of, austrian netherlands)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, was appointed ambassador to, britain)\n- (louis xvi, ascended the throne with, marie antoinette)\n- (austria, made war upon, france)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, was at the court of, king charles emmanuel iii of sardinia)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, became austrian minister in, turin)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, died in, london)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, gave aid to, necker)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, had influence over, marie antoinette)\n- (archduchess maria antonia of austria, was known as, queen marie antoinette)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, strengthened the alliance between, austria)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, entered the diplomatic service of, austria)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, strengthened the alliance between, france)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, was at the court of, king louis xv of france)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, was in the train of, reichsfu\u0308rst kaunitz)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, was in paris during, french revolution)\n- (archduchess maria antonia of austria, was the daughter of, empress maria theresa)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, supported the action of, austria)\n- (antoine, comte de mercy-argenteau, was at the court of, catherine the great)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Laurean Rugambwa (July 12, 1912 \u2013 December 8, 1997) was the first modern native African Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Dar es Salaam from 1968 to 1992, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1960. Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, believed, theotokos)\n- (martin luther, adhered to, ecumenical councils)\n- (martin luther, believed, mother of god)\n- (martin luther, adhered to, the church)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism. On 18 June 1948, the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2 calling for covert action against the USSR, and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against \"hostile foreign states or groups\" that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government. To this end, the Office of Policy Coordination was created inside the new CIA. The OPC was quite unique; Frank Wisner, the head of the OPC, answered not to the CIA Director, but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC, and the OPC's actions were a secret even from the head of the CIA. Most CIA stations had two station chiefs, one working for the OSO, and one working for the OPC.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (office of policy coordination, created inside, cia)\n- (cia, had station chiefs working for, opc)\n- (frank wisner, head of, opc)\n- (cia, had station chiefs working for, oso)\n- (national security council, issued, directive 10/2)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. In France, the immigration of Jews from Algeria (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim. Only in Israel is the Jewish population representative of all groups, a melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall world Jewish population. A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated \"Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry\", as both groups \u2013 the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews \u2013 shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ashkenazi jews, represent, modern jewry)\n- (middle eastern jews, shared common ancestors in, middle east)\n- (european/syrian jews, shared common ancestors in, middle east)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. A Don is a village in south-eastern Laos near the border with Vietnam. It is located in Kaleum District in Sekong Province. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years.

Philosophy, Fiqh and theology (kalaam) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. Al-Razi and Al-Farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamadan. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. Aruzi Samarqandi describes how before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met Al-Biruni (a famous scientist and astronomer), Abu Nasr Iraqi (a renowned mathematician), Abu Sahl Masihi (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician). Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries.

The brand was originally produced and owned by the R. Monarch Distillery (RD #24, 2nd Dist.) of Owensboro, Kentucky, which entered bankruptcy in 1898 and was purchased by James Thompson in 1901 who renamed the company Glenmore Distillery Company with locations in Owensboro and Louisville, Kentucky. In 1903 The Kentucky Tavern trademark was first registered. Glenmore proved a successful and durable company, its main brand being Kentucky Tavern. It is usually produced as an 80 proof liquor, although a 100 proof is also available. Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases, and the introduction of clinical pharmacology. One of the common definitions for \"Islamic philosophy\" is \"the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.\" Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. The Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980\u20131037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine. His medical textbook The Canon of Medicine was used as the standard text in European universities for centuries.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.

The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.

Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004. Presbyterian denominations that trace their heritage to the British Isles usually organise their church services inspired by the principles in the Directory of Public Worship, developed by the Westminster Assembly in the 1640s. This directory documented Reformed worship practices and theology adopted and developed over the preceding century by British Puritans, initially guided by John Calvin and John Knox. It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (scottish parliament building, located in, holyrood)\n- (rmjm, led by, tony kettle)\n- (scottish parliament, has official home, scottish parliament building)\n- (scottish parliament building, designed by, enric miralles)\n- (enric miralles, partnered with, rmjm)\n- (westminster assembly, guided by, john knox)\n- (directory of public worship, developed by, westminster assembly)\n- (queen elizabeth ii, opened, scottish parliament building)\n- (directory of public worship, adopted by, british puritans)\n- (presbyterian denominations, trace heritage to, british isles)\n- (directory of public worship, enacted as law by, scottish parliament)\n- (scottish parliament building, located in, edinburgh)\n- (westminster assembly, guided by, john calvin)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Mother-in-Law Lounge is a live music venue, pub and a shrine in New Orleans, Louisiana dedicated to the memory of rhythm and blues singer, Ernie K-Doe.

The song is a slight return to the band early work, starting with a rapping introduction, but as the introduction goes the rapping then goes into fast screaming making it different from the usual rapping of the band's early releases. Most of the song is singing with Jacoby singing in the verses and also choruses. The song follows the band's hard rock sound of their previous album. The song hit American radio stations on August 7, 2006. The song was played in full on Kerrang! Radio in the United Kingdom on August 1, 2006 and has since become available to download via the iTunes Store and Walmart Downloads store as a radio edit version. On September 18 the single became available in UK stores as a 7\" vinyl picture disc with a complimentary Papa Roach sticker. The CD was released on October 11, 2006. The song was used as the official theme song for \"WWE Raw\" on the USA Network from October 9, 2006 to November 9, 2009. The song has risen to #8 on the \"Mainstream Rock Tracks\" and #14 on the \"Modern Rock Tracks\" and played during the theatrical trailer of the 2008 film Never Back Down.

Roger Sherman of Connecticut, believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers, which did not include establishing a national religion.

However, the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment. Forest Acres is a city in Richland County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141\u201387 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers. The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science.

It was shot at Denham Studios. The film's sets were designed by the art director Frederick Pusey. The term air defence was probably first used by Britain when Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) was created as a Royal Air Force command in 1925.

It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial. The Worship of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Titian completed between 1518\u20131519, housed at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. It describes a Roman rite of worship conducted in honour of the goddess Venus each 1 April. On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to cleanse \"every blemish on their bodies\". In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population.

The karst limestone cave was only discovered in April 2004 by a local farmer who upon entering it found a treasure trove of 229 Buddha statues, estimated to be over 450 years old. It is believed that the Buddha statues were hidden to prevent them being looted by invading Haw peoples. The largest Buddha statue is seated at the main entrance. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (restored toungoo kings, created a legal and political framework in, irrawaddy valley)\n- (portuguese, were defeated by, restored toungoo kings)\n- (tham pha, is located in, khammouane province)\n- (khammouane province, is located in, laos)\n- (siam, were defeated by, restored toungoo kings)\n- (tham pha, is also known as, buddha cave)\n- (ava, was part of, toungoo dynasty)\n- (restored hanthawaddy kingdom, sacked, ava)\n- (western european states, discovered, cape of good hope)\n- (buddha statues, were hidden to prevent being looted by, haw peoples)\n- (ottoman, had a trade monopoly avoided by, western european states)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. WWNQ is a radio station licensed to Forest Acres, South Carolina, serving the Columbia, South Carolina market. Owned by Midlands Media Group LLC, the station broadcasts a country music format branded as 94.3 The Dude. Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line and those south of it, primarily centered on the \"peculiar institution\" of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South seceded from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was loyal to the Union. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (wwnq, serves the, columbia)\n- (forest acres, is a city in, united states)\n- (forest acres, is a city in, south carolina)\n- (confederate states of america, opened fire on, fort sumter)\n- (fort sumter, was loyal to, union)\n- (wwnq, is a radio station licensed to, forest acres)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The main cause was opposition to the Kansas -- Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The Northern Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The first public meeting of the general ``anti-Nebraska ''movement where the name`` Republican'' was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854, in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party. The Kansas -- Nebraska Act divided the nation and pointed it toward civil war. The Act itself virtually nullified the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

After she signed to MGM, it was reissued as her second single on that label on August 5, 1952, after Jo Stafford, Patti Page and Dean Martin had covered it. James' version also was issued on M-G-M Records for national distribution. The best - known early 1952 version of the song was recorded after James' recording by Sue Thompson on Mercury's country label as catalog number 6407. It was soon covered by Patti Page, whose version was issued by Mercury as catalog number 5899, with ``I Went to Your Wedding ''(a bigger Patti Page hit, reaching No 1) on the flip side. It entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, and lasted 12 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 4.

Unlike the stipendiary system at Bow Street, the river police were full-time, salaried officers prohibited from taking private fees. His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames. Colquhoun's innovations were a critical development leading up to Robert Peel's \"new\" police three decades later. Peel was the second son of Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his first wife Ellen (ne\u0301e Yates). He was the younger brother of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, and the elder brother of Jonathan Peel. He was educated at Harrow and St John's College, Cambridge. Peel sat as Member of Parliament for Bossiney from 1817 to 1818, for Tamworth from 1818 to 1830, 1835 to 1837 and in 1847, for Yarmouth from 1830 to 1831 and for Cambridge University from 1831 to 1832 and served under the Duke of Wellington as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1828 to 1830 and as a Lord of the Treasury under Wellington in 1830 and again under his brother Sir Robert Peel from 1834 to 1835.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Nam Khan is a river in Laos. It flows through Luang Prabang. It is a major tributary of the river Mekong, with which it joins at Luang Prabang. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (nam khan, is a tributary of, mekong)\n- (nam khan, is in, laos)\n- (nam khan, flows through, luang prabang)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. During a meeting at Atlantic Hotel (Hamburg) in 1953, a group of Iranian residents of Germany discussed the need to establish their own religious center. A letter was sent to the late Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi asking him for help; Grand Ayatollah agreed with the plan and donated 100,000 Rials to the center. The construction began in 1960 and by 1965 it was completed. In the same year Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti was appointed to lead the center. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast.

He undertook two voyages through the Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848. The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie and back. Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria. Casa Loma (Spanish for ``Hill House '') is a Gothic Revival style mansion and garden in midtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that is now a historic house museum and landmark. It was constructed from 1911 to 1914 as a residence for financier Sir Henry Pellatt. The architect was E. J. Lennox, who designed several other city landmarks. Casa Loma sits at an elevation of 140 metres (460 ft) above sea level. Scene in the Northwest: Portrait of John Henry Lefroy, also known as The Surveyor, is a painting by Paul Kane circa 1845. It sold at auction in 2002 for C$5.1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at that time.

It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.

During the Korean War, the movement of United Nations troops approaching the river precipitated massive Chinese intervention from around Dandong. In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the Sino -- Korean Friendship Bridge connecting Sinuiju, North Korea to Dandong, China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of dogfights for air superiority over North Korea, earning the nickname ``MiG Alley ''in reference to the MiG - 15 fighters flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese and Soviet forces. For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought, but exchanged little territory; the stalemate held. Large - scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong. On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team. Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the UN Command forces' goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory. The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (kpa, conducted operations against, un command)\n- (pva, conducted operations against, un command)\n- (chinese intervention, occurred from, dandong)\n- (korean side of the river, was industrialized during, japanese rule)\n- (mig alley, was named in reference to, mig-15 fighters)\n- (sino-korean friendship bridge, connects, sinuiju)\n- (un command, fought against, kpa)\n- (united nations troops, approached, dandong)\n- (mig-15 fighters, were flown by, north korean forces)\n- (un command, fought against, pva)\n- (un command, aimed to recapture, south korea)\n- (imperial japan, had industrial output from, korea)\n- (mig-15 fighters, were flown by, soviet forces)\n- (sino-korean friendship bridge, connects, dandong)\n- (mig-15 fighters, were flown by, chinese forces)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians. In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations (1948), Stalin published Falsifiers of History, which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution. Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy - year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (joseph stalin, succeeded, vladimir lenin)\n- (falsifiers of history, included claim about, hitler)\n- (chairman of the council of ministers, comparable to, premier)\n- (armenians, experienced contrast with, ottoman empire)\n- (1977 constitution of the union of soviet socialist republics, defined role of, chairman of the council of ministers)\n- (tsfsr, divided into, armenian ssr)\n- (tsfsr, divided into, azerbaijan ssr)\n- (tsfsr, divided into, georgian ssr)\n- (joseph stalin, published, falsifiers of history)\n- (armenians, received provisions from, moscow)\n- (1977 constitution of the union of soviet socialist republics, defined role of, chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet)\n- (general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union (cpsu), led, soviet union)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. Caspar Voght (17 November 1752 \u2013 20 March 1839), later Caspar Reichsfreiherr von Voght (more commonly known as Baron Caspar von Voght), was a German merchant and social reformer from Hamburg (today Germany). Together with his business partner and friend Georg Heinrich Sieveking he led one of the largest trading firms in Hamburg during the second half of the 18th Century. On numerous trade trips, he completely crossed the European continent. One of his greatest achievements was reforming the welfare system of Hamburg. From 1785 he dedicated himself to strengthening agricultural and horticultural projects and built a model agricultural community in Flottbek, close to the gates of Hamburg. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast.

Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in June 2005, she released her second solo album, B'Day (2006), which contained hits \"De\u0301ja\u0300 Vu\", \"Irreplaceable\", and \"Beautiful Liar\". Beyonce\u0301 also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am...

There are many Hokkien speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia as well as in the United States. Many ethnic Han Chinese emigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian, and brought the language to what is now Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies) and present day Malaysia and Singapore (formerly Malaya and the British Straits Settlements). Many of the Hokkien dialects of this region are highly similar to Taiwanese and Amoy.

(also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Drac's Night Out is the title of an unreleased video game developed by Mark Lesser and Rex Bradford of Microsmiths that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (pc engine, is known as, turbografx-16)\n- (drac's night out, was produced for, nintendo entertainment system)\n- (drac's night out, featured sponsorship of, reebok pump)\n- (mega drive, was launched in, north america)\n- (sega enterprises, is known as, sega)\n- (mega drive, is known as, genesis)\n- (drac's night out, was developed by, mark lesser)\n- (pc engine, was launched in, north america)\n- (drac's night out, was developed by, rex bradford)\n- (drac's night out, was developed by, microsmiths)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

These influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion. During Spanish colonial rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to Roman Catholicism and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from Spanish trade between Mesoamerica and Asia. The modern Chamorro language is a Malayo-Polynesian language with much Spanish and Filipino influence. Many Chamorros also have Spanish surnames because of their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the adoption of names from the Cata\u0301logo alfabe\u0301tico de apellidos, a phenomenon also common to the Philippines. Many Christians still practice their traditional cultural beliefs and rituals along with Christianity. The Catholic Church has fused some aspects of local culture into its services. For example, the singing of hymns during services has developed into a local and traditional way of singing (a repetitive call and response style) in Sesotho, the indigenous language, as well as English. In addition priests are seen dressed in local dress during services.

The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Katharina von Bora (; 29 January 1499 \u2013 20 December 1552), after her wedding Katharina Luther, also referred to as \"die Lutherin\" (\"the Lutheress\"), was the wife of Martin Luther, German reformer and a seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. Beyond what is found in the writings of Luther and some of his contemporaries, little is known about her.

Today the library district consists of the nearly 80,000 square foot Main Library located in Yuma as well as branches in downtown Yuma, the Foothills, Somerton, San Luis, Wellton, Dateland, and Roll. The first Yuma Library, a Carnegie library, opened February 24, 1921 with 1,053 volumes and seating for 20 persons. Located in Sunset Park, the Yuma Carnegie Library underwent several expansions and renovations over the years, including a $4.2 million renovation completed in 2009. The Yuma Carnegie library still operates today as the Heritage Branch Library in downtown Yuma. After a hiatus of eleven years, the race was revived by the Verizon IndyCar Series in 2016. It was held on Saturday night under the lights. Long considered a popular Indy car track, Phoenix has a rich history of open wheel races, including a spectacular crash involving Johnny Rutherford (1980), and the final career victory for Indy legend Mario Andretti (1993).

It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted.

The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers. Ocean Forest Country Club, also known as Ocean Forest Hotel and Country Club, is a historic country club and hotel located at Myrtle Beach in Horry County, South Carolina. The club and hotel were designed by an influential New York architect, Raymond Hood (1881-1934) and is an unusual example of Classical Revival architecture. Construction of the club began in 1926 and was completed in 1927. In addition to the hotel / club building, a 27-hole golf course was built in association with the club. It was designed by Robert White, a golf course designer and future president of the Professional Golfers' Association of America. The present 18-hole course dates to 1946.

Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin. Jean Mathonet (6 October 1925, Be\u0301verce\u0301, Malmedy \u2013 22 October 2004, Malmedy) was a Belgian football player who finished top scorer of the Belgian First Division with 26 goals in 1956 while playing for Standard Lie\u0300ge.

With the completion of a pipeline connection to the oil terminal at Sullom Voe in Shetland, the storage facility had continued in use, but by 1991, was considered to be of no further value. Brent Spar became an issue of public concern in 1995, when the British government announced its support for Shell's application for its disposal in deep Atlantic waters at North Feni Ridge (approximately from the west coast of Scotland, at a depth of around ). On 27 August 2007, Royal Dutch Shell and Reitan Group, the owner of the 7-Eleven brand in Scandinavia, announced an agreement to re-brand some 269 service stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals under the different competition laws in each country. On April 2010 Shell announced that the corporation is in process of trying to find a potential buyer for all of its operations in Finland and is doing similar market research concerning Swedish operations.

He dedicated a large amount of his academic life to lecturing both domestically and abroad, and published books and essays on the evolution of architectural styles. He theorized about functionalism in Mexico and debated controversial issues of his time, such as the integration of plastic arts into architecture, and promoted the conservation of cities, approaching architecture in a way that could find balance between traditional and modern styles.

Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, \"He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures\" (Natural History, Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the Galatians, were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage. The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander's youthful look. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period, including Laocoo\u0308n and his Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters.

The Scion xD and the second generation xB were first shown to the public on February 8, 2007 at the Chicago Auto Show. The xD appeared in Scion showrooms in mid-2007 in the USA and in 2011 for Canada. The Scion xD was discontinued in 2014, and was succeeded by the Toyota C-HR in 2017. A facelift was designed through late 2010 and patented on 7 January 2011 under design registration number 001845801 - 0004. The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (f sport, uses, lexus enform)\n- (scion xd, shown at, chicago auto show)\n- (lexus enform, includes, shazam tagging)\n- (scion xd, marketed by, toyota)\n- (nissan, known as, datsun)\n- (scion xd, succeeded by, toyota c-hr)\n- (lexus enform, includes, safety connect sos)\n- (datsun 810, introduced by, datsun)\n- (scion xd, unveiled at, geneva motor show)\n- (scion xd, replacing, xa)\n- (scion xd, appeared in, scion showrooms)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. Before the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: Hejaz (Tihamah), Najd (Al - Yamama), Southern Arabia (Hadhramaut) and Eastern Arabia. Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of Yemen and some parts of Saudi Arabia (Najran, Jizan, Asir) and Oman (Dhofar). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area.

Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated.

The Senate's power to establish rules derives from Article One, Section 5 of the United States Constitution: ``Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings... '' The One Hundred Fourteenth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 2015, to January 3, 2017, during the final two full years of Barack Obama's presidency. The 2014 elections gave the Republicans control of the Senate (and control of both houses of Congress) for the first time since the 109th Congress. With 248 seats in the House of Representatives and 54 seats in the Senate, this Congress began with the largest Republican majority since the 71st Congress of 1929 -- 1931. The Republicans regained the majority of the Senate in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015; the Republicans had not controlled the Senate since January 2007. They had needed a net gain of at least six seats to obtain a majority. They held all of their seats, and gained nine Democratic - held seats.

Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror (The Tomb of Dracula), martial arts, (Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu), sword-and-sorcery (Conan the Barbarian, Red Sonja), satire (Howard the Duck) and science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey, \"Killraven\" in Amazing Adventures, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount. Howard the Duck is a 1986 American comic science fiction film directed by Willard Huyck and starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins. Based on the Marvel comic book of the same title, the film was produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz, with George Lucas as executive producer. The screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film, but the film adaptation became live-action because of a contractual obligation.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (marvel, achieved success with, 2001: a space odyssey)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, battlestar galactica)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, star trek)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, conan the barbarian)\n- (marvel, pulled ahead of, dc comics)\n- (howard the duck, stars, lea thompson)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, amazing adventures)\n- (marvel, attempted to diversify, comics code)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, shang-chi: master of kung fu)\n- (howard the duck, is a film directed by, willard huyck)\n- (marvel, published in, curtis magazines)\n- (howard the duck, written by, gloria katz)\n- (howard the duck, stars, jeffrey jones)\n- (howard the duck, produced by, gloria katz)\n- (howard the duck, written by, willard huyck)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, killraven)\n- (goodman, increased the price and size of, marvel)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, red sonja)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, the tomb of dracula)\n- (howard the duck, executive producer, george lucas)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, star wars)\n- (marvel, achieved success with, howard the duck)\n- (howard the duck, stars, tim robbins)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The first year (1914) it went mainstream, the Socialist party had 27 more registered members than the Prohibition Party, who were some members of the Suffrage movement. The Socialist party was similar to the Progressive Party in the county, as it tried from the outskirts of government to make change. While Socialism failed its first year, it still received attention from the press who was aware of the October Revolution (1918) in Russia (Now the Soviet Union) by a similarly named government led by Vladimir Lenin. Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, more commonly referred to locally as the ``West Hills '', pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. Council Crest Park, commonly thought of as the highest point within city limits, is in the West Hills and rises to an elevation of 1,073 feet (327 m) The city's actual high point is a little - known and infrequently accessed point (1,180 feet) near Forest Park. The highest point east of the river is Mt. Tabor, an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to 636 feet (194 m). Nearby Powell Butte and Rocky Butte rise to 614 feet (187 m) and 612 feet (187 m), respectively. To the west of the Tualatin Mountains lies the Oregon Coast Range, and to the east lies the actively volcanic Cascade Range. On clear days, Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens dominate the horizon, while Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier can also be seen in the distance.

Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that the representatives of the Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa. Archaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived in more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang.

Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang. During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by Grazio Braccioli.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.

Buchanan & Press is an American debate show on MSNBC pairing former \"Crossfire\" hosts conservative Pat Buchanan and liberal Bill Press. The show was cancelled due to both hosts opposition to the 2003 Iraq War. MSNBC is an American news cable and satellite television network that provides news coverage and political commentary from NBC News on current events. MSNBC is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of the NBCUniversal Television Group division of NBCUniversal (all of which are ultimately owned by Comcast). MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit, hence the network's naming. Although they had the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington while MSNBC operated out of NBC's headquarters in New York City. Microsoft divested its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012.

It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (\"nurturing mother of studies\"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus, a term used for a university graduate that literally means a \"nursling\" or \"one who is nourished\". Hillcrest High School is a high school located at 3319 N. Grant Avenue in Springfield, Missouri. Hillcrest High School is one of five public high schools in Springfield Public Schools. It is located in the north part of Springfield. It was opened in 1958. As of 2015, there was an enrollment of 1,054 students, making it the smallest of the five public high schools in Springfield. The Alma Mater is a bronze statue by sculptor Lorado Taft, a beloved symbol of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The 10,000-pound statue depicts a mother-figure wearing academic robes and flanked by two attendant figures representing \"Learning\" and \"Labor\", after the University's motto \"Learning and Labor.\" Sited at the corner of Green and Wright Streets at the heart of the campus, the statue is an iconic figure for the university and a popular backdrop for student graduation photos. It is appreciated for its romantic, heraldic overtones and warmth of pose. The statue was removed from its site at the entrance to the university for restoration in 2012 and was returned to its site in the spring of 2014.

Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the ``Long Nine ''for their combined height of 54 feet (16 m).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (senator john c. calhoun, from, south carolina)\n- (abraham lincoln, associated with, long nine)\n- (vandalia, was second state capital of, illinois)\n- (springfield, original name was, calhoun)\n- (calhoun, became county seat of, sangamon county)\n- (calhoun, named after, senator john c. calhoun)\n- (springfield, renamed after, springfield, massachusetts)\n- (springfield, became third capital of, illinois)\n- (springfield, massachusetts, known for, springfield armory)\n- (springfield, massachusetts, comparable to, silicon valley)\n- (kaskaskia, was first capital of, illinois territory)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fla\u0308ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (dessau-ro\u00dflau, is neighboring district of, wittenberg)\n- (martin luther, had polemics against, mary)\n- (mary, is, mother of god)\n- (western schism, eroded loyalty to, catholic church)\n- (martin luther, adhered to, dogmas of the church)\n- (potsdam-mittelmark, is neighboring district of, wittenberg)\n- (martin luther, criticised, catholic church)\n- (mary, is, theotokos)\n- (anhalt-bitterfeld, is neighboring district of, wittenberg)\n- (teltow-fla\u0308ming, is neighboring district of, wittenberg)\n- (protestant reformation, believed in, god)\n- (western schism, eroded loyalty to, pope)\n- (elbe-elster, is neighboring district of, wittenberg)\n- (martin luther, had polemics against, catholic church)\n- (martin luther, criticised, pope)\n- (brandenburg, contains, elbe-elster)\n- (renaissance, impacted, humanism)\n- (martin luther, started, reformation)\n- (nordsachsen, is neighboring district of, wittenberg)\n- (protestant reformation, believed in, jesus)\n- (protestant reformation, relied on, scripture)\n- (reformation, incorporated, protestant reformation)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Vincentas Sladkevic\u030cius, MIC (20 August 1920 \u2013 28 May 2000) was a Lithuanian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (luther, believed in, assumption of mary)\n- (luther, criticized, papists)\n- (mary, was, mother of god)\n- (vincentas sladkevic\u030cius, was a cardinal of, roman catholic church)\n- (luther, preached at, wittenberg)\n- (luther, was adherent of, immaculate conception)\n- (mary, was, theotokos)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. As a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Sainty, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA. Jiangsu Volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in China volleyball league. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435\u20131449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court.

It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Of the 47 AFC member associations, a total of 44 teams entered the competition. The final tournament hosts Thailand decided to participate in qualification despite having automatically qualified for the final tournament.

The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832. There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Cla\u0301sico.

A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus. The original USB 1.0 specification, which was introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5 Mbit/s \"Low Speed\" and 12 Mbit/s \"Full Speed\". Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998.

In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC).

The senior officials in the Office of the Secretary are the Under Secretary of the Air Force, four Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force and the General Counsel, all of whom are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The senior uniformed leadership in the Air Staff is made up of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 2 independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats. Republicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President's party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. This also happened to be the Republicans' largest gain in House seats since 1938.

The heavy Democratic Party losses were attributed to anger with President Obama, opposition to the Affordable Care Act, large budget deficits and the weak economy.

Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fla\u0308ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (anhalt-bitterfeld, located in, brandenburg)\n- (jan hus, attempt to reform, catholic church)\n- (john wycliffe, attempt to reform, catholic church)\n- (nordsachsen, located in, free state of saxony)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporate, god)\n- (martin luther, adhere to, mother of god)\n- (martin luther, oppose, roman curia)\n- (martin luther, oppose, mary)\n- (martin luther, adhere to, theotokos)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporate, jesus)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporate, scripture)\n- (western schism, erode, papacy)\n- (peter waldo, attempt to reform, catholic church)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Jean Hengen (23 November 1912 \u2013 29 January 2005) was a Luxembourgian prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (jean hengen, was prelate of, roman catholic church)\n- (luther, maintained sinlessness of, mary)\n- (luther, understood, assumption of mary)\n- (luther, stopped celebrating, assumption of mary)\n- (luther, believed in, saints)\n- (luther, changed position on, immaculate conception)\n- (luther, considered practice of, roman catholic church)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Written by Grande, Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and Ilya, it was released by Republic Records as the album's lead single on April 20, 2018, alongside its music video. Commercially, the song has topped the charts in Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, and Slovakia and reached the top five in Austria, Canada, Germany, Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. The music video was filmed in early January 2015 and it also stars Matt Bennett, who was also Grande's co-star from the Nickelodeon sitcom Victorious. Max Landis also confirmed that one of the voices of the news reporters in the beginning of the video was actress Elizabeth Gillies, who also co-starred in Victorious with Grande and Bennett. Gillies previously appeared Grande's music video for her single ``Right There ''(2013). Around that time, Max Landis revealed`` One Last Time'' as Grande's next single after tweeting, ``Earth will pass catastrophically through the tail of the comet Eurydice in one week. Gather family and lovers close, one... last... time ''.

He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes wavelength and amplitude.

Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River. The southern border is defined as the 36\u00b0 30\u2032 parallel north, though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes. The border with Tennessee was not settled until 1893, when their dispute was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court. Newport News is included in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. It is at the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, on the northern shore of the James River extending southeast from Skiffe's Creek along many miles of waterfront to the river's mouth at Newport News Point on the harbor of Hampton Roads. The area now known as Newport News was once a part of Warwick County. Warwick County was one of the eight original shires of Virginia, formed by the House of Burgesses in the British Colony of Virginia by order of King Charles I in 1634. The county was largely composed of farms and undeveloped land until almost 250 years later.

It consists of linked stories featuring Timothy Cone, who works as a hard-boiled type investigator. He is a scruffy character, rough of mouth and demeanor but pure of heart. Cone has trouble with relationships, surviving on a rough-edged on-going affair with his supervisor, and an only slightly softer relationship with his cat Cleo. The stories in the book deal with his successful attempts to find out the truth and put villains behind bars. The Anderson Tapes is the debut crime fiction novel by Lawrence Sanders, published in 1970. The story revolves around the complicated burglary of an entire upscale New York apartment building by a gang of ex-convicts, who are unaware that the entire operation is under wiretap and camera surveillance by various agencies. The story also introduces the character of NYPD police detective Edward X. Delaney who became Sander's enduring protagonist in his \"Deadly Sin\" series of novels. The book earned Sanders the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for best first mystery novel.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. A Doi is a village in south-eastern Laos near the border with Vietnam. It is located in Kaleum District in Sekong Province. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years.

The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille. The city centre is around the Binnenalster (\"Inner Alster\") and Au\u00dfenalster (\"Outer Alster\"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The islands of Neuwerk, Scharho\u0308rn, and Nigeho\u0308rn, away in the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park, are also part of the city of Hamburg.

One private CBC affiliate, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, joined E! (then known as CH) on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O&O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and CFJC-TV in Kamloops, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat disaffiliated on August 31, 2008 and joined E!, but the CBC announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, Jim Pattison Group. With the closure of E! and other changes in the media landscape, several former CBC affiliates have since joined City or Global, or closed altogether. Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ckpg-tv, joined, e!)\n- (chat-tv, disaffiliated from, cbc)\n- (chbc-tv, joined, ch)\n- (cbc, purchased by, canwest global)\n- (cfjc-tv, located in, kamloops)\n- (chat-tv, joined, e!)\n- (chat-tv, located in, medicine hat)\n- (ckpg-tv, disaffiliated from, cbc)\n- (cbc, purchased by, chum limited)\n- (cbc, owned and operated, cblt)\n- (ckpg-tv, located in, prince george)\n- (chat-tv, owned by, jim pattison group)\n- (chbc-tv, joined, e!)\n- (cfjc-tv, disaffiliated from, cbc)\n- (cfjc-tv, owned by, jim pattison group)\n- (ckpg-tv, owned by, jim pattison group)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

Maine alone constitutes nearly one - half of the total area of New England, yet is only the 39th - largest state, slightly smaller than Indiana. The remaining states are among the smallest in the U.S., including the smallest state -- Rhode Island. This is a list of the sixteen counties in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster - Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed. The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. The book was originally published in 1985. Set in a near - future New England, in a totalitarian, Christian theonomy that has overthrown the United States government. The novel focuses on the journey of the handmaid Offred.

Zhejiang is mountainous and has therefore fostered the development of many distinct local cultures. Linguistically speaking, Zhejiang is extremely diverse. Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak Wu, but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other varieties of Chinese are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; Mandarin and Huizhou dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while Min dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian.

Richard and a small force of little more than 2,000 men went to Jaffa by sea in a surprise attack. Richard's forces stormed Jaffa from their ships and the Ayyubids, who had been unprepared for a naval attack, were driven from the city. Richard freed those of the Crusader garrison who had been made prisoner, and these troops helped to reinforce the numbers of his army. Saladin's army still had numerical superiority, however, and they counter-attacked. Saladin intended a stealthy surprise attack at dawn, but his forces were discovered; he proceeded with his attack, but his men were lightly armoured and lost 700 men killed due to the missiles of the large numbers of Crusader crossbowmen. The battle to retake Jaffa ended in complete failure for Saladin, who was forced to retreat. This battle greatly strengthened the position of the coastal Crusader states.On 2 September 1192, following his defeat at Jaffa, Saladin was forced to finalize a treaty with Richard providing that Jerusalem would remain under Muslim control, while allowing unarmed Christian pilgrims and traders to visit the city. Ascalon was a contentious issue as it threatened communication between Saladin's dominions in Egypt and Syria; it was eventually agreed that Ascalon, with its defences demolished, be returned to Saladin's control. Richard departed the Holy Land on 9 October 1192. Henry the Young King fought a short war with his brother Richard in 1183 over the status of England, Normandy and Aquitaine. Henry II moved in support of Richard, and Henry the Young King died from dysentery at the end of the campaign.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (richard, freed, crusader garrison)\n- (saladin, finalized a treaty with, richard)\n- (saladin, captured, jaffa)\n- (richard, stormed, jaffa)\n- (henry ii, supported, richard)\n- (richard, intended to return to, england)\n- (henry the young king, fought over, normandy)\n- (henry the young king, fought with, richard)\n- (saladin, retreated from, jaffa)\n- (saladin, controlled, egypt)\n- (henry the young king, fought over, aquitaine)\n- (ascalon, returned to control of, saladin)\n- (henry the young king, fought over, england)\n- (richard, went to, jaffa)\n- (saladin, intended a surprise attack at, jaffa)\n- (saladin, counter-attacked, richard)\n- (ayyubids, were driven from, jaffa)\n- (saladin, controlled, syria)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Microsoft introduced Windows as a graphical user interface for MS - DOS, which had been introduced a couple of years earlier. In the 1990s, the product line evolved from an operating environment into a fully complete, modern operating system over two lines of development, each with their own separate codebase. The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998.

Jason, who was summoned with many others to take part in the sacrifice, lost one of his sandals in the flooded river Anaurus while rushing to Iolcus. In Virgil's Aeneid, Hera had disguised herself as an old woman, whom Jason was helping across the river when he lost his sandal. When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Fearful, Pelias asked Jason what he would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece. Pelias took Jason's advice and sent him to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It would be found at Colchis, in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war. Though the Golden Fleece simply hung on an oak tree, this was a seemingly impossible task, as an ever - watchful dragon guarded it. During Jason's absence, Pelias intended to kill Aeson.

On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements.

With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government.

He searches for food, water, and shelter, and opens the packages, finding a number of useful items. He leaves one package, which has a pair of angel wings stenciled on it, unopened. During a first attempt to make fire, Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. In anger and pain, he throws several objects, including a Wilson volleyball from one of the packages.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ``the predominant feature of Saudi culture '', with its global spread largely financed by the oil and gas trade. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called`` the Land of the Two Holy Mosques'' in reference to Al - Masjid al - Haram (in Mecca) and Al - Masjid an - Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam. As of 2013, the state had a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million were Saudi nationals and 8 million were foreigners. As of 2017, the population is 33 million. The state's official language is Arabic. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen.

In 2007, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates stated that IPTV on Xbox 360 was expected to be available to consumers by the holiday season, using the Microsoft TV IPTV Edition platform. In 2008, Gates and president of Entertainment & Devices Robbie Bach announced a partnership with BT in the United Kingdom, in which the BT Vision advanced TV service, using the newer Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV platform, would be accessible via Xbox 360, planned for the middle of the year. BT Vision's DVR-based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity. In 2010, while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentioned that AT&T's U-verse IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set-top boxes later in the year. As of January 2010, IPTV on Xbox 360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials. The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela hot plugged a USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.\" Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (iptv services, available through, xbox 360)\n- (bt vision, using, microsoft mediaroom iptv platform)\n- (robbie bach, announced partnership with, bt)\n- (bill gates, announced partnership with, bt)\n- (bill gates, highlighting, windows 98)\n- (microsoft, announced, iptv services)\n- (windows 98, demonstrated at, comdex)\n- (steve ballmer, mentioned, at&t's u-verse iptv service)\n- (microsoft, announced at, consumer electronics shows)\n- (bt vision, accessible via, xbox 360)\n- (blue screen of death, became, internet phenomenon)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians. In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations (1948), Stalin published Falsifiers of History, which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left - leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (``Ones of the Majority '') led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (soviets, led by, socialists)\n- (joseph stalin, took power after, vladimir lenin)\n- (armenians, contrasted with, ottoman empire)\n- (bolsheviks, campaigned for, peasants)\n- (falsifiers of history, included claim against, hitler)\n- (bolsheviks, led by, vladimir lenin)\n- (bolsheviks, campaigned for, workers)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road Massacre. Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River. Most PLO fighters withdrew, but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over. The PLO soon resumed its policy of attacks against Israel. In the next few years, the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula.

The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy (s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms -- instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite -- or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit.

Unlike Leo XIII, who addressed the condition of workers, Pius XI discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism, socialism, and totalitarian communism. He also calls for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. The name Vatican city was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city - state. The name is taken from Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state. ``Vatican ''is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden, located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager,`` Vatican territory''. The flag of Vatican City was adopted on June 7, 1929, the year Pope Pius XI signed the Lateran Treaty with Italy, creating a new independent state governed by the Holy See.

The Battle of Atlanta was a battle of the Atlanta Campaign fought during the American Civil War on July 22, 1864, just southeast of Atlanta, Georgia. Continuing their summer campaign to seize the important rail and supply center of Atlanta, Union forces commanded by William Tecumseh Sherman overwhelmed and defeated Confederate forces defending the city under John Bell Hood. Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed during the battle. Despite the implication of finality in its name, the battle occurred midway through the campaign, and the city did not fall until September 2, 1864, after a Union siege and various attempts to seize railroads and supply lines leading to Atlanta. After taking the city, Sherman's troops headed south - southeastward toward Milledgeville, the state capital, and on to Savannah with the March to the Sea.

However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350.

Historically, the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades. However, from its foundation the party has identified itself as anti-socialist. Strong opposition to socialism and communism in Australia and abroad was one of its founding principles. The party's founder and longest-serving leader Robert Menzies envisaged that Australia's middle class would form its main constituency. The UAP had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the Lyons Government went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided Keynesian pump-priming and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941 but resigned as leader of the minority World War II government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 election.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (uap, was led by, billy hughes)\n- (lyons government, pursued, fiscal policy)\n- (liberal party, advocates, economic liberalism)\n- (liberal party, opposes, socialism)\n- (liberal party, has supported, economic protectionism)\n- (lyons government, avoided, keynesian pump-priming)\n- (fiscal policy, included, balanced budgets)\n- (liberal party, opposes, communism)\n- (liberal party, is associated with, new right)\n- (joseph lyons, was a defector from, labor)\n- (robert menzies, envisaged, middle class)\n- (fiscal policy, included, debt reduction)\n- (robert menzies, founded, liberal party)\n- (liberal party, identified itself as, anti-socialist)\n- (uap, disintegrated after, 1943 election)\n- (joseph lyons, was leader of, uap)\n- (liberal party, has supported, interventionism)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia. Because of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, anti-Communist governments. For example, Yugoslavia was the only communist country allowed to have an embassy in Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay. One notable exception to Yugoslavia's neutral stance toward anti-communist countries was Chile under Pinochet; Yugoslavia was one of many countries which severed diplomatic relations with Chile after Salvador Allende was overthrown. Yugoslavia also provided military aid and arms supplies to staunchly anti-Communist regimes such as that of Guatemala under Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garci\u0301a. Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President. Since the Militia Act of 1903 all National Guard soldiers have held dual status: as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and, when activated, as a reserve of the U.S. Army under the authority of the President.

The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in . Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30). In the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia / Kansas City / Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series.

Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito - Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure. For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up - front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the Journal, received a ``chilly ''response from those involved. NFL is a 1989 football video game, developed by Atlus and published by LJN exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.

At its height, the Pinkerton Agency's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army.[citation needed] Because of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, anti-Communist governments. For example, Yugoslavia was the only communist country allowed to have an embassy in Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay. One notable exception to Yugoslavia's neutral stance toward anti-communist countries was Chile under Pinochet; Yugoslavia was one of many countries which severed diplomatic relations with Chile after Salvador Allende was overthrown. Yugoslavia also provided military aid and arms supplies to staunchly anti-Communist regimes such as that of Guatemala under Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garci\u0301a.

The facelift was unveiled at the March 2012 Geneva Motor Show with new wheels, interior colors, new head and tail lamps and new grilles. New LED running lights were introduced as well. The F Sport was introduced, with a honeycomb grille, 8 - speed automatic transmission, and a unique sporty interior. In the US, the new model uses the Lexus Enform telematics system, which includes the Safety Connect SOS system and Shazam tagging. Sales began worldwide in April 2012 for the RX 350 and RX 450h, with sales for the F - Sport variants starting in July of the same year. The Hino Dutro () is a light commercial truck shared with the Toyota Dyna, manufactured by Hino Motors. Like the Dyna and its twin Toyoace, the Dutro is built on the U300 platform for standard cab, or U400 platform for the wide cab and offered in many different chassis type suitable for different purposes. The Dutro took over from the earlier Ranger 2 (and Ranger 3), a badge-engineered version of Daihatsu's Delta series. Outside of Japan, it is also known as the '300 series'. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (facelift, includes, new grilles)\n- (hino dutro, manufactured by, hino motors)\n- (facelift, includes, new head and tail lamps)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, includes, air conditioning)\n- (hino dutro, built on, u400 platform)\n- (f sport, introduced with, honeycomb grille)\n- (facelift, includes, new wheels)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, includes, am-fm radios)\n- (hino dutro, built on, u300 platform)\n- (ranger 2, version of, daihatsu's delta series)\n- (facelift, unveiled at, march 2012 geneva motor show)\n- (hino dutro, took over from, ranger 3)\n- (nissan, introduced, mazda 616)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, includes, central locking)\n- (f sport, introduced with, 8-speed automatic transmission)\n- (facelift, includes, led running lights)\n- (hino dutro, took over from, ranger 2)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, includes, power steering)\n- (hino dutro, known as, 300 series)\n- (facelift, includes, interior colors)\n- (toyota corona mark ii, includes, power windows)\n- (hino dutro, shared with, toyota dyna)\n- (f sport, introduced with, sporty interior)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. As in most of eastern China the ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other minority nationalities. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui nationalities, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533) nationalities. Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435\u20131449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court. Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa:\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (yongle emperor, came out of the palace in, nanjing)\n- (zhuang nationalities, third largest minority group in, nanjing)\n- (manchu nationalities, second largest minority group in, nanjing)\n- (nanjing, ethnic makeup is predominantly, han nationality)\n- (hui nationalities, contributing to minority population in, nanjing)\n- (deshin shekpa, was induced by, ming court)\n- (kublai khan, sit on a lower platform than, sakya phagpa lama)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for the majority of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons \u2013 Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip \u2013 and three daughters \u2013 Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales. Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the abbey. In 1216, Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne, because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral. This coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the abbey on 17 May 1220.

Mercer and Mancini wrote the song for Audrey Hepburn to sing in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's. The lyrics, written by Mercer, are reminiscent of his childhood in Savannah, Georgia, including its waterways. As a child, he had picked huckleberries in summer, and connected them with a carefree childhood and Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.

The area now covered by metropolitan Atlanta was the scene of several fiercely contested battles, including the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, Battle of Ezra Church and the Battle of Jonesboro. On September 1, 1864, Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood evacuated Atlanta, after a five - week siege mounted by Union Gen. William Sherman, and ordered all public buildings and possible Confederate assets destroyed.

The Barclays Center in Brooklyn is home to the Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team. The Nets began playing in Brooklyn in 2012, the first major professional sports team to play in the historic borough in half a century. Before the merger of the defunct American Basketball Association with the NBA during the 1976 -- 1977 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home stadium (Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two - time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward Julius Erving. During the first season of the merger (1976 -- 77), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012 -- 2013 NBA season.

Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The Minikahda Club is a golf club and course located in southwest Minneapolis, Minnesota, just west of Lake Calhoun. The course hosted the U.S. Open in 1916, the U.S. Amateur in 1927, and the Walker Cup in 1957. Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle.

Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.

It is associated with Saint Basil's day, January 1, in most of Greece, but in some regions, the traditions surrounding a cake with a hidden coin are attached to Epiphany or to Christmas. It is made of a variety of dough, depending on regional and family tradition, including tsoureki. In some families, instead of dough, it is made from a custard base called galatopita (literally milk-pita).

But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly larger than the Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3 percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8 percent was Muslim, and 1.9 percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5 percent of the total population is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5 percent, and that 7.7 percent are members of other religious groups. The Armenians collective has, at times, constituted a Christian \"island\" in a mostly Muslim region. There is, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race, while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years. The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States. Later on, the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin, the original seat of the Catholicosate. In 1441, a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi, while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. The area of modern - day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al - Ahsa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines.

Before the merger of the defunct American Basketball Association with the NBA during the 1976 -- 1977 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home stadium (Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two - time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward Julius Erving. During the first season of the merger (1976 -- 77), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654.

Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.

It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits.

Harper led the party through five federal elections: the party increased its seat count in the House of Commons in 2004, formed two minority governments in 2006, and 2008, and then a majority government in 2011. Following the defeat of the party in the 2015 federal election on October 19, Harper tendered his resignation as party leader.

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Ban Kenpha is a village in Houaphanh Province, northeastern Laos. It is to the northeast of Vieng Kham, not far from Muang Xon. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

His mother, named Setareh, was from Bukhara; his father, Abdullah, was a respected Ismaili scholar from Balkh, an important town of the Samanid Empire, in what is today Balkh Province, Afghanistan, although this is not universally agreed upon. His father worked in the government of Samanid in the village Kharmasain, a Sunni regional power. After five years, his younger brother, Mahmoud, was born. Avicenna first began to learn the Quran and literature in such a way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them. Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation.

Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC).

Many aspects of her life and work remain very unclear, especially outside the period 1607 to 1621 from which period dated paintings are known. As Seymour Slive puts it \"Not a single uncontested document has surfaced about her life but there is reason to believe she was active in both Flanders and Holland.\" After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Ce\u0301vennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Loze\u0300re. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200\u20132800 BC.

Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has leverage on shipping through, suez canal)\n- (al saud, emerged as rulers in, najd)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has leverage on shipping through, persian gulf)\n- (al saud, were imbued with the zeal of, wahhabi islamic movement)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese.

It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs.

The term is used in Scholasticism for a \"renowned scholar\", and in biological taxonomy for the scientist describing a species or other taxon. The term is widely replaced by author in English-language works. Charlemagne's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the \"Carolingian Renaissance\". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced.

Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries. Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy. Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as al-Tusi) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as al-Razi) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as al-Ghazali) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means.

The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed. Following shooting of the film, there was a clear flat area at one end of the beach that was created artificially with an odd layout of trees which was never rectified, and the entire area remained damaged from the original state until the tsunami of 2004.

On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (lenin, wrote on, imperialism)\n- (mao zedong, argued, soviet union)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The vast majority of the 322,079 inhabitants are ethnic Russians, but there are also about 13,000 Koryaks (2014). More than half of the population lives in Petropavlovsk - Kamchatsky (179,526 people in 2010) and nearby Yelizovo (38,980). On December 24, Yeltsin informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that by agreement of the member states of the CIS Russian Federation would assume the membership of the Soviet Union in all UN organs (including permanent membership in the UN Security Council). Thus, Russia is considered to be an original member of the UN (since October 24, 1945) along with Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR) and Belarus (Byelorussian SSR). On December 25\u2014just hours after Gorbachev resigned as president of the Soviet Union\u2014the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation (Russia), reflecting that it was now a sovereign state with Yeltsin assuming the Presidency. The change was originally published on January 6, 1992 (Rossiyskaya Gazeta). According to law, during 1992, it was allowed to use the old name of the RSFSR for official business (forms, seals and stamps).

Gradually their privileges were under further limitations to be completely dissolved by March Constitution of Poland in 1921. Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line.

The New York Red Bulls play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey. Historically, the city is known for the New York Cosmos, the highly successful former professional soccer team which was the American home of Pele\u0301, one of the world's most famous soccer players. A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene.

Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries accompanying the Orlams were well received by them, the right to use waterholes and grazing was granted against an annual payment.

Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa: During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

The label's country division MCA Nashville is a still active imprint of Universal Music Group Nashville. MCA Records picked up the reissue rights for \"Con-Test\", as well as Nash's \"American Band-ages\" in 1986, but the abrupt change in record labels led to a near-absence of promotion for both records. Santa Monica was long inhabited by the Tongva people. Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portola\u0300, who camped near the present day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769. There are two different versions of the naming of the city. One says that it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is actually May 4.

The album was released on November 15, 2010. While most artists became established in other formats before moving to adult contemporary, Michael Buble\u0301 and Josh Groban started out as AC artists. Throughout this decade, artists such as Nick Lachey, James Blunt, John Mayer, Bruno Mars, Jason Mraz, Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Clay Aiken and Susan Boyle have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.

The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.Shiraz's economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice.

His most noted work was a statue of Tyche, which he made for the city of Antioch, then newly founded. The goddess, who embodied the idea of the city, was seated on a rock, crowned with towers, and having the river Orontes at her feet. There is a small copy of the statue in the Vatican. It was imitated by a number of Asiatic cities; and indeed most statues since created that commemorate cities borrow something from the work of Eutychides. In Greek mythology, Sicyon (; ) is the eponym of the polis of the same name, which was said to have previously been known as Aegiale and, earlier, Mecone. His father is named variously as Marathon, Metion, Erechtheus or Pelops. Sicyon married Zeuxippe, the daughter of Lamedon, the previous king of the polis and region that would come to be named after him. They had a daughter Chthonophyle, who bore two sons: Polybus to Hermes and, later, Androdamas to Phlius, the son of Dionysus.

La fida ninfa (\"The Faithful Nymph\") is an opera by Antonio Vivaldi to a libretto by Scipione Maffei. The opera was first performed for the opening of the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona on 6 January 1732. Among the arias is \"Alma oppressa de sorte crudele\" (\"Soul oppressed by cruel fate\"). Orlando furioso RV 819 (, Teatro San Angelo, Venice 1714) is a three-act opera surviving in manuscript in Antonio Vivaldi's personal library, only partly related to his better known Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727. It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819.

It is part of the City University of New York. Ernest Glenn McClain (August 6, 1918 Massillon, Ohio - April 25, 2014 Washington, DC) was professor emeritus of music at Brooklyn College. McClain is known for his efforts to establish the ancient mathematical discipline of music as the means to unlock the deepest meaning of history's great religious and philosophical texts. His writings offer a musical-mathematical explanation of crucial passages in texts of world literature, including the Bible, the Rig Veda, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and Plato. All of these passages deal with numbers that he claimed had either been ignored or misinterpreted throughout the centuries. McClain's explanation is based on the meanings of these numbers within the context of the quadrivium, the four ancient mathematical disciplines of arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. His discovery of identical or similar numbers and parallel mathematical constructs in Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, Palestine and Greece, suggests the historical continuity of a common spiritual tradition linking the microcosm of the soul to the macrocosm of the universe. His work provides much of the missing mathematical detail for what scholars often call the Music of the Spheres.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, explained, quadrivium)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, died in, washington, dc)\n- (brooklyn college, is in, new york city)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, discovered numbers in, egypt)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, discovered numbers in, palestine)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, wrote about, bible)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, was born in, massillon, ohio)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, discovered numbers in, babylon)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, discovered numbers in, sumer)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, discovered numbers in, greece)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, wrote about, rig veda)\n- (quadrivium, includes, arithmetic)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, wrote about, plato)\n- (quadrivium, includes, geometry)\n- (brooklyn college, is part of, city university of new york)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, wrote about, egyptian book of the dead)\n- (quadrivium, includes, astronomy)\n- (quadrivium, includes, music)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, was professor emeritus of music at, brooklyn college)\n- (ernest glenn mcclain, contributed to, music of the spheres)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics.

He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (sola fide, obtain, god's pardon for sin)\n- (luther, considered, roman catholic practice)\n- (luther, insisting that, purgatory)\n- (roman catholic practice, include, saints' days)\n- (luther, criticising, indulgences)\n- (luther, linked to, christocentric theology)\n- (roman catholic practice, include, intercessory requests)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporate, sola scriptura)\n- (luther, insisting that, catholic doctrine)\n- (protestant reformation, incorporate, sola fide)\n- (martin luther, started, ninety-five theses)\n- (luther, insisting that, pope)\n- (luther, criticize, papists)\n- (catholic doctrine, include, merits of the saints)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

As for its predecessor, it has a ladder frame with leaf sprung front and rear axles. The Toyopet Master was an evolution of an earlier Toyota sedan called the Toyota SF/RH model (also known as the Super), and was sold in parallel with the first Toyota Crown. The more conservative Master was introduced as a frugally equipped version meant for taxi usage. The Master and Crown shared the same R-series engine, which produces in the Master. It was sold at a chain of Toyota Japan dealerships called \"Toyota Store\", next to the more upscale Crown, which was intended as a private purchase alternative to the Master. The Acura Legend is a mid-size luxury/executive car manufactured by Honda. It was sold in the U.S., Canada, and parts of China under Honda's luxury brand, Acura, from 1985 to 1995, as both a sedan, which was classified as a full-size car, and a coupe, which was classified as a mid-size car (similar to how the Honda Accord is set up today). It was the first flagship sedan sold under the Acura nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the Acura 3.5RL. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (acura 3.5rl, is the north american version of, ka9 series honda legend)\n- (toyota crown, was sold at, toyota store)\n- (acura legend, was sold in, u.s.)\n- (toyopet master, was an evolution of, toyota sf/rh model)\n- (toyopet master, is an update to, sf/rh model)\n- (toyota, introduced larger cars such as, toyota corona mark ii)\n- (acura legend, was sold in, china)\n- (toyopet master, was sold at, toyota store)\n- (toyota crown, was intended as a private purchase alternative to, toyopet master)\n- (acura legend, was sold in, canada)\n- (toyopet master, has, r-series engine)\n- (acura legend, was sold under, acura)\n- (acura legend, is manufactured by, honda)\n- (acura legend, was renamed as, acura 3.5rl)\n- (nissan, introduced larger cars such as, mazda 616)\n- (toyota sf/rh model, is also known as, super)\n- (toyopet master, shared the same engine with, toyota crown)\n- (toyopet master, was sold in parallel with, toyota crown)\n- (toyota, introduced larger cars such as, toyota cressida)\n- (datsun, introduced larger cars such as, datsun 810)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (\u738b\u6f6e) and Wang Shenzhi (\u738b\u5be9\u77e5), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou. These two waves of migrations from the north generally brought the language of northern Middle Chinese into the Fujian region. This then gradually evolved into the Zhangzhou dialect. The Manchus sent Han Bannermen to fight against Koxinga's Ming loyalists in Fujian. The Qing carried out a massive depopulation policy and seaban forcing people to evacuated the coast in order to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources, this has led to a myth that it was because Manchus were \"afraid of water\". In Fujian, it was Han Bannermen who were the ones carrying out the fighting and killing for the Qing and this disproved the entirely irrelevant claim that alleged fear of the water on part of the Manchus had to do with the coastal evacuation and seaban. Even though a poem refers to the soldiers carrying out massacres in Fujian as \"barbarian\", both Han Green Standard Army and Han Bannermen were involved in the fighting for the Qing side and carried out the worst slaughter. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (emperor xizong of tang, reigned during, wang chao)\n- (han bannermen, fought against, koxinga)\n- (wang chao, led military expedition to pacify, huang chao)\n- (green standard army, involved in fighting for, qing)\n- (manchus, sent, han bannermen)\n- (bannermen, used against, three feudatories)\n- (green standard army, used against, three feudatories)\n- (han bannermen, carried out killing for, qing)\n- (han bannermen, carried out fighting for, qing)\n- (chen zheng, brought phonology into, zhangzhou)\n- (wang chao, brought phonology into, zhangzhou)\n- (wang shenzhi, brought phonology into, zhangzhou)\n- (green standard army, carried out slaughter for, qing)\n- (emperor gaozong, reigned during, chen zheng)\n- (han bannermen, fought against, ming loyalists)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It was shot in black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; \"Suga Mama\" was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to \"slowly become a woman\" during the video, adding \"Well, a sexier woman \u2013 I'm always a woman.\"Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around.

His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: John Kodwo Amissah (November 27, 1922 \u2013 September 22, 1991) was a Ghanaian prelate of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Cape Coast from 1959 until his death. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.

On 27 August 2007, Royal Dutch Shell and Reitan Group, the owner of the 7-Eleven brand in Scandinavia, announced an agreement to re-brand some 269 service stations across Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, subject to obtaining regulatory approvals under the different competition laws in each country. On April 2010 Shell announced that the corporation is in process of trying to find a potential buyer for all of its operations in Finland and is doing similar market research concerning Swedish operations. On October 2010 Shell's gas stations and the heavy vehicle fuel supply networks in Finland and Sweden, along with a refinery located in Gothenburg, Sweden were sold to St1, a Finnish energy company, more precisely to its major shareholding parent company Keele Oy. Shell branded gas stations will be rebranded within maximum of five years from the acquisition and the number of gas stations is likely to be reduced. Until then the stations will operate under Shell brand licence.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (shell, sold refinery located in, gothenburg)\n- (houston, located in, texas)\n- (marion king hubbert, contributed to, hubbert peak theory)\n- (reitan group, owner of, 7-eleven)\n- (gothenburg, located in, sweden)\n- (st1, parent company is, keele oy)\n- (marion king hubbert, worked at, shell research lab)\n- (marion king hubbert, contributed to, hubbert curve)\n- (royal dutch shell, sold operations to, st1)\n- (7-eleven, located in, scandinavia)\n- (shell research lab, located in, houston)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. Xexyz (pronounced zeks'-zees/zeks'-iz), known in Japan as , is a 1988 video game published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released in Japan on August 26, 1988, and saw a North American release sometime in April, 1990. The game was never released in Europe and the game is not playable on PAL consoles.

The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel (with a faculty of medicine) and has a tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. The biggest university in Switzerland is the University of Zurich with nearly 25,000 students. The two institutes sponsored by the federal government are the ETHZ in Zu\u0308rich (founded 1855) and the EPFL in Lausanne (founded 1969 as such, formerly an institute associated with the University of Lausanne) which both have an excellent international reputation.[note 10] Andre\u0301 S.

He finished his high school studies in Zu\u0308rich and then studied at Columbia University in New York where he was awarded BS and MS degrees. After two years as research assistant at Hoffmann-La Roche, he continued postgraduate studies at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under professor Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1947. He remained at the university until 1949 as Rackham and Lloyd Postdoctoral Fellow. From 1949 to 1954, Dreiding was assistant professor at Wayne University, Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. He also temporarily took over Bachmann's teaching and research duties at the University of Michigan after Bachmann's death in 1951, and held them until 1952.
