He wrote fundamental works in applied celestial mechanics, spaceflight dynamics and robotics. On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (dmitry yevgenyevich okhotsimsky, has_program, pioneer of space ballistics in ussr program)\n- (pioneer of space ballistics in ussr program, has_amount, fundamental works in applied celestial mechanics)\n- (pioneer of space ballistics in ussr program, has_amount, fundamental works in spaceflight dynamics)\n- (pioneer of space ballistics in ussr program, has_amount, fundamental works in robotics)\n- (president truman, dispatched, united states seventh fleet)\n- (united states seventh fleet, targets, prevention of hostilities between nationalist republic of china and people's republic of china)\n- (mao zedong, reported_to_politburo, intervention in korea after prc invasion of taiwan aborted)\n- (prc invasion of taiwan, aborted_on, 4 august 1950)\n- (trotsky, believed, revolution could only succeed as part of a world revolution)\n- (lenin, wrote, imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism)\n- (joseph stalin, established, socialism in one country for soviet ussr)\n- (socialism in one country for soviet ussr, purged, early internationalist elements)\n- (early internationalist elements, abandoned_until, client state during cold war)\n- (client state during cold war, started_new_wave_of, anti-imperialist propaganda)\n- (nikita khrushchev, put_pressure_on, soviet-american relations)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade.

John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.

This led to a separate inquiry into BCCI, and as a result, banking regulators shut down BCCI in 1991. In December 1992, Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado, released The BCCI Affair, a report on the BCCI scandal. The report showed that the bank was crooked and was working with terrorists, including Abu Nidal. It blasted the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, the Customs Service, the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as influential lobbyists and the CIA. The word Hindu is derived from the Indo - Aryan and Sanskrit word Sindhu, which means ``a large body of water '', covering`` river, ocean''. It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama.

Dean, despite having withdrawn from the race two weeks earlier, won his home state of Vermont. Edwards finished only slightly behind Kerry in Georgia, but, failing to win a single state other than South Carolina, chose to withdraw from the presidential race. Sharpton followed suit a couple weeks later. Kuninch did not leave the race officially until July. In the early years, many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston, South Carolina. In 1685, Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France, was among the first to settle there. He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city. After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent, including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne, Jean Postell of Dieppe France, Alexander Pepin, Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France, and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble, immigrated to the Charleston Orange district. They were very successful at marriage and property speculation. After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies, they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper, Ashepoo, Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger.

He made significant career progress through the court of King Vajiravudh, but left government office to work privately as the country was going through political change which abolished absolute monarchy and decreased government employment of foreigners. However, by adopting a Thai identity and way of life, marrying a Thai woman and settling down permanently, Manfredi remained a relevant and respected figure in Thai architecture, and later became a lecturer at Chulalongkorn University. His works include various royal residences and public institutions, ranging in style from Venetian Gothic to modernist, and incorporated Thai traditional styles as well. He contributed to much of Bangkok's architectural heritage, but no complete records of his works were kept. Controversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Leh to make it more ``paradise - like ''.

The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. In 1963 Flexer moved to Canada settling in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he became involved in the anti-war movement protesting the Vietnam War and participated in the celebrated removal of Dow Chemical from the U of M campus. In 1968 he moved to Montreal. Following a brief stay in Israel in 1970, where he lived and worked on kibbutz Gan-Shmuel, he moved back to Canada and settled in Toronto in 1970. There he joined the Waffle, a radical socialist tendency within the New Democratic Party, becoming its provincial organizer in Ontario. Moving leftward, he helped form the Red Circle, a Marxist tendency within the Waffle. When the Waffle was forced out of the NDP in 1972, Flexer and the Red Circle split with the Waffle, opposing its decision to leave the NDP, and tried to continue Marxist activities within the NDP. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal.

(also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Sunman is an unreleased action video game developed by EIM and planned to be published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Despite being mostly complete, it was never commercially released. During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system\u2014the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's \"Ultra Games\" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (nintendo, developed, nes)\n- (nintendo, manufactured, nes)\n- (nes, initially_released_as, famicom in japan during unspecified time)\n- (nes, abbreviated_as, fc)\n- (nes, released_in_north_america_during, 1985)\n- (nes, released_in_europe_during, 1986)\n- (nes, released_in_australia_in, 1987)\n- (eim, developed, sunman)\n- (sunsoft, planned_to_publish, sunman for nes in 1992)\n- (sega's console, competed_with_nes, leading to changes in nintendo\u2019s policies towards third-party developers)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (myanmar, borders, china)\n- (myanmar, borders, india)\n- (myanmar, borders, bangladesh)\n- (myanmar, borders, thailand)\n- (myanmar, borders, laos)\n- (myanmar, is_located_near, major indian ocean shipping lanes)\n- (toungoo dynasty, regrouped_and_defeated, portuguese)\n- (1613, regrouped_and_defeated_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (toungoo dynasty, regrouped_and_defeated, siam)\n- (1614, regrouped_and_defeated_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (a smaller, more manageable kingdom, restored by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (lower myanmar, encompassed_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (upper myanmar, encompassed_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (shan states, encompassed_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (lan na, encompassed_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (upper tenasserim, encompassed_by, toungoo dynasty)\n- (khong island, is_largest_island_of, si phan don riverine archipelago)\n- (si phan don riverine archipelago, seat_of_administration_in, mekong river)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In 1929, the enterprise was first founded as American Record Corporation (ARC) and, in 1938, was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation, following ARC's acquisition by CBS. In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. In 1987, Sony Corporation of Japan bought the company, and in 1991, renamed it SME. It is the world's second largest recorded music company, after Universal Music Group. Santa Monica has a bike action plan and recently launched a Bicycle sharing system in November 2015. The city is traversed by the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. Santa Monica has received the Bicycle Friendly Community Award (Bronze in 2009, Silver in 2013) by the League of American Bicyclists. Local bicycle advocacy organizations include Santa Monica Spoke, a local chapter of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition.

Through his presidential candidacies as well as his work with labor movements, Debs eventually became one of the best-known socialists living in the United States. Roosevelt had served as president from 1901 to 1909, and Taft had won the 1908 Republican president nomination with Roosevelt's support. Displeased with Taft's actions as president, Roosevelt challenged Taft at the 1912 Republican National Convention. After Taft and his conservative allies narrowly prevailed at the Republican convention, Roosevelt rallied his progressive supporters and launched a third party bid. With the support of William Jennings Bryan and other progressives, Wilson won the Democratic Party's presidential nomination on the 46th ballot.

In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In neighborhoods such as Riverdale (in the Bronx), Ditmas Park (in Brooklyn), and Douglaston (in Queens), large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian. The Bronx /\u02c8br\u0252\u014bks/ is the northernmost of the five boroughs (counties) of New York City in the state of New York, located south of Westchester County. Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River, as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and, with a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014, has the fourth largest land area, the fourth highest population, and the third-highest population density.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (new york's large residential districts, has_character, defined by elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses)\n- (new york's large residential districts, has_character, includes shabby tenements)\n- (elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses, are_types_of_housing_in, new york's large residential districts)\n- (shabby tenements, are_types_of_housing_in, new york's large residential districts)\n- (1870 to 1930, is_period_of_rapid_expansion_for, new york's large residential districts)\n- (rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930, includes_development_of_architectural_styles_in, riverdale)\n- (rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930, includes_development_of_architectural_styles_in, ditmas park)\n- (rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930, includes_development_of_architectural_styles_in, douglaston)\n- (riverdale, has_architectural_style, tudor revival)\n- (ditmas park, has_architectural_style, victorian)\n- (douglaston, has_architectural_style, tudor revival and victorian)\n- (new york's large residential districts, includes_neighborhoods, riverdale)\n- (new york's large residential districts, includes_neighborhoods, ditmas park)\n- (new york's large residential districts, includes_neighborhoods, douglaston)\n- (riverdale, is_a, neighborhood in, new york's large residential districts)\n- (ditmas park, is_a, neighborhood in, new york's large residential districts)\n- (douglaston, is_a, neighborhood in, new york's large residential districts)\n- (new york's large residential districts, has_character, defined by free-standing dwellings)\n- (free-standing dwellings, are_types_of_housing_in, new york's large residential districts)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The bridge opened in 1967 and was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. It had a catastrophic failure during the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely cause of the collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and additional weight on the bridge at the time contributed to the catastrophic failure. Minneapolis is a city in and the county seat of Ottawa County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,032. The Merchants Bridge, officially the Merchants Memorial Mississippi Rail Bridge, is a rail bridge crossing the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and Venice, Illinois. The bridge is owned by the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.

Some, such as the United Kingdom and Prussia (as the founder of the newly formed German state), experienced continued economic growth and political power. Others, such as Russia and Austria-Hungary, stagnated. At the same time, other states were emerging and expanding in power, largely through the process of industrialization. These countries seeking to attain great power status were: Italy after the Risorgimento, Japan after the Meiji Restoration, and the United States after its civil war. By the dawn of the 20th century, the balance of world power had changed substantially since the Congress of Vienna. The Eight-Nation Alliance was a belligerent alliance of eight nations against the Boxer Rebellion in China. It formed in 1900 and consisted of the five Congress powers plus Italy, Japan, and the United States, representing the great powers at the beginning of 20th century. The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts. Large hotels were built during the Belle E\u0301poque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger. During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (united kingdom, supports, balance of power)\n- (uk program for economic growth, targets, balance of power)\n- (prussia, includes, newly formed german state)\n- (prussian program for economic growth, founder, prussia)\n- (russia, stagnation, contrasts with other nations' growth)\n- (austria-hungary, stagnation, parallels russia's situation)\n- (italy, seeks, great power status)\n- (italian risorgimento, aims, great power status)\n- (japan, meiji restoration, aims, great power status)\n- (us, civil war, aims, great power status)\n- (congress of vienna program, created, balance of power system)\n- (vienna program changes, by, dawn of 20th century)\n- (eight-nation alliance, formed, to address boxer rebellion in 1900)\n- (alliance formation, reflects, shifts in global power dynamics)\n- (tourism industry, begins, early 19th century with travelers visiting alps)\n- (austrian program for tourism, supports, scenic views and spa-resorts)\n- (belle epoque hotels, built, during early 20th century to cater tourists)\n- (early 20th century hotels, target, tourists traveling higher elevations)\n- (jungfraubahn tunnel construction, supports, infrastructure development for tourism)\n- (jungfraubahn program, targets, supporting tourism in alps)\n- (downhill skiing, becomes popular, among english visitors during winter sports evolution)\n- (ski-lift installation above grindelwald, exemplifies, evolution of winter sports facilities)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth. Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Historically, Heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention -- possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (planetary geologists, measure_isotope_ratios, oxygen isotopes)\n- (oxygen isotopes, measured_by, planetary geologists)\n- (samples, include, earth samples)\n- (samples, include, moon samples)\n- (samples, include, mars samples)\n- (samples, include, meteorite samples)\n- (reference values, unavailable_for, isotope ratios (sun))\n- (isotope ratios, in_sun, reference values unavailable)\n- (sun, has_more_oxygen_16, earth)\n- (measurement, indicates_depletion_of, oxygen-16 in sun\u2019s proplanetary material)\n- (depletion, happened_before, dust grains formed earth)\n- (heliocentrism, describes_planets_revolution_around, sun (earth))\n- (solar system center, is_sun, heliocentrism)\n- (historically, heliocentrism_and_geocentrism_are_opposed, geocentrism places earth at center)\n- (geocentrism, places_earth_at_center, earth)\n- (according to heliocentrism, earth_revolves_around, sun)\n- (aristarchus of samos proposed heliocentrism in 3rd century bc, heliocentrism, proposed by aristarchus of samos)\n- (aristarchus\u2019s heliocentrism received little medieval attention, attention, received little from aristarchus\u2019s heliocentrism)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. Shiraz is the economic center of southern Iran. The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.Shiraz's economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice.

Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities. Despite cost of living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities. The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the United States at that time, providing services denied to them by the existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the boston globe, acquired_by, the new york times)\n- (the boston globe, has_program, context gentrification program in boston)\n- (context gentrification program in boston, targets, housing prices)\n- (housing prices, increases_with, sharp increase since 1990s in boston)\n- (housing prices, affects, living expenses)\n- (living expenses, ranked_in, quality of living survey (2011))\n- (quality of living survey (2011), ranking, 129th out of 214 cities)\n- (bank of america, founded_in, october 17, 1904 in san francisco)\n- (bank of america, has_program, amadeo pietro giannini founding program)\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, founded, bank of italy)\n- (bank of italy, served, immigrants (settling in the u.s.))\n- (american banks, discriminated_against, immigrants)\n- (american banks, provided_services_to, wealthiest)\n- (gentrification, occurred_in, boston since latter half of 20th century)\n- (fleetboston financial, merged_with, bank of america)\n- (bank of america, has_program, fleetboston financial merger program in 2004)\n- (fleetboston financial, merged_into, bank of america (2004))\n- (jordan marsh department store, merged_into, macy's)\n- (filene's department store, merged_into, macy's)\n- (macy's, acquired, jordan marsh department store)\n- (macy's, acquired, filene's department store)\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, raised_by, mother and lorenzo scatena (stepfather))\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, father_shot_in, pay dispute with employee during 1906 san francisco earthquake)\n- (bank of italy, affected_by, 1906 san francisco earthquake)\n- (san francisco banks, unable_to_open_vaults, due to 1906 earthquake)\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, used_rescued_funds_to, lend within days after 1906 disaster)\n- (amadeo pietro giannini, worked_from, desk made of planks over two barrels)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Due to financial difficulties reported by the corporation, the corporation published digital transition plans for none of its analogue retransmitters in mandatory markets to be converted to digital by the deadline. Under this plan, communities that receive analogue signals by rebroadcast transmitters in mandatory markets would lose their over-the-air signals as of the deadline. Rebroadcast transmitters account for 23 of the 48 CBC and Radio-Canada transmitters in mandatory markets.

In both of those markets, the corporation's television transmitters are the only ones that were not planned to be converted to digital by the deadline. Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP).

It sold at auction in 2002 for C$5.1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at that time. It was purchased by media magnate Ken Thomson, who donated it to the Art Gallery of Ontario. The painting depicts British explorer John Henry Lefroy on his successful expedition to map the Magnetic North Pole. A largely self-educated artist, Paul Kane grew up in Toronto (then known as York) and trained himself by copying European masters on a \"Grand Tour\" study trip through Europe. He undertook two voyages through the Canadian northwest in 1845 and from 1846 to 1848. The first trip took him from Toronto to Sault Ste. Marie and back. Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria. The Toronto Coach Terminal is the central bus station for inter-city services in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at 610 Bay Street, in the city's Downtown.

The TTC managed the station directly until July 8, 2012, when it was leased out in its entirety to bus lines Coach Canada and Greyhound Canada for $1.2 million annually.

Like adjacent Upper Lusatia in the south, Lower Lusatia is a settlement area of the West Slavic Sorbs whose endangered Lower Sorbian language is related to Upper Sorbian and Polish. In the early 5th century, the deep crisis suffered by the Roman Empire allowed different tribes of Central Europe (Suebi, Vandals and Alani) to cross the Rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 December 406. Its progress towards the Iberian Peninsula forced the Roman authorities to establish a treaty (foedus) by which the Suebi would settle peacefully and govern Galicia as imperial allies. So, from 409 Galicia was taken by the Suebi, forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in Europe, in 411, even before the fall of the Roman Empire, being also the first Germanic kingdom to mint coinage in Roman lands. During this period a Briton colony and bishopric (see Mailoc) was established in Northern Galicia (Britonia), probably as foederati and allies of the Suebi. In 585, the Visigothic King Leovigild invaded the Suebic kingdom of Galicia and defeated it, bringing it under Visigoth control.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (lower lusatia, supports, west slavic sorbs settlement)\n- (west slavic sorbs, has_language, lower sorbian language)\n- (west slavic sorbs, related_to, upper sorbian language)\n- (west slavic sorbs, related_to, polish language)\n- (suebi tribe, uses, rhine river for crossing in 406 ad)\n- (suebi tribe, settles_in, galicia)\n- (galicia, includes, northern galicia region)\n- (roman empire, in_crisis, 406 ad)\n- (suebi tribe, requires, foedus treaty with roman empire)\n- (foedus treaty, requires, suebi settlement in galicia)\n- (leovigild, king_of_visigoth, reigns in 585 ad)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. David Htan (; born 13 May 1990) is a burmese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Myanmar national football team and Shan United.

Apple's market share further struggled due to the release of the Windows 95 operating system, which unified Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products. Windows 95 significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of IBM PC compatible computers, and brought the capabilities of Windows to parity with the Mac OS GUI. From 1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq, Gateway, IBM, Packard Bell, and AST Research struggled and eventually left the market or were bought out. Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at Cisco. In 2002, when Compaq merged with Hewlett Packard (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government.

The three major American broadcast networks are all headquartered in New York: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Many cable networks are based in the city as well, including MTV, Fox News, HBO, Showtime, Bravo, Food Network, AMC, and Comedy Central. The City of New York operates a public broadcast service, NYCTV, that has produced several original Emmy Award-winning shows covering music and culture in city neighborhoods and city government. The Cube is an hour-long teleplay that aired on NBC's weekly anthology television show \"NBC Experiment in Television\" in 1969. The production was produced and directed by puppeteer and filmmaker Jim Henson, and was one of several experiments with the live-action film medium which he conducted in the 1960s, before focusing entirely on \"The Muppets\" and other puppet works. The screenplay was co-written by long-time Muppet writer Jerry Juhl. Celebrity Big Brother also known as Big Brother: Celebrity Edition is a spin - off series of the American reality television series Big Brother. This season will air during the winter of the 2017 -- 18 network television season on CBS and will be the second U.S. Big Brother season to air outside the usual summer television season, the first being Big Brother 9 in 2008. Julie Chen will return as host, with Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan returning as executive producers. The season will be produced by Fly on the Wall Entertainment in association with Endemol Shine North America.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, polemicizes_with, roman catholic opponents)\n- (roman catholic opponents, concerns, mary)\n- (roman catholic opponents, concerns, saints)\n- (ecumenical councils, issues, marian decrees)\n- (dogmas of the church, includes, marian decrees)\n- (luther, adheres_to, marian decrees from ecumenical councils)\n- (luther, adheres_to, dogmas of the church)\n- (luther, believes_in, perpetual virginity)\n- (luther, believes_in, theotokos)\n- (immaculate conception, predates, luther's belief)\n- (pope pius ix, declares, immaculate conception)\n- (1854, year_of_declaration, immaculate conception)\n- (luther, maintains_sinlessness_of_mary, throughout life)\n- (church dogmas, undefined_in_luther's_time, immaculate conception)\n- (bible, basis_for_rejection, assumption of mary)\n- (luther, reveres, mary)\n- (papists, criticized_by_luther, for blurring line between admiration and service)\n- (saints' days, worship_practices, venerated by papists)\n- (intercessory requests, addressed_to_saints, idolatrous in luther's view)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fla\u0308ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (he, considers, roman catholic practices as idolatry)\n- (roman catholic practices, includes, criticism of sale of indulgences)\n- (luther, preaches, sermon at wittenberg)\n- (sermon preached at wittenberg, targets, criticism of sale of indulgences)\n- (pope, has_authority_over, purgatory according to traditional thought)\n- (catholic doctrine of saints' merits, lacks_foundation_in, bible according to luther's critique)\n- (luther, critiques, catholic practices including authority over purgatory and doctrine of saints' merits)\n- (protestant reformation, relies_on, scripture as source of belief)\n- (reliance on scripture, is_the_only_way_to_obtain, god's pardon for sin through faith in jesus)\n- (theological motivation, motivates, protestant reformation)\n- (nationalism, influences, motivations behind protestant reformation)\n- (western schism, erodes, loyalty to the papacy)\n- (perceived corruption of roman curia, influences, views on papacy due to western schism)\n- (humanism and renaissance, questions, traditional thought)\n- (wittenberg, is_a_district_in, saxony-anhalt, germany)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the abbey. In 1216, Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne, because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral. This coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the abbey on 17 May 1220.

Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

The commission was officially created to investigate acts of violence that occurred around the independence referendum held in East Timor in 1999 and sought to find the \"conclusive truth\" behind the events. After holding private hearings and document reviews, the commission handed in the final report on July 15, 2008 to the presidents of both nations, and was fully endorsed by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, providing the first acknowledgement by the government of Indonesia of the human rights violations committed by state institutions in Timor.

The station's main format is classic country targeted towards Springfield, and their transmitter - and former studios - are also located in Springfield. Jackson Township is one of eleven townships in Randolph County, Indiana, United States. As of the 2010 census, its population was 619 and it contained 250 housing units. Owing to its role in the state's history, the county motto is \"Where Illinois Began.\" It contains the historically important village of Kaskaskia, Illinois's first capital. Springfield's original name was Calhoun, after Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city.

Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households. The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top. As a result, the mean tends to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. Aaron Spelling (April 22, 1923 \u2013 June 23, 2006) was an American film and television producer.

He also served as producer of Mod Squad (1968-1973), The Rookies (1972-1976), and Sunset Beach (1997-1999). This was one of the few failures from Aaron Spelling's production company in its history, since it was picked by ABC to debut right after the Super Bowl in 1985 and was heavily promoted during the game.

It was destroyed in 1828 by the Thais, who burned and pillaged Vientiane following the defeat of the last king of the Vientiane dynasty of Lan Xang, Chao Anouvong. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Myanmar (also known as Burma) is the northwestern-most country of mainland Southeast Asia, bordering China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos. It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs.

The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. Swiss are fans of football and the national team is nicknamed the 'Nati'.

Records. After both the album and its singles failed to chart in the United States (although \"I Will (Take You Forever)\" did chart in several other countries) and due in large part to the general decline in sales beginning with \"Another Page\" (1983), Cross was soon released from Warner Bros. \"Swept Away\" was previously heard on a few episodes of the TV show \"Growing Pains\" in 1987. It would be nearly five years until Cross signed a new recording contract with BMG and release a new album, \"Rendezvous\", in 1993. \"Think of Laura\" is a popular song by the American Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Christopher Cross. Released as a single in late 1983 from Cross' second studio album, \"Another Page\", \"Think of Laura\" became the singer's fourth (and, to date, final) single to reach the Top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, where it peaked at #9 in early 1984. The song spent eleven weeks in the Top 40. In addition, the song became Cross' third single to hit #1 on the adult contemporary chart, following \"Never Be the Same\" and \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\". \"Think of Laura\" remained at #1 on this chart for four weeks.

From 1928 until 1965, this was also home to the state's male death row. The first executions on the electric chair were on February 8, 1924, when Charles Reynolds, Ewell Morris, George Washington, Mack Matthews, and Melvin Johnson had their death sentences carried out. The five executions were the most carried out on a single day in the state. The state would conduct multiple executions on a single day on several other occasions, the last being on August 9, 2000. Since then, the state has not executed more than one person on a single day, though there is no law prohibiting it. A total of 361 people were electrocuted in Texas, with the last being Joseph Johnson on July 30, 1964.

Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973\u20131048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981\u20131037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt. One of the common definitions for \"Islamic philosophy\" is \"the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.\" Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims.

Macbeth (/ m\u0259k\u02c8b\u025b\u03b8 /; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.

Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers. Forest Acres is a city in Richland County, South Carolina, United States.

Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine announced the selection of ALARM on 29 July 1983. The initial order was 750 missiles for the RAF. The selection process was controversial; the battle between the contractors was bitter, the Ministry of Defence favoured ALARM to retain UK industrial capabilities while the Treasury favoured the cheaper and proven HARM. The GEC merger to create a UK company compared to what would have been an Anglo-German firm, made the possibility of further penetration of the United States (US) defence market more likely.

A leading figure in the women's movement in the United States, her 1963 book The Feminine Mystique is often credited with sparking the second wave of American feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women \"into the mainstream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men.\" Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income. Unlike the median household income, which divides all households in two halves, the mean income is the average income earned by American households. In the case of mean income, the income of all households is divided by the number of all households. The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top. As a result, the mean tends to be higher than the median income, with the top earning households boosting it. Overall, the mean household income in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau 2014 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, was $72,641. The Feminine Mystique is a book written by Betty Friedan which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of second - wave feminism in the United States. It was published on February 19, 1963 by W.W. Norton.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (betty friedan, supports, the feminine mystique)\n- (the feminine mystique, sparks, second wave of american feminism)\n- (betty friedan, co-founds, national organization for women (now))\n- (betty friedan, is_elected_president_of, national organization for women (now))\n- (mean household income, uses_data_from, us census bureau annual social and economic supplement)\n- (median household income, divides_households_into, two halves)\n- (mean household income, is_usually_higher_than, median household income due to top earners)\n- (the feminine mystique, published_on, february 19, 1963)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The documentary film had its world premiere on 19 October 2013 at Sava Centar in Belgrade and was aired on Radio Television Serbia on 20 October 2014. Tito was interred in a mausoleum in Belgrade, which forms part of a memorial complex in the grounds of the Museum of Yugoslav History (formerly called \"Museum 25 May\" and \"Museum of the Revolution\"). The actual mausoleum is called House of Flowers (Kuc\u0301a Cvec\u0301a) and numerous people visit the place as a shrine to \"better times\". The museum keeps the gifts Tito received during his presidency. The collection also includes original prints of Los Caprichos by Francisco Goya, and many others. The Government of Serbia has planned to merge it into the Museum of the History of Serbia. At the time of his death, speculation began about whether his successors could continue to hold Yugoslavia together. Ethnic divisions and conflict grew and eventually erupted in a series of Yugoslav wars a decade after his death. Media in Pristina have followed all elections held in Kosova, especially a great impact was noted in Kosova local elections, 2013,where media dedicated most of their time in political debates,advertisements and political parties programs.

On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders.

Two years later, he ascended to the throne of England as King James I of England. Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery. Eventually, in the late 17th century, the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon Sir Hugh Audley by the great heiress Mary Davies.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (king james vi of scotland, attended, general assembly of the church of scotland program)\n- (king james vi of scotland, ascended_to_throne_as, king james i of england in may 1601)\n- (general assembly of the church of scotland program, held_at, st columba's church in burntisland, fife)\n- (king james i of england, leased_freehold_from, royal landlords during the 17th century)\n- (old village of eye cross, fell_into_decay, by then)\n- (area, was_mostly, wasteland state)\n- (james i, established_mulberry_garden_for_silk_production_on_part_of, crown freehold)\n- (mulberry garden, located_at, northwest corner of today's palace)\n- (clement walker, referred_to, sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at st james's in anarchia anglicana (1649))\n- (freehold, inherited_from_property_tycoon_sir_hugh_audley_by, great heiress mary davies)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Jim and Pam marry early in the season, at Niagara Falls, during the highly anticipated, hour long episode, ``Niagara ''.

The Ottoman Empire stood between the West and the East, thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing Spanish and Portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the Orient. The Empire controlled the spice route that Marco Polo once used. When Vasco da Gama bypassed Ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with India in 1498, and Christopher Columbus first journeyed to the Bahamas in 1492, the Ottoman Empire was at its zenith. In the Footsteps of Marco Polo is a 2008 PBS documentary film detailing Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell's 1993 retracing of Marco Polo's journey from Venice to Anatolia, Persia, India and China. The movie documents the first quest \"to visit and document every region Marco Polo claimed to have traveled\" using only land and sea methods of transportation. Mike Hale of \"The New York Times\" writes that the documentary includes how Belliveau and O'Donnell \"encountered Mongol horsemen and hostile Chinese security officers and survived a firefight between Afghan factions. In the spirit of Polo's journey -- and to prove a point regarding the authenticity of his account -- they disdained airplanes, traveling by foot, on horses and camels and by jeep, boat and train.\" A text by the same name as the video, \"In the Footsteps of Marco Polo\", written by Belliveau and O'Donnell, and published by Rowman & Littlefield, serves as a companion to the documentary film. \"In the Footsteps of Marco Polo\" has been used by Belliveau to create a unique interdisciplinary educational curriculum that he presents at schools and libraries across the United States and internationally.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

Roosevelt, Robert Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. as well as paternal grandfather of President Theodore Roosevelt. As many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft and toured the USA and Europe. The band also played on Broadway for the play \"Porgy\" by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the real Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage. Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel into the now famous opera, Porgy and Bess (so named so as to distinguish it from the play). George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at Folly Beach outside of Charleston writing this \"folk opera\", as Gershwin called it.

This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, as most of them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of the first-generation iPod Nano and the fifth-generation iPod Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor. As of the second-generation iPod Touch and the fourth-generation iPod Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (third generation ipod, includes, 30-pin dock connector)\n- (30-pin dock connector, allows, firewire)\n- (30-pin dock connector, allows, usb connectivity)\n- (apple, uses, 30-pin dock connector for non-apple machine compatibility)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa: During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, guitarist Jerry Horton, drummer Dave Buckner, bassist Will James, and trombonist Ben Luther. The city had a population of 1,307,402 according to the 2010 census, distributed over a land area of 372.1 square miles (963.7 km2). The urban area of San Diego extends beyond the administrative city limits and had a total population of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest urban area in the state, after that of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and San Francisco metropolitan area. They, along with the Riverside\u2013San Bernardino, form those metropolitan areas in California larger than the San Diego metropolitan area, with a total population of 3,095,313 at the 2010 census. \"Getting Away with Murder\" is the first single from the band Papa Roach's third album, \"Getting Away with Murder\". The song shows the band's new sound, the sound of the song is hard rock instead of their previous nu metal sound. The song also features no rapping at all, something that was used in Papa Roach's previous singles. The video is performance-based, showing the band playing in a Stock Exchange Hall with references filled with fans (including sexual imagery which led the band's lead singer Jacoby Shaddix to describe the video as \"stocks and bondage\" in an MTV2 interview). It was directed by Motion Theory.

He was the flag bearer of Myanmar sports team at the opening ceremony. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (zaw win thet, has_category, burmese runner)\n- (zaw win thet, competed_in_event, 400 m event)\n- (2012 summer olympics, includes_event, 400 m event)\n- (zaw win thet, represented_by, myanmar sports team)\n- (myanmar sports team, participated_in, 2012 summer olympics)\n- (myanmar sports team, has_location, kyonpyaw, pathein district, ayeyarwady division, myanmar)\n- (western european states, initiated, maritime trade routes)\n- (ottoman trade monopoly, avoided_by, western european states)\n- (portuguese discovery of the cape of good hope, year, 1488)\n- (ottoman-portuguese naval wars, initiated_in, indian ocean)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, allied_with, ottomans)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, defied, portuguese economic monopoly)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, employed, new coinage)\n- (new coinage, followed_pattern, ottoman pattern)\n- (dynasty, regrouped_and_defeated, portuguese in 1613)\n- (dynasty, regrouped_and_defeated, siam in 1614)\n- (restored toungoo kings, created, legal and political framework)\n- (legal and political framework, continued_into_19th century, basic features)\n- (crown, replaced, hereditary chieftainships, appointed governorships)\n- (irrawaddy valley, affected_by, replacement of chiefships)\n- (shan chiefs, had, hereditary rights)\n- (hereditary rights, reduced_by, restored toungoo kings)\n- (trade and administrative reforms, built, prosperous economy)\n- (prosperous economy, lasted_for, more than 80 years)\n- (meithei raids, beset, kingdom from 1720s onward)\n- (lan na, had, nagging rebellion)\n- (restored hanthawaddy kingdom, founded_in, 1740)\n- (restored hanthawaddy kingdom, sacked_ava, 1752)\n- (toungoo dynasty, ended, 1752)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century.

For the next three seasons he played occasionally for the first team either at full back or as Trevor Smith's deputy at centre-half, most notably in the first leg of the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final against A.S. Roma. When Smith sustained the injury that resulted in him leaving the club, Foster took over at centre half and kept his place for another couple of seasons. He was used less frequently in his last two years at the club, and spent three months on loan at Crewe Alexandra before making a permanent move to Plymouth Argyle where he ended his Football League career. He went on to play for Chelmsford City and Bromsgrove Rovers, and spent one season as Bromsgrove's assistant manager. The Trophy was stolen from a display in the shop window of W. Shillcock (a football fitter) in Newton Row, Birmingham, after the Final and never recovered despite a \u00a310 reward. According to the Police, it was taken sometime between 21:30 on Wednesday 11 September and 7:30 the following morning, along with cash from a drawer.

At 7,821 metres (25,659 ft) it is the 22nd highest mountain in the world and the 9th highest in Pakistan. It was the first mapped peak in the Karakoram mountain range, hence the designation \"K1\". Abul Kalam Azad expressed concern over the likelihood of violent riots, to which Mountbatten replied:At least on this question I shall give you complete assurance. I shall see to it that there is no bloodshed and riot. I am a soldier and not a civilian. Once the partition is accepted in principle, I shall issue orders to see that there are no communal disturbances anywhere in the country. If there should be the slightest agitation, I shall adopt the sternest measures to nip the trouble in the bud. Jagmohan has stated that this and what followed shows the \"glaring\" \"failure of the government machinery\".On 3 June 1947, the partition plan was accepted by the Congress Working Committee. Boloji states that in Punjab there were no riots but there was communal tension, while Gandhi was reportedly isolated by Nehru and Patel and observed maun vrat (day of silence). Mountbatten visited Gandhi and said he hoped that he would not oppose the partition, to which Gandhi wrote the reply: \"Have I ever opposed you?\"Within British India, the border between India and Pakistan (the Radcliffe Line) was determined by a British Government-commissioned report prepared under the chairmanship of a London barrister, Sir Cyril Radcliffe.

It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama.

Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established late due to mutual hostility. During World War II, the two countries were briefly allies. At the end of the war, the first signs of post-war mistrust and hostility began to appear between the two countries, escalating into the Cold War; a period of tense hostile relations, with periods of de\u0301tente.

It is celebrated by Egyptians as an annual holiday for two weeks starting August 15, known as Wafaa El - Nil. It is also celebrated in the Coptic Church by ceremonially throwing a martyr's relic into the river, hence the name, The Martyr's Finger (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca7\u2c8f\u2c83 \u2c9b\u2c99\u2c81\u2ca3\u2ca7\u2c8f\u2ca3\u2c9f\u2ca5, Arabic: Esba `al - shahi\u0304d ).

Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman\u2019s vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.

The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the United States and its democracy. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Ce\u0301vennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Loze\u0300re. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?) (also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. Pinball Quest is the name of a Nintendo Entertainment System video game developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco in 1990. The game is based on the popular arcade game pinball. The role playing aspect of the game makes it unique from other pinball based video games.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (nes, has_program, north america release program)\n- (north america release program, has_amount, 1985)\n- (nes, has_program, europe release program)\n- (europe release program, has_amount, 1986)\n- (nes, has_program, australia release program)\n- (australia release program, has_amount, 1987)\n- (fc, is_abbreviation_for, family computer)\n- (family computer, distributed_by, sk hynix)\n- (sk hynix, formerly_known_as, hyundai electronics)\n- (nes, succeeded_by, super nintendo entertainment system)\n- (super nintendo entertainment system, launched_by, nintendo)\n- (pc engine, launched_by, nec home electronics)\n- (pc engine, has_program, 1987 launch program)\n- (mega drive, launched_by, sega enterprises)\n- (mega drive, has_program, 1988 launch program)\n- (turbografx 16, launched_in, north america)\n- (turbografx 16, has_program, 1989 launch program)\n- (genesis, launched_in, north america)\n- (genesis, has_program, 1989 launch program)\n- (16 bit architectures, used_by, pc engine)\n- (16 bit architectures, used_by, mega drive)\n- (16 bit architectures, used_by, turbografx 16)\n- (16 bit architectures, used_by, genesis)\n- (pc engine, has_characteristic, improved graphics and sound)\n- (mega drive, has_characteristic, improved graphics and sound)\n- (turbografx 16, has_characteristic, improved graphics and sound)\n- (genesis, has_characteristic, improved graphics and sound)\n- (nes, has_characteristic, 8 bit architecture)\n- (pinball quest, developed_by, tose)\n- (pinball quest, published_by, jaleco)\n- (pinball quest, released_in, 1990)\n- (pinball quest, based_on, arcade game pinball)\n- (pinball quest, has_role_playing_aspect, true)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

He became Austrian minister in Turin at the court of King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, in St. Petersburg at the court of Catherine the Great, and then Paris at the court of King Louis XV of France in 1766. In Paris, his first work was to strengthen the alliance between France and Austria, which was cemented in 1770 by the marriage of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XVI, with Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria, youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, afterwards known as Queen Marie Antoinette. When Louis and Marie Antoinette ascended the throne of France in 1774, Mercy-Argenteau became one of the most powerful personages at the French court due to his influence over Marie-Antoinette, which made her unpopular with the French nobility and French people. He was in Paris during the turbulent years that led up to the French Revolution, and gave powerful aid to the finance ministers Lome\u0301nie de Brienne and Necker. In 1792, he became governor-general of the Austrian Netherlands, which had just been reduced to obedience by Austria. There, his ability and experience made him a very successful ruler. Although at first in favor of moderate courses, Mercy-Argenteau supported the action of Austria in making war upon its former ally after the outbreak of the French Revolution, and in July 1794, he was appointed Austrian ambassador to Britain, but he died a few days after his arrival in London.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (he, was_born_in, liege)\n- (born in liege, supports, birthplace)\n- (born in belgium, supports, country of birth)\n- (his father, is, antoine comte de mercy argenteau)\n- (father is antoine comte de mercy argenteau, includes, father)\n- (he, entered_diplomatic_service, austria)\n- (entered diplomatic service, supports, austria)\n- (entered paris, supports, city of diplomatic service)\n- (became austrian minister, supports, turin)\n- (became austrian minister, at_the_court_of, king charles emmanuel iii of sardinia)\n- (served as austrian minister, supports, st petersburg)\n- (was austrian minister, at_the_court_of, king louis xv of france)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Laurean Rugambwa (July 12, 1912 \u2013 December 8, 1997) was the first modern native African Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Dar es Salaam from 1968 to 1992, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1960. Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death:\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, held_opposing_views_with, roman catholic opponents)\n- (roman catholic opponents, had_issues_with, mary and saints)\n- (luther, adhered_to, marian decrees of ecumenical councils)\n- (luther, adhered_to, church dogmas)\n- (martin luther, believed_in, perpetual virginity of mary)\n- (martin luther, considered_as, theotokos or mother of god)\n- (luther, belief_in, immaculate conception)\n- (immaculate conception, declared_by, pope pius ix)\n- (pope piusix, declared_immaculate_conception_in, 1854)\n- (luther, adhered_to, immaculate conception for three centuries)\n- (luther, debated_stance_on, immaculate conception)\n- (luther, stopped_celebrating, assumption feast)\n- (luther, respected, mary)\n- (luther, criticized_papists_for, blurring line between admiration and service)\n- (luther, final_thoughts_on_marian_devotion_preserved_in, sermon at wittenberg)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism. On 18 June 1948, the National Security Council issued Directive 10/2 calling for covert action against the USSR, and granting the authority to carry out covert operations against \"hostile foreign states or groups\" that could, if needed, be denied by the U.S. government. To this end, the Office of Policy Coordination was created inside the new CIA. The OPC was quite unique; Frank Wisner, the head of the OPC, answered not to the CIA Director, but to the secretaries of defense, state, and the NSC, and the OPC's actions were a secret even from the head of the CIA.

The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry\", as both groups \u2013 the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews \u2013 shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (ashkenazi jews, support, statement that they represent the bulk of modern jewry)\n- (70%, supports, claim about their representation worldwide)\n- (90%, supports, pre-world war ii and holocaust jewish population's representation)\n- (emigration from europe, connects, ashkenazi jews with their overwhelming majority in new world continents)\n- (united states, canada, argentina, australia, brazil, support, presence of ashkenazi jews in these regions)\n- (israel, is, melting pot independent of each group's proportion within the overall world jewish population)\n- (atzmon-ostrer et al.

Philosophy, Fiqh and theology (kalaam) were further developed, most noticeably by Avicenna and his opponents. Al-Razi and Al-Farabi had provided methodology and knowledge in medicine and philosophy. Avicenna had access to the great libraries of Balkh, Khwarezm, Gorgan, Rey, Isfahan and Hamadan. Various texts (such as the 'Ahd with Bahmanyar) show that he debated philosophical points with the greatest scholars of the time. Aruzi Samarqandi describes how before Avicenna left Khwarezm he had met Al-Biruni (a famous scientist and astronomer), Abu Nasr Iraqi (a renowned mathematician), Abu Sahl Masihi (a respected philosopher) and Abu al-Khayr Khammar (a great physician). Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries.

The brand was originally produced and owned by the R. Monarch Distillery (RD #24, 2nd Dist.) of Owensboro, Kentucky, which entered bankruptcy in 1898 and was purchased by James Thompson in 1901 who renamed the company Glenmore Distillery Company with locations in Owensboro and Louisville, Kentucky. In 1903 The Kentucky Tavern trademark was first registered. Glenmore proved a successful and durable company, its main brand being Kentucky Tavern. It is usually produced as an 80 proof liquor, although a 100 proof is also available. Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Since 1972, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968. The Republicans regained the majority of the Senate in the 114th Congress, which started in January 2015; the Republicans had not controlled the Senate since January 2007. They had needed a net gain of at least six seats to obtain a majority. They held all of their seats, and gained nine Democratic - held seats.

One of the common definitions for \"Islamic philosophy\" is \"the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture.\" Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims. The Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980\u20131037) had more than 450 books attributed to him. His writings were concerned with various subjects, most notably philosophy and medicine.

In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654. The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is a 1558 painting by Titian, now in the church of I Gesuiti in Venice. It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (titian, supports, violante)\n- (kunsthistorisches museum in vienna, holds, violante)\n- (plague, affects, paris in 1466)\n- (paris, experiences_plague_during, 16th and 17th centuries)\n- (16th and 17th centuries, has_frequency_of_plague_in_paris, around 30% of the time)\n- (black death, causes_plague_outbreaks_between, russia from 1350 to 1490)\n- (plague, occurs_multiple_times_in_london_between, 1563 and 1665)\n- (london, population_reduction_during_plague_years, by 10-30%)\n- (plague, affects_amsterdam_multiple_times, including 1623\u201325, 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664)\n- (amsterdam, experiences_plague_multiple_times_between, 1361 and 1528)\n- (plague, kills_50000_people_in_venice_during, 1576\u201377)\n- (italian plague of 1629\u20131631, associated_with_troop_movements_during, thirty years' war)\n- (great plague of vienna, occurs_in, 1679)\n- (last plague outbreak, ravages_oslo_in, 1654)\n- (titian, commissions_second_version_of_the_martyrdom_of_saint_lawrence_in, 1567 for el escorial)\n- (the martyrdom of saint lawrence, now_held_at, i gesuiti in venice)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The gameplay is a first-person shooter from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. The player navigates \"sub spaces\" of a larger \"world map.\" Gameplay takes place between different subspaces. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?) (also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics.

The Scottish Parliament building was designed by Spanish architect Enric Miralles in partnership with local Edinburgh Architecture firm RMJM which was led by Design Principal Tony Kettle. Some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings, a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings. Throughout the building there are many repeated motifs, such as shapes based on Raeburn's Skating Minister. Crow-stepped gables and the upturned boat skylights of the Garden Lobby, complete the unique architecture. Queen Elizabeth II opened the new building on 9 October 2004. Presbyterian denominations that trace their heritage to the British Isles usually organise their church services inspired by the principles in the Directory of Public Worship, developed by the Westminster Assembly in the 1640s. This directory documented Reformed worship practices and theology adopted and developed over the preceding century by British Puritans, initially guided by John Calvin and John Knox. It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (scottish parliament building, designed_by, enric miralles)\n- (enric miralles, worked_with, rmjm)\n- (rmjm, led_by, tony kettle)\n- (scottish parliament building, includes, leaf-shaped buildings)\n- (scottish parliament building, includes, grass-roofed branch that merges into adjacent parkland)\n- (scottish parliament building, features, gabion walls formed from stones of previous buildings)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The song is a slight return to the band early work, starting with a rapping introduction, but as the introduction goes the rapping then goes into fast screaming making it different from the usual rapping of the band's early releases. Most of the song is singing with Jacoby singing in the verses and also choruses. The song follows the band's hard rock sound of their previous album. The song hit American radio stations on August 7, 2006. The song was played in full on Kerrang! Radio in the United Kingdom on August 1, 2006 and has since become available to download via the iTunes Store and Walmart Downloads store as a radio edit version. On September 18 the single became available in UK stores as a 7\" vinyl picture disc with a complimentary Papa Roach sticker. The CD was released on October 11, 2006. The song was used as the official theme song for \"WWE Raw\" on the USA Network from October 9, 2006 to November 9, 2009. The song has risen to #8 on the \"Mainstream Rock Tracks\" and #14 on the \"Modern Rock Tracks\" and played during the theatrical trailer of the 2008 film Never Back Down.

Roger Sherman of Connecticut, believed the clause was unnecessary because the original Constitution only gave Congress stated powers, which did not include establishing a national religion. Anti-Federalists such as Rep. Thomas Tucker of South Carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions. However, the Anti-Federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the House of Representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment. Forest Acres is a city in Richland County, South Carolina, United States. The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. Ban Pakpo, also Pak Pok or Pakpo, is a village in Vientiane Province, Laos. It is located north along Route 13 from Vang Vieng, not far from the eastern bank of the Nam Song River.

Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of Kambojas before it became part of the Achaemenid Empire. After the region's conquest by Alexander the Great it became part of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of Khujand and Panjakent) was part of Sogdia, a collection of city-states which was overrun by Scythians and Yuezhi nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The Silk Road passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian during the reign of Wudi (141\u201387 BCE) commercial relations between Han China and Sogdiana flourished. Sogdians played a major role in facilitating trade and also worked in other capacities, as farmers, carpetweavers, glassmakers, and woodcarvers. The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (500 bce, supports, achaemenid empire (includes much of modern tajikistan))\n- (achaemenid empire, includes, region)\n- (alexander the great, conquers, region)\n- (greco-bactrian kingdom, follows, alexander's conquest)\n- (sogdia, around_150_bce, is part of northern tajikistan)\n- (silk road, passes_through, region)\n- (zhang qian, expedition_leads_to, commercial relations between han china and sogdiana)\n- (sogdians, support_trade, using skills in facilitating trade)\n- (sogdians, work_as, farmers)\n- (sogdians, work_as, carpetweavers)\n- (sogdians, work_as, glassmakers)\n- (sogdians, work_as, woodcarvers)\n- (hellenistic period, covers, period of ancient greek history and mediterranean history between 323 bc and 31 bc)\n- (competitive public games, take_place_during, hellenistic period)\n- (ideas in biology, developed_during, hellenistic period)\n- (popular entertainment in theaters, feature_of, hellenistic period)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

This foreign presence marks the only time in Japan's history that it has been occupied by a foreign power. The country became a parliamentary democracy that recalled ``New Deal ''priorities of the 1930s by Roosevelt.

It was shot at Denham Studios. The film's sets were designed by the art director Frederick Pusey. The term air defence was probably first used by Britain when Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) was created as a Royal Air Force command in 1925. However, arrangements in the UK were also called 'anti-aircraft', abbreviated as AA, a term that remained in general use into the 1950s. After the First World War it was sometimes prefixed by 'Light' or 'Heavy' (LAA or HAA) to classify a type of gun or unit.

It so impressed Philip II of Spain that he commissioned a second version in 1567 for the basilica at El Escorial. The Worship of Venus is an oil on canvas painting by the Italian artist Titian completed between 1518\u20131519, housed at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. It describes a Roman rite of worship conducted in honour of the goddess Venus each 1 April. On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to cleanse \"every blemish on their bodies\". In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population.

The karst limestone cave was only discovered in April 2004 by a local farmer who upon entering it found a treasure trove of 229 Buddha statues, estimated to be over 450 years old. It is believed that the Buddha statues were hidden to prevent them being looted by invading Haw peoples. The largest Buddha statue is seated at the main entrance. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (tham pha, has_program, buddha cave discovery program)\n- (buddha cave discovery program, has_amount, 2004)\n- (buddha cave discovery program, targets, local farmer)\n- (buddha cave, located_in, khammouane province program)\n- (khammouane province program, has_amount, laos)\n- (khammouane province program, targets, buddha cave)\n- (buddha cave, discovered_in, april 2004 program)\n- (april 2004 program, has_amount, 2004)\n- (april 2004 program, targets, tham pha)\n- (buddha cave, contains, treasure trove of buddha statues program)\n- (treasure trove of buddha statues program, has_amount, 229)\n- (treasure trove of buddha statues program, targets, buddha cave)\n- (buddha statues, estimated_age, over 450 years old program)\n- (over 450 years old program, has_amount, buddha statues)\n- (over 450 years old program, targets, buddha cave)\n- (buddha statues, hidden_to_prevent, looting by invading haw peoples program)\n- (looting by invading haw peoples program, has_amount, buddha cave)\n- (looting by invading haw peoples program, targets, buddha statues)\n- (largest buddha statue, seated_at, main entrance of buddha cave program)\n- (main entrance of buddha cave program, has_amount, largest buddha statue)\n- (main entrance of buddha cave program, targets, buddha cave)\n- (toungoo dynasty, regrouped_and_defeated, portuguese in 1613 program)\n- (1613 program, has_amount, toungoo dynasty)\n- (1613 program, targets, portuguese)\n- (toungoo dynasty, also_defeated, siam in 1614 program)\n- (1614 program, has_amount, toungoo dynasty)\n- (1614 program, targets, siam)\n- (toungoo dynasty, created_legal_and_political_framework, basic features continued into 19th century program)\n- (basic features continued into 19th century program, has_amount, toungoo dynasty)\n- (basic features continued into 19th century program, targets, legal and political framework)\n- (crown, replaced_hereditary_chieftainships_with_appointed_governorships, entire irrawaddy valley program)\n- (hereditary chieftainships program, has_amount, entire irrawaddy valley)\n- (hereditary chieftainships program, targets, appointed governorships)\n- (kingdom, reduced_hereditary_rights_of, shan chiefs program)\n- (shan chiefs program, has_amount, kingdom)\n- (shan chiefs program, targets, hereditary rights)\n- (trade and secular administrative reforms, built_prosperous_economy_for_more_than_80_years, event program)\n- (event program, has_amount, 80 years)\n- (event program, targets, trade and secular administrative reforms)\n- (from the 1720s onward, kingdom_beset_with_repeated_meithei_raids_into_upper myanmar, time period program)\n- (time period program, has_amount, from the 1720s onward)\n- (time period program, targets, kingdom beset with repeated meithei raids into upper myanmar)\n- (nagging rebellion, occurred_in, lan na program)\n- (lan na program, has_amount, nagging rebellion)\n- (lan na program, targets, kingdom)\n- (hanthawaddy forces, sacked, ava in 1752 program)\n- (1752 program, has_amount, hanthawaddy forces)\n- (1752 program, targets, ava)\n- (sacking of ava, ended_266_year_old_toungoo_dynasty, event program)\n- (event program, has_amount, sacking of ava)\n- (event program, targets, 266-year-old toungoo dynasty)\n- (portuguese discovery of cape of good hope in 1488, initiated_series_of_ottoman-portuguese_naval_wars_in_the_indian_ocean_throughout_the_16th_century, event program)\n- (event program, has_amount, portuguese discovery of cape of good hope in 1488)\n- (event program, targets, ottoman-portuguese naval wars)\n- (event program, has_amount, western european states discovered new maritime trade routes)\n- (event program, targets, avoiding ottoman trade monopoly)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. WWNQ is a radio station licensed to Forest Acres, South Carolina, serving the Columbia, South Carolina market. Owned by Midlands Media Group LLC, the station broadcasts a country music format branded as 94.3 The Dude. Sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the Mason\u2013Dixon line and those south of it, primarily centered on the \"peculiar institution\" of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government. During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South seceded from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was loyal to the Union. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (forest acres, supports, wwnq)\n- (wwnq, broadcasts_in, columbia, south carolina metropolitan statistical area)\n- (wwnq, owned_by, midlands media group llc)\n- (midlands media group llc, awards, 94.3 the dude)\n- (richland county, contains, forest acres)\n- (south carolina, contains, richland county and columbia, south carolina metropolitan statistical area)\n- (united states, contains, south carolina)\n- (columbia, south carolina metropolitan statistical area, serves, wwnq)\n- (mason\u2013dixon line, separates, states north and south)\n- (slavery, supports_conflict_over, sectional tensions between states north and south of mason\u2013dixon line)\n- (national government, decisions_overruled_by, slavery)\n- (abraham lincoln, election_in_1860_leads_to, south carolina seceding from the united states)\n- (south carolina, secedes_from, united states)\n- (confederate states of america, alias_for, confederacy)\n- (fort sumter, military_installation_of, confederate forces)\n- (american civil war, starts_with, confederate forces open fire on fort sumter in april 1861)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The main cause was opposition to the Kansas -- Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise by which slavery was kept out of Kansas. The Northern Republicans saw the expansion of slavery as a great evil. The first public meeting of the general ``anti-Nebraska ''movement where the name`` Republican'' was suggested for a new anti-slavery party was held on March 20, 1854, in a schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin. The name was partly chosen to pay homage to Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party. The Kansas -- Nebraska Act divided the nation and pointed it toward civil war. The Act itself virtually nullified the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The turmoil over the act split both the Democratic and Whig parties and gave rise to the Republican Party, which split the United States into two major political camps, the Republican North and the Democratic South.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (anti-slavery activists, support, republican party)\n- (republican party, has_program, 1854 program)\n- (1854 program, has_amount, not specified amount for target northern states)\n- (modernizers, support, republican party)\n- (ex whigs, support, republican party)\n- (ex free soilers, support, republican party)\n- (kansas -- nebraska act, nullifies, missouri compromise)\n- (missouri compromise, is_nullified_by, kansas -- nebraska act)\n- (democratic party, divided_by, nullification of missouri compromise)\n- (whig party, divided_by, nullification of missouri compromise)\n- (first public meeting, held_on, march 20, 1854)\n- (first public meeting, location_in, ripon, wisconsin)\n- (name \"republican\", suggested_at, first public meeting)\n- (suggestion, honors, thomas jefferson's republican party)\n- (republican party, becomes_principal_opposition_to, democratic party)\n- (republican party, gives_rise_to, republican north)\n- (republican party, gives_rise_to, democratic south)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

She had seen the sheet music in the Woods Building in Chicago and the lyrics attracted her. She recorded the song in February, 1952, in Chicago and it was released in March on the local Sharp Records label. After she signed to MGM, it was reissued as her second single on that label on August 5, 1952, after Jo Stafford, Patti Page and Dean Martin had covered it. James' version also was issued on M-G-M Records for national distribution. The best - known early 1952 version of the song was recorded after James' recording by Sue Thompson on Mercury's country label as catalog number 6407. It was soon covered by Patti Page, whose version was issued by Mercury as catalog number 5899, with ``I Went to Your Wedding ''(a bigger Patti Page hit, reaching No 1) on the flip side. It entered the Billboard chart on August 22, 1952, and lasted 12 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 4. Let There Be Love is Joni James debut album, recorded in 1953 and released by MGM Records at the end of the year. It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 331\u20443-rpm album.

His other contribution was the concept of preventive policing; his police were to act as a highly visible deterrent to crime by their permanent presence on the Thames.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Nam Khan is a river in Laos. It flows through Luang Prabang. It is a major tributary of the river Mekong, with which it joins at Luang Prabang. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century.

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. During a meeting at Atlantic Hotel (Hamburg) in 1953, a group of Iranian residents of Germany discussed the need to establish their own religious center. A letter was sent to the late Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi asking him for help; Grand Ayatollah agreed with the plan and donated 100,000 Rials to the center. The construction began in 1960 and by 1965 it was completed. In the same year Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti was appointed to lead the center. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast.

Having secured the support of the Hudson's Bay Company, he set out on a second, much longer voyage from Toronto across the Rocky Mountains to Fort Vancouver and Fort Victoria. Casa Loma (Spanish for ``Hill House '') is a Gothic Revival style mansion and garden in midtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that is now a historic house museum and landmark. It was constructed from 1911 to 1914 as a residence for financier Sir Henry Pellatt. The architect was E. J. Lennox, who designed several other city landmarks. Casa Loma sits at an elevation of 140 metres (460 ft) above sea level. Scene in the Northwest: Portrait of John Henry Lefroy, also known as The Surveyor, is a painting by Paul Kane circa 1845. It sold at auction in 2002 for C$5.1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian painting ever sold at that time.

The Brabantian dialect group, for instance, also extends to much of the south of the Netherlands, and so does Limburgish. West Flemish is also spoken in Zeelandic Flanders (part of the Dutch province of Zeeland), and by older people in French Flanders (a small area that borders Belgium). Finally, an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces.

It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Myint Myint Aye (born 18 November 1977) is a retired athlete who represented Myanmar in the middle-distance events.

In the course of the conflict every bridge across the river except one was destroyed. The one remaining bridge was the Sino -- Korean Friendship Bridge connecting Sinuiju, North Korea to Dandong, China. During the war the valley surrounding the western end of the river also became the focal point of a series of dogfights for air superiority over North Korea, earning the nickname ``MiG Alley ''in reference to the MiG - 15 fighters flown by the combined North Korean, Chinese and Soviet forces. For the remainder of the Korean War the UN Command and the PVA fought, but exchanged little territory; the stalemate held. Large - scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began 10 July 1951 at Kaesong. On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team. Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the UN Command forces' goal was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory.

Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians. In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations (1948), Stalin published Falsifiers of History, which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution. Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy - year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the tsfsr, exists_from_1922_to_1936, program)\n- (program, includes, armenian ssr)\n- (program, includes, azerbaijan ssr)\n- (program, includes, georgian ssr)\n- (armenian ssr, part_of, the tsfsr program)\n- (azerbaijan ssr, part_of, the tsfsr program)\n- (georgian ssr, part_of, the tsfsr program)\n- (armenians, enjoyed_relative_stability_under_soviet_rule, program)\n- (program, provides, relative stability for armenians)\n- (program, targets, armenians)\n- (moscow, provided_support_to_armenians, medicine)\n- (moscow, provided_support_to_armenians, food)\n- (moscow, provided_support_to_armenians, provisions)\n- (soviet rule, provides_relative_stability_for_armenians, compared to turbulent final years of the ottoman empire)\n- (vladimir lenin, died, event)\n- (event, leads_to, joseph stalin taking reins of power)\n- (joseph stalin, took_reins_of_power, program)\n- (program, initiated_by, joseph stalin)\n- (stalin, initiated_program_of_renewed_fear_and_terror_for_armenians, program)\n- (publication of secret protocols and other german\u2013soviet relations documents in 1948, triggers_publication_of_falsifiers_of_history, event)\n- (event, leads_to, publication of falsifiers of history)\n- (falsifiers of history, persisted_until_soviet_ussr_dissolution, program)\n- (program, includes, falsifiers of history in historical studies)\n- (program, includes, falsifiers of history in official accounts)\n- (program, includes, falsifiers of history in memorials)\n- (program, includes, falsifiers of history in textbooks)\n- (1977 constitution of the ussr, defines_office_of_chairman_of_the_council_of_ministers_as_head_of_government, program)\n- (office of chairman of the council of ministers, comparable_to_prime_minister_in_first_world, program)\n- (office of chairman of the presidium, comparable_to_president_in_first_world, program)\n- (soviet ussr history, has_no_official_leader_office, program)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. Caspar Voght (17 November 1752 \u2013 20 March 1839), later Caspar Reichsfreiherr von Voght (more commonly known as Baron Caspar von Voght), was a German merchant and social reformer from Hamburg (today Germany). Together with his business partner and friend Georg Heinrich Sieveking he led one of the largest trading firms in Hamburg during the second half of the 18th Century. On numerous trade trips, he completely crossed the European continent. One of his greatest achievements was reforming the welfare system of Hamburg. From 1785 he dedicated himself to strengthening agricultural and horticultural projects and built a model agricultural community in Flottbek, close to the gates of Hamburg. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast.

Beyonce\u0301 also ventured into acting, with a Golden Globe-nominated performance in Dreamgirls (2006), and starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006) and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay Z and portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am...

(also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. It was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Drac's Night Out is the title of an unreleased video game developed by Mark Lesser and Rex Bradford of Microsmiths that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988.

These influences are manifested in the local language, music, dance, sea navigation, cuisine, fishing, games (such as batu, chonka, estuleks, and bayogu), songs and fashion. During Spanish colonial rule (1668\u20131898) the majority of the population was converted to Roman Catholicism and religious festivities such as Easter and Christmas became widespread. Post-contact Chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn, and includes tortillas, tamales, atole and chilaquiles, which are a clear influence from Spanish trade between Mesoamerica and Asia. The modern Chamorro language is a Malayo-Polynesian language with much Spanish and Filipino influence. Many Chamorros also have Spanish surnames because of their conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity and the adoption of names from the Cata\u0301logo alfabe\u0301tico de apellidos, a phenomenon also common to the Philippines. Many Christians still practice their traditional cultural beliefs and rituals along with Christianity. The Catholic Church has fused some aspects of local culture into its services. For example, the singing of hymns during services has developed into a local and traditional way of singing (a repetitive call and response style) in Sesotho, the indigenous language, as well as English. In addition priests are seen dressed in local dress during services. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (chamorro culture, includes, local language)\n- (local language, has_influence, spanish)\n- (local language, has_influence, filipino)\n- (chamorro culture, includes, music)\n- (music, has_influence, american)\n- (music, has_influence, spanish)\n- (music, has_influence, filipino)\n- (music, has_influence, micronesian islander)\n- (music, has_influence, mexican)\n- (chamorro culture, includes, dance)\n- (dance, has_influence, american)\n- (dance, has_influence, spanish)\n- (dance, has_influence, filipino)\n- (dance, has_influence, micronesian islander)\n- (dance, has_influence, mexican)\n- (chamorro culture, includes, sea navigation)\n- (sea navigation, has_influence, american)\n- (sea navigation, has_influence, spanish)\n- (sea navigation, has_influence, filipino)\n- (sea navigation, has_influence, micronesian islander)\n- (sea navigation, has_influence, mexican)\n- (chamorro culture, includes, cuisine)\n- (cuisine, uses, corn)\n- (cuisine, influenced_by, spanish trade between mesoamerica and asia)\n- (fishing, included_in, chamorro culture)\n- (games, includes, batu)\n- (games, includes, chonka)\n- (games, includes, estuleks)\n- (games, includes, bayogu)\n- (easter, widespread_during, spanish colonial rule)\n- (christmas, widespread_during, spanish colonial rule)\n- (roman catholicism, converted_majority_to, chamorro people)\n- (modern chamorro language, is_a, malayo polynesian language)\n- (modern chamorro language, has_influence, spanish)\n- (modern chamorro language, has_influence, filipino)\n- (spanish surnames, adopted_by, many chamorros)\n- (cata\u0301logo alfabe\u0301tico de apellidos, source_of, chamorro surnames)\n- (traditional cultural beliefs and rituals, practiced_alongside, christianity)\n- (catholic church, incorporates_local_culture_into_services, singing hymns in call and response style)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Katharina von Bora (; 29 January 1499 \u2013 20 December 1552), after her wedding Katharina Luther, also referred to as \"die Lutherin\" (\"the Lutheress\"), was the wife of Martin Luther, German reformer and a seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. Beyond what is found in the writings of Luther and some of his contemporaries, little is known about her. Despite this, Katharina is often considered one of the most important participants in the Reformation because of her role in helping to define Protestant family life and setting the tone for clergy marriages.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (phenomenon nationalism, requires, rise of national identity among people)\n- (institution western schism, erodes, loyalty to papacy)\n- (outcome perceived corruption, influences, events in context of protestant reformation)\n- (movement humanism, contributes, questioning traditional thought)\n- (period renaissance, contributes, changes in religious beliefs)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was Ali's son from another wife from the Bani Hanifa tribe of central Arabia named Khawlah bint Ja'far, whom Ali had married after Fatimah's death. One account in Tabari says that the first male convert is Zayd ibn Harithah, a freed slave who had become Muhammad's adopted son. It is known that Ali is the first person to convert to Islam, however some dispute this arguing he was only 12 years old at the time he embraced Islam. Lebanon has several different main religions. The country has the most religiously diverse society of all states within the Middle East, comprising 18 recognized religious sects. The main two religions are Islam (Shia and Sunni) with 54% of followers and Christianity (the Maronite Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Protestant Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church) with 40.4% of followers.

After it was dissolved in 1922, many of its members joined the similar National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) instead.

However, the Freikorps also despised the Republic and were involved in assassinations of its supporters.

Owned by Midlands Media Group LLC, the station broadcasts a country music format branded as 94.3 The Dude. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers. The Peace Center is a performing arts center located in Greenville, South Carolina. It is composed of a concert hall, theater, and amphitheatre. It is located adjacent to Falls Park.

They had needed a net gain of at least six seats to obtain a majority. They held all of their seats, and gained nine Democratic - held seats. Republicans defeated five Democratic incumbents: The One Hundred Fourteenth United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 2015, to January 3, 2017, during the final two full years of Barack Obama's presidency. The 2014 elections gave the Republicans control of the Senate (and control of both houses of Congress) for the first time since the 109th Congress. With 248 seats in the House of Representatives and 54 seats in the Senate, this Congress began with the largest Republican majority since the 71st Congress of 1929 -- 1931. The heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the President and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the ``nuclear option ''during the 113th US Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by \u2044 supermajority to further consideration).

The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers. Ocean Forest Country Club, also known as Ocean Forest Hotel and Country Club, is a historic country club and hotel located at Myrtle Beach in Horry County, South Carolina. The club and hotel were designed by an influential New York architect, Raymond Hood (1881-1934) and is an unusual example of Classical Revival architecture. Construction of the club began in 1926 and was completed in 1927. In addition to the hotel / club building, a 27-hole golf course was built in association with the club. It was designed by Robert White, a golf course designer and future president of the Professional Golfers' Association of America. The present 18-hole course dates to 1946.

Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin. Jean Mathonet (6 October 1925, Be\u0301verce\u0301, Malmedy \u2013 22 October 2004, Malmedy) was a Belgian football player who finished top scorer of the Belgian First Division with 26 goals in 1956 while playing for Standard Lie\u0300ge. He played 13 times with the Belgian national team between 1952 and 1958. Mathonet made his international debut on Christmas 1952 in a 0\u20131 friendly win against France.

The first major warship produced by the U.S. Navy after World War II (and in the Cold War) were \"frigates\"\u2014the ships were originally designated destroyer leaders but reclassified in 1975 as guided missile cruisers (except the became guided missile destroyers). These grew out of the last all-gun destroyers of the 1950s. In the middle 1970s the s entered service, optimized for anti-submarine warfare. A special class of guided missile destroyers was produced for the Shah of Iran, but due to the Iranian Revolution these ships could not be delivered and were added to the U.S. Navy. The United States Navy's ``Sea, Air, and Land ''Teams, commonly abbreviated as the Navy SEALs, are the U.S. Navy's primary special operations force and a component of the Naval Special Warfare Command.

On October 2010 Shell's gas stations and the heavy vehicle fuel supply networks in Finland and Sweden, along with a refinery located in Gothenburg, Sweden were sold to St1, a Finnish energy company, more precisely to its major shareholding parent company Keele Oy. Shell branded gas stations will be rebranded within maximum of five years from the acquisition and the number of gas stations is likely to be reduced.

Artists such as Peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings. According to Pliny, \"He painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of rhyparographos [painter of dirt/low things]. In these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures\" (Natural History, Book XXXV.112). Even barbarians, such as the Galatians, were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage. The image of Alexander the Great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating Alexander's youthful look. A number of the best-known works of Greek sculpture belong to the Hellenistic period, including Laocoo\u0308n and his Sons, Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace. The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (peiraikos, has_program, depiction of mundane and lower class subjects program)\n- (peiraikos, supports, depiction of mundane and lower class subjects)\n- (decoration with barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables, targets, peiraikos)\n- (alexander the great, includes, important artistic theme in hellenistic art)\n- (diadochi, imitates, alexander\u2019s youthful look)\n- (hellenistic period, spans_from, 323 bc)\n- (hellenistic period, ends_with, battle of actium in 31 bc)\n- (greek cultural influence and power, covers, europe)\n- (greek cultural influence and power, covers, africa)\n- (greek cultural influence and power, covers, asia)\n- (roman empire, emerges_as_significant_event_during, hellenistic period)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. Before the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: Hejaz (Tihamah), Najd (Al - Yamama), Southern Arabia (Hadhramaut) and Eastern Arabia. Hejaz and Najd make up most of Saudi Arabia. Southern Arabia consists of Yemen and some parts of Saudi Arabia (Najran, Jizan, Asir) and Oman (Dhofar). Eastern Arabia consists of the entire coastal strip of the Persian Gulf. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, southwest asia program)\n- (southwest asia program, targets, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, persian gulf coastlines program)\n- (persian gulf coastlines program, has_amount, 80% of total coastline)\n- (persian gulf coastlines program, targets, persian gulf body of water)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, red sea coastlines program)\n- (red sea coastlines program, has_amount, 20% of total coastline)\n- (red sea coastlines program, targets, red sea body of water)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, yemen north program)\n- (yemen north program, targets, yemen country)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, arabian peninsula occupation program)\n- (arabian peninsula occupation program, has_amount, 80% of total area)\n- (arabian peninsula occupation program, includes, hejaz region)\n- (arabian peninsula occupation program, includes, najd region)\n- (hejaz region, is_part_of, arabian peninsula geographical feature)\n- (najd region, is_part_of, arabian peninsula geographical feature)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, southern arabia distribution program)\n- (southern arabia distribution program, targets, yemen country)\n- (southern arabia distribution program, includes, asir subregion)\n- (southern arabia distribution program, includes, jizan subregion)\n- (southern arabia distribution program, includes, najran subregion)\n- (southern arabia distribution program, includes, saudi arabian regions)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, eastern arabia coastal strip program)\n- (eastern arabia coastal strip program, targets, persian gulf body of water)\n- (eastern arabia coastal strip program, covers_entire, entire coastal strip)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, tribal rulers control program)\n- (tribal rulers control program, covers_period, much of the region's history)\n- (tribal rulers control program, includes, al saud minor tribal rulers)\n- (al saud, is_minor_tribal_ruler_in, najd subregion)\n- (najd subregion, is_part_of, saudi arabia country)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.

Once again, Marvel attempted to diversify, and with the updating of the Comics Code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror (The Tomb of Dracula), martial arts, (Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu), sword-and-sorcery (Conan the Barbarian, Red Sonja), satire (Howard the Duck) and science fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey, \"Killraven\" in Amazing Adventures, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, and, late in the decade, the long-running Star Wars series). Some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines, under its Curtis Magazines imprint. Marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line. Marvel pulled ahead of rival DC Comics in 1972, during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux. Goodman increased the price and size of Marvel's November 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages. DC followed suit, but Marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages, offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount. Howard the Duck is a 1986 American comic science fiction film directed by Willard Huyck and starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins. Based on the Marvel comic book of the same title, the film was produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz, with George Lucas as executive producer. The screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film, but the film adaptation became live-action because of a contractual obligation.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (marvel, supports, diversification efforts through updating the comics code)\n- (marvel, updates, comics code including themes such as horror)\n- (the tomb of dracula, included, in updating the comics code)\n- (shang-chi: master of kung fu, included, in updating the comics code)\n- (conan the barbarian, included, in updating the comics code)\n- (red sonja, included, in updating the comics code)\n- (howard the duck, included, in updating the comics code)\n- (2001: a space odyssey, included, in updating the comics code)\n- (killraven, included, in amazing adventures, battlestar galactica, star trek, and the long-running star wars series)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish titles like the tomb of dracula)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish shang-chi: master of kung fu)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish conan the barbarian)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish red sonja)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish howard the duck)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish 2001: a space odyssey)\n- (marvel, uses, curtis magazines imprint to publish killraven in amazing adventures, battlestar galactica, star trek, and the long-running star wars series)\n- (marvel, capitalizes on, successful superhero comics by acquiring a new newsstand distributor)\n- (marvel, expands, its comics line through strategic pricing and format changes)\n- (goodman, increases, price of marvel's november 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages to 25 cents for 52 pages)\n- (dc comics, follows suit by increasing, their prices)\n- (marvel, drops, its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages with a higher distributor discount)\n- (howard the duck, adapted into, film in 1986)\n- (the film adaptation of howard the duck, directed by, willard huyck)\n- (the film adaptation of howard the duck, stars, lea thompson)\n- (the film adaptation of howard the duck, stars, jeffrey jones)\n- (the film adaptation of howard the duck, stars, tim robbins)\n- (gloria katz, produced, the film adaptation of howard the duck)\n- (howard the duck, executive producer, george lucas)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The couple are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years.

The first year (1914) it went mainstream, the Socialist party had 27 more registered members than the Prohibition Party, who were some members of the Suffrage movement. The Socialist party was similar to the Progressive Party in the county, as it tried from the outskirts of government to make change. While Socialism failed its first year, it still received attention from the press who was aware of the October Revolution (1918) in Russia (Now the Soviet Union) by a similarly named government led by Vladimir Lenin. Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the Tualatin Mountains, more commonly referred to locally as the ``West Hills '', pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. Council Crest Park, commonly thought of as the highest point within city limits, is in the West Hills and rises to an elevation of 1,073 feet (327 m) The city's actual high point is a little - known and infrequently accessed point (1,180 feet) near Forest Park. The highest point east of the river is Mt. Tabor, an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to 636 feet (194 m). Nearby Powell Butte and Rocky Butte rise to 614 feet (187 m) and 612 feet (187 m), respectively.

Until then, the court was unaware that Deshin Shekpa had died in 1415. The Ming court had believed that the representatives of the Karma Kagyu who continued to visit the Ming capital were sent by the Karmapa. Archaeological discovery shows that \"Nanjing Man\" lived in more than 500 thousand years ago. Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang.

Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang. During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84. The libretto was by Grazio Braccioli. In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528.

Buchanan & Press is an American debate show on MSNBC pairing former \"Crossfire\" hosts conservative Pat Buchanan and liberal Bill Press. The show was cancelled due to both hosts opposition to the 2003 Iraq War. MSNBC is an American news cable and satellite television network that provides news coverage and political commentary from NBC News on current events. MSNBC is owned by the NBCUniversal News Group, a unit of the NBCUniversal Television Group division of NBCUniversal (all of which are ultimately owned by Comcast). MSNBC and its website were founded in 1996 under a partnership between Microsoft and General Electric's NBC unit, hence the network's naming. Although they had the same name, msnbc.com and MSNBC maintained separate corporate structures and news operations. msnbc.com was headquartered on the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington while MSNBC operated out of NBC's headquarters in New York City. Microsoft divested its stakes in the MSNBC channel in 2005 and in msnbc.com in July 2012. The general news site was rebranded as NBCNews.com, and a new msnbc.com was created as the online home of the cable channel.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (microsoft hyper-v, supports, creation of virtual machines on x86-64 systems running windows)\n- (microsoft hyper-v, is_a, native hypervisor)\n- (microsoft hyper-v, can_create, virtual machines)\n- (x86-64 systems running windows, are_hosted_by, microsoft hyper-v)\n- (bridge: microsoft hyper-v, creates_virtual_machines_on, x86-64 systems running windows)\n- (windows 8, introduced, use of microsoft hyper-v as primary virtualization technology)\n- (windows virtual pc, was_superseded_by, microsoft hyper-v starting with windows 8)\n- (msnbc, founded_by, partnership between microsoft and nbc unit)\n- (nbc, is_a_division_of, nbcuniversal)\n- (nbcuniversal, is_a_unit_of, comcast)\n- (redmond, washington, is headquarters of, microsoft)\n- (new york city, hosts, msnbc)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It entered academic usage when the University of Bologna adopted the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (\"nurturing mother of studies\"), which describes its heritage as the oldest operating university in the Western world. It is related to alumnus, a term used for a university graduate that literally means a \"nursling\" or \"one who is nourished\". Hillcrest High School is a high school located at 3319 N. Grant Avenue in Springfield, Missouri. Hillcrest High School is one of five public high schools in Springfield Public Schools. It is located in the north part of Springfield. It was opened in 1958. As of 2015, there was an enrollment of 1,054 students, making it the smallest of the five public high schools in Springfield. The Alma Mater is a bronze statue by sculptor Lorado Taft, a beloved symbol of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The 10,000-pound statue depicts a mother-figure wearing academic robes and flanked by two attendant figures representing \"Learning\" and \"Labor\", after the University's motto \"Learning and Labor.\" Sited at the corner of Green and Wright Streets at the heart of the campus, the statue is an iconic figure for the university and a popular backdrop for student graduation photos. It is appreciated for its romantic, heraldic overtones and warmth of pose. The statue was removed from its site at the entrance to the university for restoration in 2012 and was returned to its site in the spring of 2014. Springfield's original name was Calhoun, after Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (alma mater title, supports, various latin mother goddesses)\n- (alma mater title, supports, ceres)\n- (alma mater title, supports, cybele)\n- (alma mater title, supports, virgin mary)\n- (university of bologna, adopts, motto alma mater studiorum)\n- (motto alma mater studiorum, describes, heritage as the oldest operating university in the western world)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Calhoun of South Carolina. The land that Springfield now occupies was originally settled by trappers and traders who came to the Sangamon River in 1818. The settlement's first cabin was built in 1820, by John Kelly. It was located at what is now the northwest corner of Second Street and Jefferson Street. In 1821, Calhoun became the county seat of Sangamon County due to fertile soil and trading opportunities. Settlers from Kentucky, Virginia, and as far as North Carolina came to the city. By 1832, Senator Calhoun had fallen out of the favor with the public and the town renamed itself Springfield after Springfield, Massachusetts. At that time, Springfield, Massachusetts was comparable to modern - day Silicon Valley -- known for industrial innovation, concentrated prosperity, and the celebrated Springfield Armory. Most importantly, it was a city that had built itself up from frontier outpost to national power through ingenuity -- an example that the newly named Springfield, Illinois, sought to emulate. Kaskaskia was the first capital of the Illinois Territory from its organization in 1809, continuing through statehood in 1818, and through the first year as a state in 1819. Vandalia was the second state capital of Illinois from 1819 to 1839. Springfield became the third and current capital of Illinois in 1839. The designation was largely due to the efforts of Abraham Lincoln and his associates; nicknamed the ``Long Nine ''for their combined height of 54 feet (16 m).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (springfield city, supports, renaming after springfield massachusetts)\n- (springfield massachusetts, includes, industrial innovation)\n- (springfield massachusetts, includes, concentrated prosperity)\n- (springfield massachusetts, includes, springfield armory)\n- (springfield massachusetts, is_comparable_to, modern-day silicon valley)\n- (calhoun name, supports, being named after senator john c. calhoun of south carolina)\n- (calhoun name, became_county_seat_due_to, fertile soil and trading opportunities in 1821)\n- (sangamon county's capital, moved_from, kaskaskia city from 1809 to 1818)\n- (sangamon county's capital, moved_to, vandalia city from 1819 to 1839)\n- (sangamon county's capital, moved_to, springfield city in 1839)\n- (kaskaskia city, was_first_capital_of, illinois territory from 1809 to 1818)\n- (vandalia city, became_second_state_capital_of, illinois from 1819 to 1839)\n- (springfield city, supports, renaming after springfield massachusetts in 1832)\n- (john kelly person, built_first_cabin_at, northwest corner of second street and jefferson street in 1820)\n- (calhoun name, was_named_after, senator john c. calhoun of south carolina)\n- (sangamon county's capital, moved_to, calhoun city in 1821)\n- (springfield illinois, became_third_state_capital_in, 1839 due to efforts of \"long nine\")\n- (\"long nine\", supported, springfield becoming capital)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His mother was an offspring of the influential Bunnag family, the daughter of Thet Bunnag (later Chao Phraya Suraphan Phisut), making him a direct descendant of Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse. Controversy arose during the making of the film due to 20th Century Fox's bulldozing and landscaping of the natural beach setting of Ko Phi Phi Leh to make it more ``paradise - like ''. The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach.

Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (martin luther, started, reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt)\n- (reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt, has program, ninety-five theses document)\n- (ninety-five theses document, has_amount, 95 theses for target indulgences practice)\n- (reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt, incorporated, sola scriptura doctrine)\n- (sola scriptura doctrine, context, biblical reliance)\n- (reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt, incorporated, sola fide doctrine)\n- (sola fide doctrine, context, salvation through faith in jesus)\n- (reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt, criticized, indulgences practice)\n- (indulgences practice, criticized_by, reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt)\n- (reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt, opposed, marian decrees church doctrine)\n- (marian decrees church doctrine, opposed_by, reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt)\n- (reformation event in wittenberg, saxony-anhalt, held fast to, sola scriptura and sola fide doctrines)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Vincentas Sladkevic\u030cius, MIC (20 August 1920 \u2013 28 May 2000) was a Lithuanian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (he, believed, theotokos or mother of god)\n- (he, held_fast_to, perpetual virgin belief three-hundred years before immaculate conception dogmatization by pope pius ix in 1854)\n- (he, maintained, sinlessness of mary throughout her life)\n- (assumption of mary, was_understood_fact_early_in_luther's_life, but stopped celebrating feast)\n- (luther, preached_taught_argued_about, veneration of mary with a range from childlike pietiness to sophisticated polemics)\n- (luther's views on marian devotion and veneration, are_intimately_linked_to, christocentric theology)\n- (luther, criticized, papists for blurring line between high admiration of grace of god and religious service given to another creature)\n- (luther, considered, roman catholic practice of celebrating saints days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to mary and other departed saints idolatry)\n- (luther's final thoughts on marian devotion and veneration, preserved_in, sermon preached at wittenberg only a month before his death)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. As a major Chinese city, Nanjing is home to many professional sports teams. Jiangsu Sainty, the football club currently staying in Chinese Super League, is a long-term tenant of Nanjing Olympic Sports Center. Jiangsu Nangang Basketball Club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in China top level league, CBA.

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. Of the 47 AFC member associations, a total of 44 teams entered the competition. The final tournament hosts Thailand decided to participate in qualification despite having automatically qualified for the final tournament. The most common way for travellers to enter the country seems to be by air. According to the website Lonely Planet, getting into Myanmar is problematic: \"No bus or train service connects Myanmar with another country, nor can you travel by car or motorcycle across the border \u2013 you must walk across.\", and states that, \"It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from Myanmar by sea or river.\" There are a small number of border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles, such as the border between Ruili (China) to Mu-se, the border between Htee Kee (Myanmar) and Ban Phu Nam Ron (Thailand) (the most direct border between Dawei and Kanchanaburi), and the border between Myawaddy (Myanmar) and Mae Sot (Thailand). At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland routes through these borders since 2013. \"From Mae Sai (Thailand) you can cross to Tachileik, but can only go as far as Kengtung.

The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford or Cowford; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council on February 9, 1832. There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Cla\u0301sico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (spain, ceded_territory_to, britain in 1763)\n- (britain, constructed, king's road connecting st. augustine to georgia)\n- (king's road, crosses, st. johns river at cow ford)\n- (cow ford, used_for, cattle crossing)\n- (cattle, brought_across, st. johns river at wacca pilatka)\n- (britain, introduced, agriculture including sugar cane indigo and fruits)\n- (britain, engaged_in, lumber export)\n- (britain, ceded_territory_back_to, spain in 1783 after defeat in american revolutionary war)\n- (spain, received_control_of, florida from britain in 1783)\n- (spain, ceded_florida_to, united states in 1821)\n- (jacksonville, named_after, andrew jackson)\n- (andrew jackson, associated_with, jacksonville naming)\n- (florida legislative council, approved_charter_for_town_government_on, february 9,1832)\n- (el cl\u00e1sico, game_between, barcelona and real madrid)\n- (catalonia, represented_by, barcelona)\n- (castile, represented_by, real madrid)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus.

According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC).

In practice, the roster had become dominated by the mid-1970s with releases of the former Beatles as solo artists.

The senior uniformed leadership in the Air Staff is made up of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 2 independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats. Republicans regained control of the chamber they had lost in the 2006 midterm elections, picking up a net total of 63 seats and erasing the gains Democrats made in 2006 and 2008. Although the sitting U.S. President's party usually loses seats in a midterm election, the 2010 election resulted in the highest loss of a party in a House midterm election since 1938, and the largest House swing since 1948. This also happened to be the Republicans' largest gain in House seats since 1938. Republicans gained the most in New York state where they picked up six seats, defeating five incumbents and winning an open Democratic district. The heavy Democratic Party losses were attributed to anger with President Obama, opposition to the Affordable Care Act, large budget deficits and the weak economy.

Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought. Wittenberg is a district () in the east of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fla\u0308ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church.

Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his Christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety.\" Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the \"Papists\" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Jean Hengen (23 November 1912 \u2013 29 January 2005) was a Luxembourgian prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (luther, held_belief, perpetual virginity of mary)\n- (luther, believed_in, theotokos or mother of god)\n- (luther, maintained, sinlessness of mary)\n- (assumption of mary, understood_fact, early in luther's life)\n- (luther, preached_taught_argued_about, veneration of mary)\n- (perpetual virginity of mary, asserted_by, luther three hundred years before dogmatization)\n- (sinlessness of mary, maintained_by, luther)\n- (immaculate conception, dogmatized_by, pope pius ix in 1854)\n- (luther, views_linked_to, christocentric theology)\n- (luther, criticized, papists for idolatry)\n- (veneration of mary, linked_to, liturgy and pietism)\n- (papists, blurred_line_between, admiration of grace and service to other creatures)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Written by Grande, Savan Kotecha and its producers Max Martin and Ilya, it was released by Republic Records as the album's lead single on April 20, 2018, alongside its music video. Commercially, the song has topped the charts in Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, Norway, Portugal, Serbia, Singapore, and Slovakia and reached the top five in Austria, Canada, Germany, Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. The music video was filmed in early January 2015 and it also stars Matt Bennett, who was also Grande's co-star from the Nickelodeon sitcom Victorious. Max Landis also confirmed that one of the voices of the news reporters in the beginning of the video was actress Elizabeth Gillies, who also co-starred in Victorious with Grande and Bennett. Gillies previously appeared Grande's music video for her single ``Right There ''(2013). Around that time, Max Landis revealed`` One Last Time'' as Grande's next single after tweeting, ``Earth will pass catastrophically through the tail of the comet Eurydice in one week. Gather family and lovers close, one... last... time ''. The lyric video for`` One Last Time'' was released on Grande's official Vevo on February 6, 2015, at the same time it was announced that the music video was finished.

He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes wavelength and amplitude. This phenomenon, subsequently known as Raman scattering, results from the Raman effect. In 1954, the Indian government honoured him with India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. A.P.J.

Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River. The southern border is defined as the 36\u00b0 30\u2032 parallel north, though surveyor error led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes. The border with Tennessee was not settled until 1893, when their dispute was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court. Newport News is included in the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. It is at the southeastern end of the Virginia Peninsula, on the northern shore of the James River extending southeast from Skiffe's Creek along many miles of waterfront to the river's mouth at Newport News Point on the harbor of Hampton Roads. The area now known as Newport News was once a part of Warwick County. Warwick County was one of the eight original shires of Virginia, formed by the House of Burgesses in the British Colony of Virginia by order of King Charles I in 1634. The county was largely composed of farms and undeveloped land until almost 250 years later. An Atlantic hurricane or tropical storm is a tropical cyclone that forms in the Atlantic Ocean, usually in the summer or fall. A hurricane differs from a cyclone or typhoon only on the basis of location.

It consists of linked stories featuring Timothy Cone, who works as a hard-boiled type investigator. He is a scruffy character, rough of mouth and demeanor but pure of heart. Cone has trouble with relationships, surviving on a rough-edged on-going affair with his supervisor, and an only slightly softer relationship with his cat Cleo. The stories in the book deal with his successful attempts to find out the truth and put villains behind bars. The Anderson Tapes is the debut crime fiction novel by Lawrence Sanders, published in 1970. The story revolves around the complicated burglary of an entire upscale New York apartment building by a gang of ex-convicts, who are unaware that the entire operation is under wiretap and camera surveillance by various agencies. The story also introduces the character of NYPD police detective Edward X. Delaney who became Sander's enduring protagonist in his \"Deadly Sin\" series of novels. The book earned Sanders the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for best first mystery novel. The same year, it was adapted into a film, directed by Sidney Lumet, with Sean Connery in the title role.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the timothy files, consists_of, linked stories)\n- (linked stories, featuring, timothy cone as hard-boiled type investigator with rough demeanor but pure heart)\n- (timothy cone, has_job_role, hard-boiled type investigator)\n- (timothy cone, has_demeanor, scruffy, rough mouth and demeanor but pure heart)\n- (timothy cone, has_personal_issue, trouble with relationships)\n- (timothy cone, has_supervisor, supervisor in ongoing affair)\n- (cleo, provides_companionship_to, timothy cone bridging personal life and professional life through shared experiences)\n- (the anderson tapes, introduces, nypd police detective edward x. delaney as enduring protagonist)\n- (e. c. r. larrick, writes, the anderson tapes published in 1970)\n- (the anderson tapes, includes_event, burglary of entire upscale new york apartment building)\n- (gang of ex convicts, perpetrate, burglary of entire upscale new york apartment building)\n- (the anderson tapes, uses_security_measure, wiretap and camera surveillance)\n- (nypd police detective edward x. delaney, is_character_in, the anderson tapes)\n- (e. c. r. larrick, writes, \"deadly sin\" series featuring edward x. delaney in multiple novels)\n- (\"deadly sin\" series, features_enduring_protagonist, nypd police detective edward x. delaney)\n- (\"deadly sin\" series, wins_award, mystery writers of america edgar award for best first mystery novel in 1970)\n- (mystery writers of america edgar award for best first mystery novel, awarded_to, \"deadly sin\" series)\n- (\"deadly sin\" series, has_media_type, film adaptation)\n- (film adaptation of, \"deadly sin\" series directed_by, sidney lumet)\n- (film adaptation of, \"deadly sin\" series starring, sean connery)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. A Doi is a village in south-eastern Laos near the border with Vietnam. It is located in Kaleum District in Sekong Province. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years.

In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000\u201324,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m (390 ft) lower than today. Hamburg is at a sheltered natural harbour on the southern fanning-out of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the northeast. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille.

One private CBC affiliate, CHBC-TV in Kelowna, joined E! (then known as CH) on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest O&O station to ensure that CBC service is continued. However, due to an agreement between CHBC and CFJC-TV in Kamloops, CFJC also disaffiliated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. Former private CBC affiliates CKPG-TV Prince George and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat disaffiliated on August 31, 2008 and joined E!, but the CBC announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas. Incidentally, CFJC, CKPG and CHAT are all owned by an independent media company, Jim Pattison Group. With the closure of E! and other changes in the media landscape, several former CBC affiliates have since joined City or Global, or closed altogether. Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself. CBC O&O stations operate as a mostly seamless national service with few deviations from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's CBLT, do not ID themselves at all except through PSIP).\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (chbc-tv, purchased_by, cbc program)\n- (cbc program, has_amount, 1 unit for chbc-tv in kelowna)\n- (chbc-tv, joined, e! on february 27, 2006)\n- (cfjc-tv in kamloops, purchased_by, canwest global or chum limited program)\n- (canwest global or chum limited program, has_amount, 1 unit for cfjc-tv in kamloops)\n- (cfjc-tv in kamloops, disaffiliated_from, cbc on february 27, 2006)\n- (ckpg-tv, purchased_by, canwest global or chum limited program)\n- (canwest global or chum limited program, has_amount, 1 unit for ckpg-tv prince george)\n- (chat-tv medicine hat, purchased_by, canwest global or chum limited program)\n- (canwest global or chum limited program, has_amount, 1 unit for chat-tv medicine hat)\n- (chat-tv medicine hat, joined, e! on august 31, 2008)\n- (cbc, announced, ceased adding retransmitters in areas where affiliates have left)\n- (cbc o&o stations, owned_and_operated_by, cbc itself program)\n- (cbc itself program, has_amount, multiple units for cbc o&o stations)\n- (cbc o&o stations, operate_as, mostly seamless national service)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty. Khong is a district (\"muang\") of Champassack Province in southwestern Laos. The district borders Cambodia in the far south and is famous for the Khonephapheng Waterfalls and the Si Phan Don (4000 Islands) area.

The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.

The remaining states are among the smallest in the U.S., including the smallest state -- Rhode Island. This is a list of the sixteen counties in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster - Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed. The Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood. The book was originally published in 1985.

Most inhabitants of Zhejiang speak Wu, but the Wu dialects are very diverse, especially in the south, where one valley may speak a dialect completely unintelligible to the next valley a few kilometers away. Other varieties of Chinese are spoken as well, mostly along the borders; Mandarin and Huizhou dialects are spoken on the border with Anhui, while Min dialects are spoken on the border with Fujian.

Richard and a small force of little more than 2,000 men went to Jaffa by sea in a surprise attack. Richard's forces stormed Jaffa from their ships and the Ayyubids, who had been unprepared for a naval attack, were driven from the city. Richard freed those of the Crusader garrison who had been made prisoner, and these troops helped to reinforce the numbers of his army. Saladin's army still had numerical superiority, however, and they counter-attacked. Saladin intended a stealthy surprise attack at dawn, but his forces were discovered; he proceeded with his attack, but his men were lightly armoured and lost 700 men killed due to the missiles of the large numbers of Crusader crossbowmen. The battle to retake Jaffa ended in complete failure for Saladin, who was forced to retreat. This battle greatly strengthened the position of the coastal Crusader states.On 2 September 1192, following his defeat at Jaffa, Saladin was forced to finalize a treaty with Richard providing that Jerusalem would remain under Muslim control, while allowing unarmed Christian pilgrims and traders to visit the city. Ascalon was a contentious issue as it threatened communication between Saladin's dominions in Egypt and Syria; it was eventually agreed that Ascalon, with its defences demolished, be returned to Saladin's control. Richard departed the Holy Land on 9 October 1192. Henry the Young King fought a short war with his brother Richard in 1183 over the status of England, Normandy and Aquitaine.

The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela hot plugged a USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.\" Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (microsoft windows, announced_by, bill gates)\n- (microsoft, introduced_operating_system, windows)\n- (windows, evolved_into, modern operating system)\n- (windows 98 release, preceded_by, press demonstration comdex april 1998)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

When Jason entered Iolcus, he was announced as a man wearing one sandal. Fearful, Pelias asked Jason what he would do if confronted with the man who would be his downfall. Jason responded that he would send that man after the Golden Fleece. Pelias took Jason's advice and sent him to retrieve the Golden Fleece. It would be found at Colchis, in a grove sacred to Ares, the god of war. Though the Golden Fleece simply hung on an oak tree, this was a seemingly impossible task, as an ever - watchful dragon guarded it. During Jason's absence, Pelias intended to kill Aeson.

On 27 June 1950, two days after the KPA invaded and three months before the Chinese entered the war, President Truman dispatched the United States Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait, to prevent hostilities between the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \"American aggression in the guise of the UN\". Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution. Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (autograph, achieved_success_in, ussr program)\n- (ussr program, supports, autograph's international recognition)\n- (autograph, performed_touring_in, 30+ countries program)\n- (30+ countries program, achieved, commercial success in west)\n- (autograph, participated_at, live aid concert program)\n- (live aid concert program, represented, eastern europe)\n- (president truman, dispatched_fleet_to, taiwan strait program)\n- (taiwan strait program, prevented_hostilities_between, nationalist republic of china and prc)\n- (un aggression, justified_by, american aggression in the guise of un)\n- (mao zedong, reported_to, politburo program)\n- (politburo program, decided_intervention_when, pla force reorganized)\n- (intervention program, responded_to, american aggression)\n- (american aggression, justified_by, un invasion of taiwan aborted on august 4,1950)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government.

He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ``the predominant feature of Saudi culture '', with its global spread largely financed by the oil and gas trade. Saudi Arabia is sometimes called`` the Land of the Two Holy Mosques'' in reference to Al - Masjid al - Haram (in Mecca) and Al - Masjid an - Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam. As of 2013, the state had a total population of 28.7 million, of which 20 million were Saudi nationals and 8 million were foreigners. As of 2017, the population is 33 million. The state's official language is Arabic. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen.

In 2007, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates stated that IPTV on Xbox 360 was expected to be available to consumers by the holiday season, using the Microsoft TV IPTV Edition platform. In 2008, Gates and president of Entertainment & Devices Robbie Bach announced a partnership with BT in the United Kingdom, in which the BT Vision advanced TV service, using the newer Microsoft Mediaroom IPTV platform, would be accessible via Xbox 360, planned for the middle of the year. BT Vision's DVR-based features would not be available on Xbox 360 due to limited hard drive capacity. In 2010, while announcing version 2.0 of Microsoft Mediaroom, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer mentioned that AT&T's U-verse IPTV service would enable Xbox 360s to be used as set-top boxes later in the year. As of January 2010, IPTV on Xbox 360 has yet to be deployed beyond limited trials. The release of Windows 98 was preceded by a notable press demonstration at COMDEX in April 1998. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela hot plugged a USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.\" Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (microsoft, announced_program, iptv services for xbox 360 program)\n- (iptv services for xbox 360 program, has_amount, no specific amount)\n- (iptv services for xbox 360 program, targets, 2007 consumer electronics shows)\n- (bill gates, announced_program, iptv services for xbox 360 program)\n- (iptv services for xbox 360 program, expected_by, 2007 holiday season)\n- (2007 holiday season, context_for, iptv services for xbox 360 program)\n- (gates and bach, announced_program, partnership with bt in the uk program)\n- (partnership with bt in the uk program, has_amount, no specific amount)\n- (partnership with bt in the uk program, targets, 2008 consumer electronics shows)\n- (bt in the uk, partnered_with, partnership with bt in the uk program)\n- (partnership with bt in the uk program, limited_by, limited hard drive capacity constraint)\n- (limited hard drive capacity, constraint_for, bt vision's dvr-based features)\n- (at&t's u-verse iptv service, enabled_feature, xbox 360 as set-top box by steve ballmer)\n- (steve ballmer, mentioned_service, at&t's u-verse iptv service)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Armenians enjoyed a period of relative stability under Soviet rule. They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The situation was difficult for the church, which struggled under Soviet rule. After the death of Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin took the reins of power and began an era of renewed fear and terror for Armenians. In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German\u2013Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition Nazi\u2013Soviet Relations (1948), Stalin published Falsifiers of History, which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world, without mentioning the Soviet offer to join the Axis. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution. A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left - leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (``Ones of the Majority '') led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the tsfsr, was_divided_into, armenian ssr, azerbaijan ssr, georgian ssr)\n- (armenian ssr, existed_under, soviet rule)\n- (azerbaijan ssr, existed_under, soviet rule)\n- (georgian ssr, existed_under, soviet rule)\n- (soviet rule, provided_support_to, armenians)\n- (support from moscow, included, medicine)\n- (support from moscow, included, food)\n- (support from moscow, included, provisions)\n- (communist rule, contrasted_with, turbulent final years of the ottoman empire)\n- (death of vladimir lenin, led_to, joseph stalin taking power)\n- (joseph stalin, initiated, era of fear and terror for armenians)\n- (stalin, published, falsifiers of history)\n- (dual power period, involved, provisional government holding state power)\n- (provisional government, had, allegiance from lower classes and urban middle class)\n- (soviets led by socialists, had, allegiance from lower classes and urban middle class)\n- (period of dual power, was_characterized_by, frequent mutinies)\n- (period of dual power, was_characterized_by, protests)\n- (period of dual power, was_characterized_by, strikes)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930. On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road Massacre. Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River. Most PLO fighters withdrew, but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over. The PLO soon resumed its policy of attacks against Israel. In the next few years, the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a country situated in Southwest Asia, the largest country of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, north of Yemen. Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (al saud, emerged_as, minor tribal rulers in najd)\n- (najd, located_in, central arabia)\n- (al saud, imbued_with, religious zeal of wahhabi islamic movement)\n- (wahhabi islamic movement, is_a, religious movement)\n- (abdulaziz, carried_out, series of wars of conquest between 1902 and 1927)\n- (abdulaziz, leading_to, establishment of kingdom of saudi arabia)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy (s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms -- instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite -- or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit.

Unlike Leo XIII, who addressed the condition of workers, Pius XI discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order. He describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism, socialism, and totalitarian communism. He also calls for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. The name Vatican city was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city - state. The name is taken from Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state. ``Vatican ''is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden, located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager,`` Vatican territory''. The flag of Vatican City was adopted on June 7, 1929, the year Pope Pius XI signed the Lateran Treaty with Italy, creating a new independent state governed by the Holy See. The Vatican flag is modeled on the 1808 yellow and white flag of the earlier Papal States, to which a papal tiara and keys were later added.

The game featured the sponsorship of the Reebok Pump shoe. During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the system\u2014the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's \"Ultra Games\" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (Japanese: \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d2\u309a\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf, Hepburn: Famiri\u0304 Konpyu\u0304ta?) (also known by the portmanteau abbreviation Famicom (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3, Famikon?) and abbreviated as FC) on July 15, 1983, and was later released in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986, and Australia in 1987. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy (\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u1103\u1162 \u110f\u1165\u11b7\u1107\u1169\u110b\u1175 Hyeondae Keomboi) and was distributed by SK Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart placed it in his 1787 work Don Giovanni and Beethoven created four variations of it. Antonio Maria Bononcini composed La conquista delle Spagne di Scipione Africano il giovane in 1707 and George Frideric Handel composed Alexander Balus in 1748. Others include Giovani Battista Gervasio (Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), Giuseppe Giuliano (Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), Emanuele Barbella (Sonata in D major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), Domenico Scarlatti (Sonata n.54 (K.89) in D minor for Mandolin and Basso Continuo), and Addiego Guerra (Sonata in G major for Mandolin and Basso Continuo). Orlando furioso RV 819 (, Teatro San Angelo, Venice 1714) is a three-act opera surviving in manuscript in Antonio Vivaldi's personal library, only partly related to his better known Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727. It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population.

Historically, the party has supported a higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism than it has in recent decades. However, from its foundation the party has identified itself as anti-socialist. Strong opposition to socialism and communism in Australia and abroad was one of its founding principles. The party's founder and longest-serving leader Robert Menzies envisaged that Australia's middle class would form its main constituency. The UAP had been formed as a new conservative alliance in 1931, with Labor defector Joseph Lyons as its leader. The stance of Lyons and other Labor rebels against the more radical proposals of the Labor movement to deal the Great Depression had attracted the support of prominent Australian conservatives. With Australia still suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the newly formed party won a landslide victory at the 1931 Election, and the Lyons Government went on to win three consecutive elections. It largely avoided Keynesian pump-priming and pursued a more conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets as a means of stewarding Australia out of the Depression. Lyons' death in 1939 saw Robert Menzies assume the Prime Ministership on the eve of war. Menzies served as Prime Minister from 1939 to 1941 but resigned as leader of the minority World War II government amidst an unworkable parliamentary majority. The UAP, led by Billy Hughes, disintegrated after suffering a heavy defeat in the 1943 election.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (contemporary liberal party, supports, economic liberalism)\n- (contemporary liberal party, supported, higher degree of economic protectionism and interventionism in past than present)\n- (contemporary liberal party, identified as, anti-socialist foundational principle)\n- (strong opposition to socialism and communism, was one of, founding principles of the party)\n- (uap, formed as, new conservative alliance in 1931)\n- (uap, led by, joseph lyons after defecting from labor)\n- (lyons and other labor rebels, opposed, more radical proposals to deal with great depression)\n- (support for stance against labor movement's proposals, attracted, prominent australian conservatives)\n- (uap, won, landslide victory at 1931 election due to opposition to labor's proposals)\n- (lyons government, won, three consecutive elections after 1931 election)\n- (lyons government, pursued, conservative fiscal policy of debt reduction and balanced budgets during great depression)\n- (lyons' death in 1939, saw, robert menzies assume prime ministership on eve of war)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia. Because of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, anti-Communist governments. For example, Yugoslavia was the only communist country allowed to have an embassy in Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay. One notable exception to Yugoslavia's neutral stance toward anti-communist countries was Chile under Pinochet; Yugoslavia was one of many countries which severed diplomatic relations with Chile after Salvador Allende was overthrown. Yugoslavia also provided military aid and arms supplies to staunchly anti-Communist regimes such as that of Guatemala under Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garci\u0301a. Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President. Since the Militia Act of 1903 all National Guard soldiers have held dual status: as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and, when activated, as a reserve of the U.S. Army under the authority of the President.

The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City; the other club is the National League (NL)'s New York Mets. In the season, the club began play in the AL as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise that had ceased operations and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders. The Highlanders were officially renamed the Yankees in . Major League Baseball had most of its teams open the 2011 season on a Thursday (March 31) or Friday (April 1) rather than the traditional Monday, in order to prevent the World Series from extending into November. Similarly, most teams opened the 2012 season on Thursday (April 5) or Friday (April 6). However, subsequent seasons through 2017 returned to Monday openers for most teams. For the 2018 season, all 30 teams were scheduled to open the season on Thursday, March 29 (the earliest domestic start for a regular season in MLB history, and the first time since 1968 that all major league teams were scheduled to start the season on the same day, although two games were subsequently rained out and postponed to Friday, March 30). In the American League, the New York Yankees have played in 40 World Series and won 27, the Philadelphia / Kansas City / Oakland Athletics have played in 14 and won 9, and the Boston Red Sox have played in 12 and won 8, including the first World Series.

According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure. For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up - front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the Journal, received a ``chilly ''response from those involved. NFL is a 1989 football video game, developed by Atlus and published by LJN exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System. To compete with the popular Family Computer in Japan, NEC Home Electronics launched the PC Engine in 1987, and Sega Enterprises followed suit with the Mega Drive in 1988. The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping.

At its height, the Pinkerton Agency's numbers exceeded those of the United States Army.[citation needed] Because of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, anti-Communist governments. For example, Yugoslavia was the only communist country allowed to have an embassy in Alfredo Stroessner's Paraguay. One notable exception to Yugoslavia's neutral stance toward anti-communist countries was Chile under Pinochet; Yugoslavia was one of many countries which severed diplomatic relations with Chile after Salvador Allende was overthrown. Yugoslavia also provided military aid and arms supplies to staunchly anti-Communist regimes such as that of Guatemala under Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garci\u0301a. Several accomplished professional tennis players including Ivan Lendl, Jan Kodes\u030c, Miloslav Mec\u030ci\u0301r\u030c, Hana Mandli\u0301kova\u0301, Martina Hingis, Martina Navratilova, Jana Novotna, Petra Kvitova\u0301 and Daniela Hantuchova\u0301 were born in Czechoslovakia. In 1968, Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubc\u030cek to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubc\u030cek needed help in facing down the Soviets. In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (american old west, has_program, army policing program)\n- (army policing program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (american old west, has_program, sheriff law enforcement program)\n- (sheriff law enforcement program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (american old west, has_program, posse temporary law enforcement program)\n- (posse temporary law enforcement program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (american old west, has_program, public organization and private contractor supplementing policing efforts program)\n- (public organization and private contractor supplementing policing efforts program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (pinkerton national detective agency, has_program, security services provision program)\n- (security services provision program, has_amount, personnel count exceeding united states army at its height)\n- (yugoslavia, maintains_diplomatic_relations_with, right-wing anti-communist governments)\n- (right-wing anti-communist governments, maintain_diplomatic_relations_with, yugoslavia)\n- (paraguay, allows_embassy_of, communist country)\n- (alfredo stroessner's paraguay, allows_embassy_of, yugoslavia)\n- (yugoslavia, sever_diplomatic_relations_with, chile)\n- (chile, sever_diplomatic_relations_with, yugoslavia after salvador allende's overthrow)\n- (yugoslavia, provides_military_aid_and_armssupplies_to, guatemala under kjell eugenio laugerud garci\u0301a\u2019s leadership)\n- (czechoslovakia, has_program, professional tennis players birthplace program)\n- (professional tennis players birthplace program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (tito, offers_emergency_travel_to, alexander dubc\u030cek in prague)\n- (alexander dubc\u030cek, receives_emergency_travel_from, tito with three hours notice if needed for emergencies)\n- (yugoslavia, removes_generals, ivan gos\u030cnjak and rade hamovic\u0301 due to unpreparedness of the yugoslav army in april 1969)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Like the Dyna and its twin Toyoace, the Dutro is built on the U300 platform for standard cab, or U400 platform for the wide cab and offered in many different chassis type suitable for different purposes. The Dutro took over from the earlier Ranger 2 (and Ranger 3), a badge-engineered version of Daihatsu's Delta series. Outside of Japan, it is also known as the '300 series'. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (facelift design, designed, late 2010)\n- (facelift patent, patented, 7 january 2011)\n- (facelift design registration number, includes, 001845801 - 0004)\n- (facelift unveiling, unveiled, march 2012 geneva motor show)\n- (new wheels, introduced with, facelift)\n- (interior colors, changed with, facelift)\n- (new head and tail lamps, introduced with, facelift)\n- (new grilles, introduced with, facelift)\n- (new led running lights, introduced with, facelift)\n- (f sport introduction, introduced, facelift)\n- (f sport grille type, has, honeycomb grille)\n- (f sport transmission, comes with, 8-speed automatic transmission)\n- (f sport interior, has, unique sporty interior)\n- (rx 350 sales start, began worldwide, april 2012)\n- (rx 450h sales start, began worldwide, april 2012)\n- (f-sport variants sales start, for, july 2012)\n- (hino dutro shared with, shared with, toyota dyna)\n- (hino motors manufacture, manufactures, hino dutro)\n- (hino dutro platform u300 built on, built on, standard cab)\n- (hino dutro platform u400 built on, built on, wide cab)\n- (hino dutro successor, took over from, ranger 2 and ranger 3)\n- (ranger 2 and ranger 3 badge-engineered versions of, badge-engineered versions of, daihatsu's delta series)\n- (hino dutro name variation, also known as, '300 series' outside japan)\n- (toyota corona mark ii introduction, introduced by, toyota)\n- (toyota cressida introduction, introduced by, toyota)\n- (mazda 616 introduction, introduced by, mazda)\n- (datsun 810 introduction, introduced by, nissan (then datsun))\n- (new cars passenger space and amenities added, such as, air conditioning, power steering, am-fm radios, power windows, central locking without increasing prices)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. As in most of eastern China the ethnic makeup of Nanjing is predominantly Han nationality (98.56 percent), with 50 other minority nationalities. In 1999, 77,394 residents belonged to minority nationalities, among which the vast majority (64,832) were Hui nationalities, contributing 83.76 percent to the minority population. The second and third largest minority groups were Manchu (2,311) and Zhuang (533) nationalities. Most of the minority nationalities resided in Jianye District, comprising 9.13 percent of the district's population. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435\u20131449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court.

The BBWAA began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938, reducing that number to two per league city in 1961. The BBWAA does not offer a clear - cut definition of what ``most valuable ''means, instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters. Other legendary home run hitters include Jimmie Foxx, Mel Ott, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle (who on September 10, 1960, mythically hit ``the longest home run ever ''at an estimated distance of 643 feet (196 m), although this was measured after the ball stopped rolling), Reggie Jackson, Harmon Killebrew, Ernie Banks, Mike Schmidt, Dave Kingman, Sammy Sosa (who hit 60 or more home runs in a season 3 times), Ken Griffey, Jr. and Eddie Mathews. In 1987, Joey Meyer of the Denver Zephyrs hit the longest verifiable home run in professional baseball history.

Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire. Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his queen consort. Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon de Montfort. John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons \u2013 Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip \u2013 and three daughters \u2013 Joan, Maud and probably Isabel. Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales. Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the abbey. In 1216, Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne, because the French prince Louis had taken control of the city, and so the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral. This coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the abbey on 17 May 1220. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the traditional cleric in the coronation ceremony.[citation needed]\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (john, has_wife, isabel)\n- (isabel, countess_of_gloucester, released from imprisonment in 1214)\n- (isabel, countess_of_gloucester, remarried twice)\n- (isabel of angouleme, left_england_for_angouleme, soon after the king's death)\n- (henry iii, ruled_as_king, for majority of the 13th century)\n- (joan, married_alexander_ii_of_scotland, became his queen consort)\n- (john, had_five_legitimate_children, by isabella)\n- (eleanor, married_william_marshal's_son, also called william)\n- (john, had_nine_sons, richard, oliver, john, geoffrey, henry, osbert gifford, eudes, bartholomew, probably philip)\n- (john, had_three_daughters, joan, maud, probably isabel)\n- (coronations of english and british monarchs, held_in_abbey_since, 1066)\n- (henry iii, unable_to_be_crowned_in_london_when_first_came_to_throne, in 1216 due to french prince louis taking control of city)\n- (henry iii, was_crowned_in_gloucester_cathedral, in 1216)\n- (henry iii, further_coronation_held_in_abbey, on 17 may 1220)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

Gilmer, Atlanta did indeed become the target of a major Union invasion. The area now covered by metropolitan Atlanta was the scene of several fiercely contested battles, including the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, Battle of Ezra Church and the Battle of Jonesboro. On September 1, 1864, Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood evacuated Atlanta, after a five - week siege mounted by Union Gen. William Sherman, and ordered all public buildings and possible Confederate assets destroyed. The city's population in 2010 was 44% white (33.3% non-Hispanic white), 25.5% black (23% non-Hispanic black), 0.7% Native American, and 12.7% Asian. Hispanics of any race represented 28.6% of the population, while Asians constituted the fastest-growing segment of the city's population between 2000 and 2010; the non-Hispanic white population declined 3 percent, the smallest recorded decline in decades; and for the first time since the Civil War, the number of blacks declined over a decade.

Before the merger of the defunct American Basketball Association with the NBA during the 1976 -- 1977 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home stadium (Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two - time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward Julius Erving. During the first season of the merger (1976 -- 77), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012 -- 2013 NBA season.

Because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the British, the United States compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties, and began dividing these lands for settlement. This provoked a war in the Northwest Territory in which the U.S. forces performed poorly; the Battle of the Wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the United States at the hands of American Indians. President Washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region, which decisively defeated the Indian confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794. The Minikahda Club is a golf club and course located in southwest Minneapolis, Minnesota, just west of Lake Calhoun. The course hosted the U.S. Open in 1916, the U.S. Amateur in 1927, and the Walker Cup in 1957. Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle.

Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal.

Whilst the entire site on which the silver - domed mosque sits, along with the Dome of the Rock, seventeen gates, and four minarets, was itself historically known as the Al - Aqsa Mosque, today a narrower definition prevails, and the wider compound is usually referred to as al - Haram ash - Sharif (`` the Noble Sanctuary''), or the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to al - Aqsa during the Night Journey. Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the seventeenth month after the emigration, when God directed him to turn towards the Kaaba.

But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly larger than the Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report on religion and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3 percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8 percent was Muslim, and 1.9 percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5 percent of the total population is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5 percent, and that 7.7 percent are members of other religious groups. The Armenians collective has, at times, constituted a Christian \"island\" in a mostly Muslim region. There is, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as Hamshenis but many Armenians view them as a separate race, while the history of the Jews in Armenia dates back 2,000 years. The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States. Later on, the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin, the original seat of the Catholicosate. In 1441, a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi, while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia.

This weather effect occurs anywhere from once to several times a year, mostly in summer but sometimes in winter. The resulting wind typically creates large sandstorms that impact Iraq, most sand having been picked up from Jordan and Syria.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. The area of modern - day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of four distinct regions: Hejaz, Najd and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al - Ahsa) and Southern Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by Ibn Saud. He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, effectively a hereditary dictatorship governed along Islamic lines. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been called ``the predominant feature of Saudi culture '', with its global spread largely financed by the oil and gas trade.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, is_located_in, southwest asia)\n- (persian gulf, borders, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (red sea, borders, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, occupies_80_percent_of, arabian peninsula)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_boundary_with, united arab emirates)\n- (united arab emirates, has_boundary_with, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, has_boundary_with, oman)\n- (oman, has_boundary_with, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (republic of yemen, has_boundary_with, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, government_estimate, 2217949 square kilometres)\n- (2217949 square kilometres, is_estimated_area_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (2149690 square kilometres, is_reputable_estimate_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (2240000 square kilometres, is_reputable_estimate_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, less_than_1_percent_suitable_for_cultivation, 2217949 square kilometres)\n- (eastern coastal areas, population_distribution, varied in early 1990s)\n- (western coastal areas, population_distribution, varied in early 1990s)\n- (interior oases, population_distribution, varied in early 1990s)\n- (vast deserts, population_distribution, varied in early 1990s)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, formerly_consisted_of_four_regions, hejaz)\n- (hejaz, part_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, formerly_consisted_of_four_regions, najd)\n- (najd, part_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, formerly_consisted_of_four_regions, eastern arabia al-ahsa)\n- (eastern arabia al-ahsa, part_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, formerly_consisted_of_four_regions, southern arabia asir)\n- (southern arabia asir, part_of, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (kingdom of saudi arabia, founded_in_1932_by, ibn saud)\n- (ibn saud, united_four_regions_into_single_state, 1932)\n- (absolute monarchy, is_form_of_government_for, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (hereditary dictatorship, is_form_of_government_for, kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (islamic lines, governs, absolute monarchy in kingdom of saudi arabia)\n- (wahhabi religious movement, predominant_feature_of, saudi culture)\n- (sunni islam, practiced_in, saudi culture)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Barclays Center in Brooklyn is home to the Brooklyn Nets NBA basketball team. The Nets began playing in Brooklyn in 2012, the first major professional sports team to play in the historic borough in half a century. Before the merger of the defunct American Basketball Association with the NBA during the 1976 -- 1977 season, the New York Nets, who shared the same home stadium (Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum) on Long Island with the NHL's New York Islanders, were a two - time champion in the ABA and starred the famous Hall of Fame forward Julius Erving. During the first season of the merger (1976 -- 77), the Nets continued to play on Long Island, although Erving's contract had by then been sold to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Nets transferred to New Jersey then next season and became known as the New Jersey Nets, and later moved to Brooklyn prior to the 2012 -- 2013 NBA season. The 1976 Democratic National Convention met at Madison Square Garden in New York City, from July 12 to July 15, 1976. The assembled United States Democratic Party delegates at the convention nominated former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia for President and Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota for Vice President. John Glenn and Barbara Jordan gave the keynote addresses. Jordan's keynote address made her the first African-American woman to deliver the keynote address at a Democratic National Convention.

Immediately prior to the Holocaust, the number of Jews in the world stood at approximately 16.7 million. Statistical figures vary for the contemporary demography of Ashkenazi Jews, oscillating between 10 million and 11.2 million. Sergio DellaPergola in a rough calculation of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, implies that Ashkenazi make up less than 74% of Jews worldwide. Other estimates place Ashkenazi Jews as making up about 75% of Jews worldwide. Ashkenazi Jews represent the bulk of modern Jewry, with at least 70% of Jews worldwide (and up to 90% prior to World War II and the Holocaust). As a result of their emigration from Europe, Ashkenazim also represent the overwhelming majority of Jews in the New World continents, in countries such as the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and Brazil. In France, the immigration of Jews from Algeria (Sephardim) has led them to outnumber the Ashkenazim.

Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 2,320 miles (3,730 km) to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth - longest and fifteenth - largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Minikahda Club is a golf club and course located in southwest Minneapolis, Minnesota, just west of Lake Calhoun. The course hosted the U.S. Open in 1916, the U.S. Amateur in 1927, and the Walker Cup in 1957. Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River, just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River, and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with 13 lakes, wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls; many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway. It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber. The city and surrounding region is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle. As of 2018, Minneapolis was home to 6 Fortune 500 companies, and the Twin Cities were the fifth-largest hub of major corporate headquarters in the United States.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdam's population died in 1623\u201325, and again in 1635\u201336, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u201377 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348\u201350. The last plague outbreak ravaged Oslo in 1654. Scanderbeg (; RV 732) is an opera (\"dramma per musica\") in three acts composed by Antonio Vivaldi to an Italian libretto by Antonio Salvi. It was first performed at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence on 22 June 1718 to mark the re-opening of the theatre to public performances.

The population was 10,361 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Columbia, South Carolina, Metropolitan Statistical Area. Although the city lost the status of state capital to Columbia in 1786, Charleston became even more prosperous in the plantation-dominated economy of the post-Revolutionary years. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 revolutionized the processing of this crop, making short-staple cotton profitable. It was more easily grown in the upland areas, and cotton quickly became South Carolina's major export commodity. The Piedmont region was developed into cotton plantations, to which the sea islands and Lowcountry were already devoted. Slaves were also the primary labor force within the city, working as domestics, artisans, market workers, and laborers.

It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports, as well as separate power chargers for portable devices. A unit load is defined as 100 mA in USB 1.x and 2.0, and 150 mA in USB 3.0. A device may draw a maximum of five unit loads from a port in USB 1.x and 2.0 (500 mA), or six unit loads in USB 3.0 (900 mA). There are two types of devices: low-power and high-power. A low-power device (such as a USB HID) draws at most one-unit load, with minimum operating voltage of 4.4 V in USB 2.0, and 4 V in USB 3.0. A high-power device draws, at most, the maximum number of unit loads the standard permits. Every device functions initially as low-power (including high-power functions during their low-power enumeration phases), but may request high-power, and get it if available on the providing bus.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (usb, supports, connection of computer peripherals)\n- (usb, includes, earlier interfaces)\n- (usb, has_become_commonplace_on, other devices including computers)\n- (unit load program in usb 1 x and 2 0, has_amount, 5 unit loads)\n- (unit load program in usb 3 0, has_amount, 6 unit loads)\n- (device type, includes, low power device)\n- (device type, includes, high power device)\n- (low power device, draws_maximum, 1 unit load with minimum operating voltage of 4 4 v in usb 2 0 and 4 v in usb 3 0)\n- (high power device, draws_maximum, maximum number of unit loads standard permits)\n- (device, functions_initially_as, low power device)\n- (device, may_request_high_power, if available on providing bus)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Ban Kenpha is a village in Houaphanh Province, northeastern Laos. It is to the northeast of Vieng Kham, not far from Muang Xon. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

His mother, named Setareh, was from Bukhara; his father, Abdullah, was a respected Ismaili scholar from Balkh, an important town of the Samanid Empire, in what is today Balkh Province, Afghanistan, although this is not universally agreed upon. His father worked in the government of Samanid in the village Kharmasain, a Sunni regional power. After five years, his younger brother, Mahmoud, was born. Avicenna first began to learn the Quran and literature in such a way that when he was ten years old he had essentially learned all of them. Muslim physicians contributed to the field of medicine, including the subjects of anatomy and physiology: such as in the 15th century Persian work by Mansur ibn Muhammad ibn al-Faqih Ilyas entitled Tashrih al-badan (Anatomy of the body) which contained comprehensive diagrams of the body's structural, nervous and circulatory systems; or in the work of the Egyptian physician Ibn al-Nafis, who proposed the theory of pulmonary circulation. Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries.

Zun, a kind of wine vessel, was found to exist in Beiyinyangying culture of Nanjing in about 5000 years ago. In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.

Many aspects of her life and work remain very unclear, especially outside the period 1607 to 1621 from which period dated paintings are known. As Seymour Slive puts it \"Not a single uncontested document has surfaced about her life but there is reason to believe she was active in both Flanders and Holland.\" After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy. Many came from the region of the Ce\u0301vennes, for instance, the village of Fraissinet-de-Loze\u0300re. This was a huge influx as the entire population of the Dutch Republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. Around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Amsterdam population was Huguenot.[citation needed] In 1705, Amsterdam and the area of West Frisia were the first areas to provide full citizens rights to Huguenot immigrants, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1715.

It was used as the name of the Indus river and also referred to its tributaries. The actual term 'hindu' first occurs, states Gavin Flood, as ``a Persian geographical term for the people who lived beyond the river Indus (Sanskrit: Sindhu) '', more specifically in the 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I. The Punjab region, called Sapta Sindhava in the Vedas, is called Hapta Hindu in Zend Avesta. The 6th - century BCE inscription of Darius I mentions the province of Hi (n) dush, referring to northwestern India. The people of India were referred to as Hinduva\u0304n (Hindus) and hindavi\u0304 was used as the adjective for Indian in the 8th century text Chachnama. The term 'Hindu' in these ancient records is an ethno - geographical term and did not refer to a religion. The Arabic equivalent Al - Hind likewise referred to the country of India.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism. Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Proto-Elamite and Elamite kingdoms in 3200\u20132800 BC.

In the late period of Shang dynasty, Taibo of Zhou came to Jiangnan and established Wu state, and the first stop is in Nanjing area according to some historians based on discoveries in Taowu and Hushu culture. According to legend,[which?] Fuchai, King of the State of Wu, founded a fort named Yecheng (\u51b6\u57ce) in today's Nanjing area in 495 BC. Later in 473 BC, the State of Yue conquered Wu and constructed the fort of Yuecheng (\u8d8a\u57ce) on the outskirts of the present-day Zhonghua Gate. In 333 BC, after eliminating the State of Yue, the State of Chu built Jinling Yi (\u91d1\u9675\u9091) in the western part of present-day Nanjing. It was renamed Moling (\u79e3\u9675) during reign of Qin Shi Huang. Since then, the city experienced destruction and renewal many times.[citation needed] The area was successively part of Kuaiji, Zhang and Danyang prefectures in Qin and Han dynasty, and part of Yangzhou region which was established as the nation's 13 supervisory and administrative regions in the 5th year of Yuanfeng in Han dynasty (106 BC). Nanjing was later the capital city of Danyang Prefecture, and had been the capital city of Yangzhou for about 400 years from late Han to early Tang.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (the kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, region program in southwest asia)\n- (the kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, bordering persian gulf program)\n- (the kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, bordering red sea program)\n- (the kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, occupies arabian peninsula program with 80% context)\n- (the kingdom of saudi arabia, has_program, cultivation suitability program with less than 1% context)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

It lies along the Indian and Eurasian Plates, to the southeast of the Himalayas. To its west is the Bay of Bengal and to its south is the Andaman Sea. It is strategically located near major Indian Ocean shipping lanes. The discovery of new maritime trade routes by Western European states allowed them to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly. The Portuguese discovery of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 initiated a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. The Somali Muslim Ajuran Empire, allied with the Ottomans, defied the Portuguese economic monopoly in the Indian Ocean by employing a new coinage which followed the Ottoman pattern, thus proclaiming an attitude of economic independence in regard to the Portuguese. Muang Kasi is a river town in Vientiane Province, Laos. It is located to the north of Ban Thieng along Route 13. The Pathet Lao were active in Muang Kasi. The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper Tenasserim. The Restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features would continue well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley, and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (myanmar, lies_along, indian plate)\n- (myanmar, lies_along, eurasian plate)\n- (myanmar, west_of, bay of bengal)\n- (myanmar, south_of, andaman sea)\n- (myanmar, near, indian ocean shipping lanes)\n- (discovery of new maritime trade routes by western european states, allowed_avoidance_of, ottoman trade monopoly)\n- (portuguese discovery of cape of good hope in 1488, initiated, series of ottoman-portuguese naval wars in indian ocean)\n- (somali muslim ajuran empire, allied_with, ottomans)\n- (muang kasi, located_in, vientiane province, laos)\n- (pathet lao, active_in, muang kasi)\n- (toungoo dynasty, regrouped_and_defeated_portuguese, 1613)\n- (toungoo dynasty, defeated_siam, 1614)\n- (restored toungoo kings, created_legal_and_political_framework, continued into 19th century)\n- (restored toungoo kings, replaced, hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships, irrawaddy valley)\n- (restored toungoo kings, reduced, hereditary rights of shan chiefs)\n- (trade and secular administrative reforms, built, prosperous economy for more than 80 years)\n- (kingdom, faced_with, repeated meithei raids into upper myanmar from 1720s onward)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The term is used in Scholasticism for a \"renowned scholar\", and in biological taxonomy for the scientist describing a species or other taxon. The term is widely replaced by author in English-language works. Charlemagne's court in Aachen was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes referred to as the \"Carolingian Renaissance\". Literacy increased, as did development in the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, as well as liturgical and scriptural studies. The English monk Alcuin (d. 804) was invited to Aachen and brought the education available in the monasteries of Northumbria. Charlemagne's chancery\u2014or writing office\u2014made use of a new script today known as Carolingian minuscule,[M] allowing a common writing style that advanced communication across much of Europe. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy, imposing the Roman form of church service on his domains, as well as the Gregorian chant in liturgical music for the churches. An important activity for scholars during this period was the copying, correcting, and dissemination of basic works on religious and secular topics, with the aim of encouraging learning. New works on religious topics and schoolbooks were also produced. Grammarians of the period modified the Latin language, changing it from the Classical Latin of the Roman Empire into a more flexible form to fit the needs of the church and government. By the reign of Charlemagne, the language had so diverged from the classical that it was later called Medieval Latin. The migration-period peoples who later coalesced into a \"German\" ethnicity were the Germanic tribes of the Saxons, Franci, Thuringii, Alamanni and Bavarii.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (auctor (scholasticism), has_program, renowned scholar program)\n- (renowned scholar program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (renowned scholar program, targets, renowned scholars in scholasticism)\n- (auctor (taxonomy), has_program, scientist program)\n- (scientist program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (scientist program, targets, scientists describing species or taxa)\n- (charlemagne's court, has_program, carolingian renaissance program)\n- (carolingian renaissance program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (carolingian renaissance program, targets, cultural revival in aachen)\n- (alcuin (northumbria), has_program, education program)\n- (education program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (education program, targets, charlemagne's court in aachen)\n- (aachen (charlemagne's court), has_program, chancery program)\n- (chancery program, has_amount, use of carolingian minuscule)\n- (chancery program, targets, common writing style)\n- (carolingian minuscule, has_program, communication facilitation program)\n- (communication facilitation program, has_amount, across europe)\n- (communication facilitation program, targets, improved communication)\n- (charlemagne, has_program, liturgy change sponsorship program)\n- (liturgy change sponsorship program, has_amount, roman form of church service imposition)\n- (liturgy change sponsorship program, targets, domains including gregorian chant)\n- (roman form of church service, has_program, liturgical music program)\n- (liturgical music program, has_amount, gregorian chant inclusion)\n- (liturgical music program, targets, churches)\n- (scholars, has_program, activities engagement program)\n- (activities engagement program, has_amount, copying, correcting, disseminating basic works)\n- (activities engagement program, targets, religious and secular topics)\n- (basic works, has_program, production program)\n- (production program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (production program, targets, new works on religious topics)\n- (new works, has_program, creation program)\n- (creation program, has_amount, not specified)\n- (creation program, targets, schoolbooks)\n- (grammarians, has_program, latin language modification program)\n- (latin language modification program, has_amount, divergence from classical to medieval latin)\n- (latin language modification program, targets, church and government needs)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

On March 30, 2015, it was announced that West is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. Including Beyonce\u0301 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Rihanna, Beyonce\u0301, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (jay-z, wrote, song ) , ( song, includes, verses ) , ( jay-z, stated, the challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value ) , ( tidal, aims, rival other streaming services such as spotify ) , ( tidal, has program, march 30, 2015 program ) , ( march 30, 2015 program, targets, west co-owns tidal ) , ( jay-z, acquired, aspiro ) , ( aspiro, is parent of, tidal ) , ( sixteen artist stakeholders, co-owns, tidal ) , ( beyonc\u00e9, owns, 3% equity stake in tidal ) , ( jay-z, owns, 3% equity stake in tidal ) , ( idea for all artist-owned streaming service, created to adapt, increased demand for streaming in the music industry ) , ( spotify, has_issue, low payout of royalties)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

In 1968, Tito offered Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubc\u030cek to fly to Prague on three hours notice if Dubc\u030cek needed help in facing down the Soviets. In April 1969, Tito removed generals Ivan Gos\u030cnjak and Rade Hamovic\u0301 in the aftermath of the invasion of Czechoslovakia due to the unpreparedness of the Yugoslav army to respond to a similar invasion of Yugoslavia. Prague underground was an underground culture developed in Prague, Czechoslovakia in the late 1960s and 1970s during the Normalization period. The movement was characterized by resistance against conformity, conventions, and consumerism. Because of its non-conformity, it had serious problems with the communist regime which considered it as a political opposition. Currently, the army is divided into the Regular Army, the Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. The army is also divided into major branches such as Air Defense Artillery, Infantry, Aviation, Signal Corps, Corps of Engineers, and Armor. Before 1903 members of the National Guard were considered state soldiers unless federalized (i.e., activated) by the President. Since the Militia Act of 1903 all National Guard soldiers have held dual status: as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and, when activated, as a reserve of the U.S. Army under the authority of the President.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (slavs, were_mentioned_in, national anthem of slovak republic)\n- (slavs, were_mentioned_in, national anthem of yugoslavia)\n- (slavs, were_mentioned_in, national anthem of federal republic of yugoslavia)\n- (slavs, were_mentioned_in, national anthem of serbia and montenegro)\n- (tito, offered_help_to, alexander dub\u010dek)\n- (tito, context_of, 1968 events in czechoslovakia)\n- (normalization period, developed_response_to, communist regime policies in czechoslovakia)\n- (army reserve, evolved_into, army national guard under militia act 1903)\n- (army national guard, has_dual_status_with, regular army)\n- (air defense artillery, part_of, army structure)\n- (infantry, part_of, army structure)\n- (aviation, part_of, army structure)\n- (signal corps, part_of, army structure)\n- (corps of engineers, part_of, army structure)\n- (armor, part_of, army structure)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

He claims that the term \"operates as a catch-all to lump together disparate laws [which] originated separately, evolved differently, cover different activities, have different rules, and raise different public policy issues\" and that it creates a \"bias\" by confusing these monopolies with ownership of limited physical things, likening them to \"property rights\". Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. Defective by Design is an anti-DRM initiative by the Free Software Foundation. DRM technology, known as \"digital rights management\" technology by its supporters, restricts users' ability to freely use their purchased movies, music, literature, software, and hardware in ways they are accustomed to with ordinary non-restricted media (such as books and audio compact discs).

Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine remained an authoritative medical textbook in Europe until the 18th century. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (also known as Abulcasis) contributed to the discipline of medical surgery with his Kitab al-Tasrif (\"Book of Concessions\"), a medical encyclopedia which was later translated to Latin and used in European and Muslim medical schools for centuries. Other medical advancements came in the fields of pharmacology and pharmacy. Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as al-Tusi) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as al-Razi) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as al-Ghazali) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means.

The production altered some sand dunes and cleared some coconut trees and grass to widen the beach. Fox set aside a fund to reconstruct and return the beach to its natural state; however, lawsuits were filed by environmentalists who believed the damage to the ecosystem was permanent and restoration attempts had failed. Following shooting of the film, there was a clear flat area at one end of the beach that was created artificially with an odd layout of trees which was never rectified, and the entire area remained damaged from the original state until the tsunami of 2004.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control. Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist fac\u0327ade. Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government. Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (trotsky, believes_in, world revolution)\n- (trotsky, has_program, world revolution program)\n- (world revolution program, targets, world)\n- (others, believes_in, world revolution)\n- (others, has_program, world revolution program)\n- (lenin, writes_on, matter of revolution)\n- (lenin, has_program, theory of imperialism)\n- (theory of imperialism, declares, imperialism is highest stage of capitalism)\n- (stalin, establishes, socialism in one country for soviet union)\n- (stalin, has_program, socialism in one country program)\n- (socialism in one country program, targets, soviet union)\n- (stalin, creates_model_for, inward looking stalinist states)\n- (stalin, purges, early internationalist elements)\n- (new era begins with thaw, begins, late 1950s)\n- (khrushchev, pressures, soviet usa relations)\n- (khrushchev, starts, anti imperialist propaganda)\n- (speech at un conference in 1960, announces_continuation_of, anti imperialism)\n- (mao zedong, argues, soviet union became an imperialist power with socialist facade)\n- (sultan galiev, considers, soviet regime as renewed russian imperialism)\n- (vasyl shakhrai, considers, soviet regime as renewed russian imperialism)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His father, Vyacheslav or Cheslau Brodovitch, was a respected physician, psychiatrist and huntsman. His mother was an amateur painter. During the Russo-Japanese War, his family moved to Moscow, where his father worked in a hospital for Japanese prisoners. Alexey was sent to study at the Prince Tenisheff School, a prestigious institution in Saint Petersburg, with the intentions of eventually enrolling in the Imperial Art Academy. He had no formal training in art through his childhood, but often sketched noble profiles in the audience at concerts in the city. Poland's nobility were also more numerous than those of all other European countries, constituting some 10\u201312% of the total population of historic Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth also some 10\u201312% among ethnic Poles on ethnic Polish lands (part of Commonwealth), but up to 25% of all Poles worldwide (szlachta could dispose more of resources to travels and/or conquering), while in some poorer regions (e.g., Mazowsze, the area centred on Warsaw) nearly 30%.

Gradually their privileges were under further limitations to be completely dissolved by March Constitution of Poland in 1921. Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line.

The New York Red Bulls play their home games at Red Bull Arena in nearby Harrison, New Jersey.

A new version of the New York Cosmos was formed in 2010, and began play in the second division North American Soccer League in 2013. The Cosmos play their home games at James M. Shuart Stadium on the campus of Hofstra University, just outside the New York City limits in Hempstead, New York. Also emerging during this period was New York's no wave movement, a short-lived art and music scene that began in part as a reaction against punk's recycling of traditionalist rock tropes and often reflected an abrasive, confrontational and nihilistic worldview. No wave musicians such as the Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, DNA, Theoretical Girls and Rhys Chatham instead experimented with noise, dissonance and atonality in addition to non-rock styles. The former four groups were included on the Eno-produced No New York compilation, often considered the quintessential testament to the scene. The no wave-affiliated label ZE Records was founded in 1978, and would also produce acclaimed and influential compilations in subsequent years.

The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, Nama and, since about the 14th century AD, by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion from central Africa. From the late 18th century onwards, Orlam clans from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia. Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries accompanying the Orlams were well received by them, the right to use waterholes and grazing was granted against an annual payment.

Zhengtong had the following message delivered to the Great Treasure Prince of Dharma, the Karmapa: During his travels beginning in 1403, Deshin Shekpa was induced by further exhortations by the Ming court to visit Nanjing by April 10, 1407. Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him.

The label's country division MCA Nashville is a still active imprint of Universal Music Group Nashville. MCA Records picked up the reissue rights for \"Con-Test\", as well as Nash's \"American Band-ages\" in 1986, but the abrupt change in record labels led to a near-absence of promotion for both records.

The album was released on November 15, 2010. While most artists became established in other formats before moving to adult contemporary, Michael Buble\u0301 and Josh Groban started out as AC artists. Throughout this decade, artists such as Nick Lachey, James Blunt, John Mayer, Bruno Mars, Jason Mraz, Kelly Clarkson, Adele, Clay Aiken and Susan Boyle have become successful thanks to a ballad heavy sound.

Its extensive coastlines on the Persian Gulf and Red Sea provide great leverage on shipping (especially crude oil) through the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal. The kingdom occupies 80% of the Arabian Peninsula. Most of the country's boundaries with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and the Republic of Yemen (formerly two separate countries: the Yemen Arab Republic or North Yemen; and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen or South Yemen) are undefined, so the exact size of the country remains unknown. The Saudi government estimate is at 2,217,949 square kilometres, while other reputable estimates vary between 2,149,690 and 2,240,000 sq. kilometres. Less than 1% of the total area is suitable for cultivation, and in the early 1990s, population distribution varied greatly among the towns of the eastern and western coastal areas, the densely populated interior oases, and the vast, almost empty deserts. For much of the region's history a patchwork of tribal rulers controlled most of the area. The Al Saud (the Saudi royal family) emerged as minor tribal rulers in Najd in central Arabia. From the mid-18th century, imbued with the religious zeal of the Wahhabi Islamic movement, they became aggressively expansionist. Over the following 150 years, the extent of the Al Saud territory fluctuated. However, between 1902 and 1927, the Al Saud leader, Abdulaziz, carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1930.

The second half of the 19th century witnessed certain economic developments that greatly changed the economy of Shiraz. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 allowed the extensive import into southern Iran of inexpensive European factory-made goods, either directly from Europe or via India. Farmers in unprecedented numbers began planting cash crops such as opium poppy, tobacco, and cotton. Many of these export crops passed through Shiraz on their way to the Persian Gulf. Iranian long-distance merchants from Fars developed marketing networks for these commodities, establishing trading houses in Bombay, Calcutta, Port Said, Istanbul and even Hong Kong.Shiraz's economic base is in its provincial products, which include grapes, citrus fruits, cotton and rice.

His most noted work was a statue of Tyche, which he made for the city of Antioch, then newly founded. The goddess, who embodied the idea of the city, was seated on a rock, crowned with towers, and having the river Orontes at her feet. There is a small copy of the statue in the Vatican. It was imitated by a number of Asiatic cities; and indeed most statues since created that commemorate cities borrow something from the work of Eutychides. In Greek mythology, Sicyon (; ) is the eponym of the polis of the same name, which was said to have previously been known as Aegiale and, earlier, Mecone. His father is named variously as Marathon, Metion, Erechtheus or Pelops. Sicyon married Zeuxippe, the daughter of Lamedon, the previous king of the polis and region that would come to be named after him. They had a daughter Chthonophyle, who bore two sons: Polybus to Hermes and, later, Androdamas to Phlius, the son of Dionysus. However, in some accounts, Chthnophyle bore Phlius to Dionysus instead.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (\u674e\u63d0\u514b\u8fea\u65af, has_program, \u83b1\u897f\u666e\u65af\u652f\u6301\u7684\u96d5\u5851\u5bb6\u57f9\u8bad\u9879\u76ee)\n- (\u674e\u63d0\u514b\u8fea\u65af, \u521b\u4f5c\u4f5c\u54c1, \u4e3a\u5b89\u63d0\u5965\u514b\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf)\n- (\u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf, \u5305\u542b\u5143\u7d20, \u5965\u9f99\u7279\u65af\u6cb3\u5730\u7406\u7279\u5f81)\n- (\u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf, \u5305\u542b\u5143\u7d20, \u897f\u5b54\u7684\u8c61\u5f81\u610f\u4e49)\n- (\u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf, \u4f7f\u7528\u5143\u7d20, \u96c5\u5409\u52d2\u548c\u6885\u79d1\u5185\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5386\u53f2)\n- (\u68b5\u8482\u5188, \u4fdd\u5b58\u7740, \u5c0f\u578b\u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf\u590d\u5236\u54c1)\n- (\u5c0f\u578b\u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf\u590d\u5236\u54c1, \u53cd\u6620, \u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6587\u5316\u91cd\u8981\u6027)\n- (\u8bb8\u591a\u4e9a\u6d32\u57ce\u5e02, \u8d5e\u8d4f\u5e76\u6a21\u4eff, \u5854\u514b\u5e0c\u96d5\u50cf)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

La fida ninfa (\"The Faithful Nymph\") is an opera by Antonio Vivaldi to a libretto by Scipione Maffei. The opera was first performed for the opening of the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona on 6 January 1732. Among the arias is \"Alma oppressa de sorte crudele\" (\"Soul oppressed by cruel fate\"). Orlando furioso RV 819 (, Teatro San Angelo, Venice 1714) is a three-act opera surviving in manuscript in Antonio Vivaldi's personal library, only partly related to his better known Orlando furioso (RV 728) of 1727. It is a recomposition of an \"Orlando furioso\" written by Giovanni Alberto Ristori which had been very successfully staged by Vivaldi and his father's \"impresa\" in 1713, and whose music survives in a few fragments retained in the score of RV 819. Therefore, Vivaldi's first cataloguer Peter Ryom did not assign the opera a RV number, but catalogued it as RV Anh. 84.

Norbu writes that the Yongle Emperor, following the tradition of Mongol emperors and their reverence for the Sakya lamas, showed an enormous amount of deference towards Deshin Shekpa. The Yongle Emperor came out of the palace in Nanjing to greet the Karmapa and did not require him to kowtow like a tributary vassal. According to Karma Thinley, the emperor gave the Karmapa the place of honor at his left, and on a higher throne than his own. Rossabi and others describe a similar arrangement made by Kublai Khan and the Sakya Phagpa lama, writing that Kublai would \"sit on a lower platform than the Tibetan cleric\" when receiving religious instructions from him. The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC preserves an edict of the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435\u20131449) addressed to the Karmapa in 1445, written after the latter's agent had brought holy relics to the Ming court.

McClain is known for his efforts to establish the ancient mathematical discipline of music as the means to unlock the deepest meaning of history's great religious and philosophical texts. His writings offer a musical-mathematical explanation of crucial passages in texts of world literature, including the Bible, the Rig Veda, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and Plato. All of these passages deal with numbers that he claimed had either been ignored or misinterpreted throughout the centuries. McClain's explanation is based on the meanings of these numbers within the context of the quadrivium, the four ancient mathematical disciplines of arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. His discovery of identical or similar numbers and parallel mathematical constructs in Sumer, Egypt, Babylon, Palestine and Greece, suggests the historical continuity of a common spiritual tradition linking the microcosm of the soul to the macrocosm of the universe.

Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Anhalt-Bitterfeld, the district-free city of Dessau-Ro\u00dflau, the districts of Potsdam-Mittelmark, Teltow-Fla\u0308ming and Elbe-Elster in Brandenburg, and the district of Nordsachsen in the Free State of Saxony. Despite Martin Luther's harsh polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the ecumenical councils and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the Theotokos or Mother of God. Special attention is given to the assertion that Luther, some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life. For Luther, early in his life, the Assumption of Mary was an understood fact, although he later stated that the Bible did not say anything about it and stopped celebrating its feast. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death. \"Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics.

He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating saints' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be idolatry. His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (his views, supports, criticism of papists for blurring line between grace of god and religious service in wittenberg context)\n- (luther\u2019s theological stance, influences, critique of papists for blurring line between grace of god and religious service in wittenberg context)\n- (criticism of papists, includes, opposition to high admiration of saints' days and mary and other departed saints in wittenberg context)\n- (perceived corruption, impacts, protestant reformation in wittenberg context)\n- (protestant reformation, is_result_of, luther's criticisms leading to significant changes in doctrine and practice in wittenberg context)\n- (luther\u2019s criticisms, targets, papists' practices of blurring line between grace of god and religious service in wittenberg context)\n- (wittenberg context, includes, jan hus, peter waldo, john wycliffe, ninety-five theses, sale of indulgences, pope, purgatory, catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints, bible, sola scriptura, faith in jesus, good works, god's pardon for sin, western schism, roman curia, humanism, renaissance)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

The Toyopet Master was an evolution of an earlier Toyota sedan called the Toyota SF/RH model (also known as the Super), and was sold in parallel with the first Toyota Crown. The more conservative Master was introduced as a frugally equipped version meant for taxi usage. The Master and Crown shared the same R-series engine, which produces in the Master. It was sold at a chain of Toyota Japan dealerships called \"Toyota Store\", next to the more upscale Crown, which was intended as a private purchase alternative to the Master. The Acura Legend is a mid-size luxury/executive car manufactured by Honda. It was sold in the U.S., Canada, and parts of China under Honda's luxury brand, Acura, from 1985 to 1995, as both a sedan, which was classified as a full-size car, and a coupe, which was classified as a mid-size car (similar to how the Honda Accord is set up today). It was the first flagship sedan sold under the Acura nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the Acura 3.5RL. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend. Some buyers lamented the small size of the first Japanese compacts, and both Toyota and Nissan (then known as Datsun) introduced larger cars such as the Toyota Corona Mark II, the Toyota Cressida, the Mazda 616 and Datsun 810, which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning, power steering, AM-FM radios, and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (sf/rh model, includes_in, toyopet master)\n- (toyopet master, uses, ladder frame)\n- (toyopet master, uses, leaf sprung front and rear axles)\n- (toyopet master, is_sold_at, toyota store)\n- (toyota crown, shares_market_with, toyopet master)\n- (toyopet master, includes_features_from, sf/rh model)\n- (toyopet master, characterized_by, frugal equipment)\n- (toyopet master, intended_for, taxi usage)\n- (toyopet master, uses, r-series engine)\n- (crown, uses, r-series engine)\n- (acura legend, evolves_into, acura 3.5rl)\n- (japanese compacts, context_of, larger cars introduced by toyota, nissan, mazda, datsun)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

They settled in Zhangzhou and brought the Middle Chinese phonology of northern China during the 7th century into Zhangzhou; In 885, (during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang), the two brothers Wang Chao (\u738b\u6f6e) and Wang Shenzhi (\u738b\u5be9\u77e5), led a military expedition force to pacify the Huang Chao rebellion. They brought the Middle Chinese phonology commonly spoken in Northern China into Zhangzhou.

It was shot in black-and-white and was co-directed by Melina Matsoukas alongside Knowles for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was released the same month; \"Suga Mama\" was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the video album. It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair, wearing men's clothing and smoking a cigar. She gets up and begins to pole dance. The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube, dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed, lying in a circle of light, and riding a mechanical bull. Knowles said she is meant to \"slowly become a woman\" during the video, adding \"Well, a sexier woman \u2013 I'm always a woman.\"Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars, which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never previously been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00 am that they completed work. The recorded history of Austin, Texas, began in the 1830s when Anglo - American settlers arrived in Central Texas. In 1837 settlers founded the village of Waterloo on the banks of the Colorado River, the first permanent settlement in the area.\"\"\"\n\nTriplets:\n- (suga mama, supports, b'day anthology video album)\n- (b'day anthology video album, has_release_date, april 2007)\n- (b'day anthology video album, includes, suga mama)\n- (suga mama, was_shot_in, two weeks)\n- (suga mama, alongside, eight other videos for the album)\n- (suga mama, includes, pole dancing sequences)\n- (suga mama, includes, sugar cube dancing sequences)\n- (suga mama, includes, mechanical bull riding sequences)\n- (pole dancing sequences, uses, ballet bars as training equipment)\n- (mechanical bull sequence, filmed_at, twelve frames per second)\n- (beyonc\u00e9 knowles, rehearsed_pole_dancing, two ballet bars before film)\n- (melina matsoukas, co-directed_video_with, beyonc\u00e9 knowles)\n- (suga mama, was_shot_in, austin texas)\n- (austin texas, recorded_history_beginning_at, waterloo)\n- (waterloo, founded_in, 1837 on the banks of the coloredado river)\n- (anglo-american settlers, arrived_in_central_texas_in, the 1830s)\n- (anglo-american settlers, led_to_establishment_of, waterloo)\n\nCompleteness Scoring Rubric:\nCompleteness Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully captures all Ground Truth facts with possibly helpful relevant detail.\n- 8-9: Covers most facts clearly with minor omissions or some additional context that does not contradict.\n- 6-7: Captures some key facts but misses several points or adds moderately extraneous/non-contradictory info.\n- 4-5: Partial coverage with many omissions or questionable additional info.\n- 1-3: Contains little of the Ground Truth facts.\n- 0: No relevant facts are present or answer is misleading.\n\nAccuracy Scoring Rubric:\nAccuracy Scoring Guide (0-10):\n- 10: Fully accurate; no factual errors.\n- 8-9: Mostly accurate with minor trivial errors or consistent additions.\n- 6-7: Some factual inaccuracies or minor misinterpretations.\n- 4-5: Several incorrect points.\n- 1-3: Largely incorrect.\n- 0: Completely false or unrelated.\n\nProvide scores in this JSON format:\n{\n  \"completeness\": <number from 0 to 10>,\n  \"accuracy\": <number from 0 to 10>\n}"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 256}}

His final thoughts on Marian devotion and veneration are preserved in a sermon preached at Wittenberg only a month before his death: John Kodwo Amissah (November 27, 1922 \u2013 September 22, 1991) was a Ghanaian prelate of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Cape Coast from 1959 until his death. Although there had been significant earlier attempts to reform the Catholic Church before Luther -- such as those of Jan Hus, Peter Waldo, and John Wycliffe -- Martin Luther is widely acknowledged to have started the Reformation with the Ninety - five Theses. Luther began by criticising the sale of indulgences, insisting that the Pope had no authority over purgatory and that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the Bible. The Protestant Reformation, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as a complete reliance on Scripture as a source of proper belief (sola scriptura) and the belief that faith in Jesus, and not good works, is the only way to obtain God's pardon for sin (sola fide). The core motivation behind these changes was theological, though many other factors played a part, including the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much traditional thought.

The two platforms were later launched in North America in 1989 as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis respectively. Both systems were built on 16-bit architectures and offered improved graphics and sound over the 8-bit NES. However, it took several years for Sega's system to become successful. Nintendo executives were in no rush to design a new system, but they reconsidered when they began to see their dominance in the market slipping. Xexyz (pronounced zeks'-zees/zeks'-iz), known in Japan as , is a 1988 video game published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released in Japan on August 26, 1988, and saw a North American release sometime in April, 1990. The game was never released in Europe and the game is not playable on PAL consoles. The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo.

After two years as research assistant at Hoffmann-La Roche, he continued postgraduate studies at University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under professor Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1947. He remained at the university until 1949 as Rackham and Lloyd Postdoctoral Fellow. From 1949 to 1954, Dreiding was assistant professor at Wayne University, Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. He also temporarily took over Bachmann's teaching and research duties at the University of Michigan after Bachmann's death in 1951, and held them until 1952.

This directory documented Reformed worship practices and theology adopted and developed over the preceding century by British Puritans, initially guided by John Calvin and John Knox. It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere. The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle, which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members. There are 131 seats in the debating chamber. Of the total 131 seats, 129 are occupied by the Parliament's elected MSPs and 2 are seats for the Scottish Law Officers \u2013 the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, who are not elected members of the Parliament but are members of the Scottish Government. As such the Law Officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the Parliament but, as they are not elected MSPs, cannot vote. Members are able to sit anywhere in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in the front row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits in the middle of the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side.
