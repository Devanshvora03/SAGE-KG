### Pair 101
**Question:** Which film has the director who died first, The Piper'S Price or The Blonde From Singapore?
**Ground Truth:** The Piper'S Price
**Retrieved Answer:** The question of which film has the director who died first, 'The Piper's Price' or 'The Blonde From Singapore,' is complex due to the varying reports on the directors associated with each film.
1. **Directors and Their Deaths**:
- 'The Piper's Price' has been attributed to multiple directors in different reports, including Jack Lee (died 2002), Howard Winchel Koch (died 2001), Wolfgang Schleif (died 2006), Robert Florey (died 1979), and others.
- 'The Blonde From Singapore' has also been linked to various directors, such as Alfred Hitchcock (died 1980), John Gilling (died 2002), John Paddy Carstairs (died 1990), and others.
2. **Key Findings**:
- If we consider the earliest death, Robert Florey, who directed 'The Piper's Price' and died in 1979, is the earliest among the directors mentioned for 'The Piper's Price.' In contrast, John Paddy Carstairs, who directed 'The Blonde From Singapore,' died in 1990, making 'The Piper's Price' the film with the director who died first in this context [Data: Reports (6, 8, 9, 19, +more)].
- However, if we consider the reports that indicate both films share the same director, such as Armand Mastroianni, the question becomes moot as the death date is not provided for him [Data: Reports (7, +more)].
3. **Conclusion**:
- Based on the available data, 'The Piper's Price' has the director who died first when considering the earliest death among the directors mentioned, specifically Robert Florey [Data: Reports (6, 8, 9, 19, +more)]. However, if both films are directed by the same individual, the question of which film has the director who died first is not applicable.
Thus, the answer may vary depending on the specific director attributed to each film.

### Pair 269
**Question:** Which film has the director who was born earlier, The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff or The Pocket-Knife?
**Ground Truth:** The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff
**Retrieved Answer:** Based on the available data, the determination of which film has the director born earlier is complex due to multiple reports indicating different directors for each film.
1. **Shared Directors**: In some instances, both films share the same director, such as Leonid Kvinikhid, who was born in 1923, making it impossible to ascertain which film has an earlier-born director since they are the same person [Data: Reports (20, 21)].
2. **Different Directors**: In cases where different directors are mentioned, such as Michał Waszyński (born 1904) for 'The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff' and Ian Barry (born 1943) for 'The Pocket-Knife', it is clear that 'The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff' has the earlier-born director [Data: Reports (4)].
3. **Other Comparisons**: Other reports also indicate various directors for both films, with some directors of 'The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff' being born earlier than those of 'The Pocket-Knife', such as T. V. Chandran, who is noted for his significant contributions to cinema [Data: Reports (13)].
In conclusion, while there are instances where 'The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff' has a director born earlier, the presence of shared directors complicates the overall comparison. Therefore, without a definitive answer across all reports, it may be concluded that 'The Marriage Of Princess Demidoff' generally has instances of earlier-born directors, but the shared directors create ambiguity [Data: Reports (1, 2, 10, 15, 19, +more)].
