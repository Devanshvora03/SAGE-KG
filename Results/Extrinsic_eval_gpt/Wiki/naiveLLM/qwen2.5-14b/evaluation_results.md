**Ground Truth:** Because They'Re Young
**Retrieved Answer:** Because They're Young was directed by Charles Stone III, who was born on February 10, 1952. "Farewell Performance" appears to be a less recognized title, and without specific information about this film's director or its existence as a distinct entity in major film databases, it is challenging to provide an accurate comparison. However, based on the available data, Charles Stone III's birth date places him later than many directors of films from similar periods, but for a precise comparative answer, details about "Farewell Performance" are missing. Given the information provided and available knowledge: Because They're Young has the director born later than Farewell Performance can be determined based on the mentioned film alone.

**Question:** Which film was released more recently, Son Of Cain or The Parallax View?
**Ground Truth:** Son Of Cain
**Retrieved Answer:** The Parallax View was released more recently than Son Of Cain. Son Of Cain was released in 1980, while The Parallax View was released in 1974. However, if you are asking for a recent release context, there might have been remakes or re-releases, but based on original releases, the statement needs correction: The Parallax View is older than Son Of Cain. For recent activity regarding these films, additional research would be needed as neither has notable mentions of newer versions in mainstream media compared to their original release dates.
